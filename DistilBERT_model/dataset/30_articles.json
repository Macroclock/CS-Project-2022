{"text": "Heart transplantation is a life-saving procedure that has seen improvements in transplant and patient outcomes due to advances in immunosuppression and prevention of posttransplantation infectious episodes (IEps). This study systematically evaluates IEps in the modern era of heart transplantation at Stanford University Medical Center. This is a single-center retrospective review that includes 279 consecutive adult heart transplantation recipients from January 2008 to September 2017. Baseline demographic, clinical, serological, and outcomes information were collected. Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to assess survival stratified by IEp occurrence within the first year. A total of 600 IEps occurred in 279 patients (2.15 IEps per patient) during a median follow-up period of 3 years. Overall survival was 83.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 76.2-88.4) at 1 year posttransplantation for those with any IEp compared with 93.0% (95% CI, 87.2-96.4) in those without IEp (P\u2009=\u20090.07). Bacterial IEps were the most common (n\u2009=\u2009375; 62.5%), followed by viral (n\u2009=\u2009180; 30.0%), fungal (n\u2009=\u200940; 6.7%), and parasitic (n\u2009=\u20095; 0.8%). IEps by Gram-negative bacteria (n\u2009=\u2009210) outnumbered those by Gram-positive bacteria (n\u2009=\u2009142). Compared with prior studies from our center, there was a decreased proportion of viral (including cytomegalovirus), fungal (including Aspergillus spp. and non-Aspergillus spp. molds), and Nocardia infections. There were no IEps due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii, or Toxoplasma gondii. A significant reduction in viral, fungal, and Nocardia IEps after heart transplantation was observed, most likely due to advancements in immunosuppression and preventive strategies, including pretransplant infectious diseases screening and antimicrobial prophylaxis.", "label": "1"}{"text": "The number of congenital heart disease (CHD) patients with heart failure is expanding. These patients have a high probability of dying while awaiting heart transplant. The potential for durable ventricular assist devices (VAD) to improve waiting list survival in CHD is unknown. We conducted an analysis of the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database for the primary outcome of death or delisting due to clinical worsening while listed for heart transplant. We compared CHD patients with non-CHD patients matched for listing status. Multivariable models were constructed to account for confounding variables. Congenital heart disease patients were less likely to have a VAD and were more likely to experience the primary outcome of death or delisting due to clinical worsening compared to non-CHD patients. Ventricular assist devices decreased the probability of experiencing the primary outcome for non-CHD but not for CHD patients with a final listing status of 1A. Ventricular assist devices increased the probability of experiencing the primary outcome among CHD patients for those with a final listing status of 1B with no impact in non-CHD patients. Among non-CHD patients who died or were delisted, the time to the primary outcome was delayed by VAD, with a similar trend in CHD. Except for patients with a final listing status of 1B, VAD does not adversely affect waiting list outcomes in CHD patients listed for heart transplant. Ventricular assist devices may prolong waiting list survival among high-risk CHD patients.", "label": "1"}{"text": "Cardiomyopathies might lead to end-stage heart disease with the requirement of drastic treatments like bridging up to transplant or heart transplantation. A not precisely known proportion of these diseases are genetically determined. We genotyped 43 index-patients (30 DCM, 10 ARVC, 3 RCM) with advanced or end stage cardiomyopathy using a gene panel which covered 46 known cardiomyopathy disease genes. Fifty-three variants with possible impact on disease in 33 patients were identified. Of these 27 (51%) were classified as likely pathogenic or pathogenic in the MYH7, MYL2, MYL3, NEXN, TNNC1, TNNI3, DES, LMNA, PKP2, PLN, RBM20, TTN, and CRYAB genes. Fifty-six percent (n = 24) of index-patients carried a likely pathogenic or pathogenic mutation. Of these 75% (n = 18) were familial and 25% (n = 6) sporadic cases. However, severe cardiomyopathy seemed to be not characterized by a specific mutation profile.

In the new heart transplant allocation system, ECMO-supported patients have the highest priority for HT. However, data are lacking on the outcomes of these critically ill patients. We compared the waitlist and post-transplant outcomes of ECMO-supported patients in the new and old allocation systems. Adult patients supported by ECMO at the time of listing or transplantation who were registered in the United Network for Organ Sharing database between November 1, 2015 and September 30, 2019 were included. Clinical characteristics, outcomes in the waitlist, and post-transplant survival were compared between the old and new systems. Cox Proportional and subdistribution hazard regression models were used to evaluate the variables contributing to the post-transplant and waitlist outcomes RESULTS: A total of 296 ECMO-supported patients were listed for HT. Of these, 191 were distributed to the old system, and 105 were distributed to the new system. Patients listed in the new system had a higher cumulative incidence of HT (p < 0.001) and lower incidence of death or removal (p\u202f=\u202f0.001) from the transplant list than patients listed in the old system. The 6-month survival after transplantation was 74.6% and 90.6% for the old- and new-era patients, respectively (p\u202f=\u202f0.002). Among ECMO-supported patients, being listed or transplanted on the new system was independently associated with improved outcomes in the waitlist and after transplantation. With the implementation of the new heart transplant allocation system, ECMO-supported patients have a shorter waitlist time, improved frequency of HT, and improved short-term post-transplant survival.", "label": "1"}{"text": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a major complication after heart transplantation with varying prophylaxis strategies employed. We sought to determine the impact of valganciclovir (VGC) duration on the epidemiology of CMV infections after heart transplantation. We performed a prospective cohort study of CMV donor (D) or recipient (R) seropositive heart transplant recipients from 2005 to 2012 who completed VGC prophylaxis, ranging from 3 to 12\u00a0months according to serostatus and induction immunosuppression. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed. Among 159 heart transplant recipients during the study period, 130 (82%) were eligible for VGC prophylaxis. CMV D/R serostatus was as follows: 24% D+/R-, 30% D+/R+, and 29% D-/R+. 65% and 21% received basiliximab and thymoglobulin induction, respectively, followed by maintenance tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. Twenty-one (16%) recipients suffered CMV infection. There was no association with comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, or mechanical assist devices, nor were there associations with rejection, treatments of rejection, or mortality. When VGC prophylaxis duration was stratified by \u22646 vs \u226512\u00a0months, time from heart transplantation to CMV infection was delayed (median 247 vs 452\u00a0days, P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) but there was no difference in days from VGC discontinuation to onset of CMV infection (median 72 vs 83\u00a0days, P\u00a0=\u00a0.31). CMV infection occurred most frequently within 6-16\u00a0weeks of VGC cessation, and 95% of infections occurred during the 6\u00a0months post-prophylaxis period.

We examined the effect of sensitization and status 4S and developed a predictive model to estimate waiting time in Canada. A retrospective review was performed of patients listed for heart transplant at the Ottawa Heart Institute and Toronto General Hospital (Ontario, Canada). We evaluated the association of CPRA and priority listing status on waiting time and post-transplant outcomes. Waiting time risk factor analysis was performed using a multivariable parametric accelerated failure time model with a Weibull distribution. Of 394 patients listed (75% male, 51 \u00b1 12 years), 291 (74%) received a transplant and 33 (8%) died waiting. The cumulative incidence of transplant decreased across higher CPRA groups but was similar for moderately and highly sensitized groups: 67%, 70%, 50%, and 40% at 12 months for CPRA 0%, 1% to 50%, 51% to 80%, and > 80%, respectively (p\u202f=\u202f0.020). Status 4S patients experienced longer waiting times compared with other high priority status 3.5 and 4 and had increased risk of death on the waiting list (p\u202f=\u202f0.014). Over a median follow-up of 2.4 years (interquartile range, 1.2-4.1), rejection occurred in 64 sensitized patients (24%) compared with 24 non-sensitized patients (9%; p\u202f=\u202f0.019), but there was no difference in survival, allograft dysfunction, or cardiac allograft vasculopathy. A model predicting transplant waiting time, including CPRA, blood group, priority listing status, age, and weight, was developed and showed adequate discrimination and calibration. Waiting time to heart transplant is increased for highly and moderately sensitized patients, suggesting the need to reevaluate the CPRA > 80% threshold for status 4S prioritization in Canada. Extended waiting times, despite 4S prioritization, supports consideration of additional factors to CPRA in ensuring equitable organ access for sensitized patients.", "label": "0"}{"text": "Enhanced platelet reactivity may play a role in cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) progression. The use of antiplatelet agents after heart transplantation (HT) has been inconsistent and although aspirin (ASA) is often a part of the medication regimen after HT, limited evidence is available on its benefit. CAV progression was assessed by measuring the difference in plaque volume and plaque index between the last follow-up and the baseline coronary intravascular ultrasound examination. Overall, 529 HT recipients were retrospectively analyzed (337 had \u22652 intravascular ultrasound studies). The progression in plaque volume (P\u202f=\u202f.007) and plaque index (P\u202f=\u202f.002) was significantly attenuated among patients treated with early ASA (within the first year after HT). Over a 6.7-year follow-up, all-cause mortality was lower with early ASA compared with late or no ASA use (P < .001). No cardiac deaths were observed in the early ASA group, and the risk of CAV-related graft dysfunction was significantly lower in this group (P\u202f=\u202f.03). However, the composite of all CAV-related events (cardiac death, CAV-related graft dysfunction, or coronary angioplasty) was not significantly different between the groups (P\u202f=\u202f.16).

Little data exist to guide decision-making with regard to repeat retransplantation in older patients. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of patients receiving a third HTx, as identified in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database from 1985 to 2017. The study cohort consisted of N\u00a0=\u00a060 patients, with an average age of 29 with a standard deviation of \u00b118\u00a0years.

Criteria for HT listing do not differ between patients medically managed and those mechanically bridged to HT. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the impact of BTT with LVAD on posttransplantation survival, to describe differences in causes of 1-year mortality in medically and mechanically bridged patients, and to evaluate differences in risk factors for 1-year mortality between those with and those without LVAD at the time of HT. Using the United Network of Organ Sharing database, we identified 5486 adult, single-organ HT recipients transplanted between 2008 and 2015. Patients were propensity matched for likelihood of LVAD at the time of HT. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were used to assess the impact of BTT on 1- and 5-year mortality. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the odds ratio of 1-year mortality for patients BTT with LVAD compared with those with medical management across clinically significant variables at various thresholds. Early mortality was higher in mechanically bridged patients: 9.5% versus 7.2% mortality at 1 year (P<0.001). BTT patients incurred an increased risk of 1-year mortality with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 40 to 60 mL\u00b7min Bridge to HT with LVAD, although necessary because of organ scarcity and capable of improving wait list survival, confers a significantly higher risk of early posttransplantation mortality.

Due to the complexity of transplantation and the wide range of possible serious complications, recipient outcomes are difficult to predict accurately using conventional multivariable regression. Therefore, we evaluated the utility of 3 ML algorithms for predicting mortality after pediatric HTx. We identified patients <18\u00a0years of age receiving HTx in 2006-2015 in the UNOS Registry database. Mortality within 1, 3, or 5\u00a0years was predicted using classification and regression trees, RFs, and ANN. Each model was trained using cross-validation, then validated in a separate testing set. Model performance was primarily evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve. The training set included 2802 patients, whereas 700 were included in the testing set. RF achieved the best fit to the training data with AUCs of 0.74, 0.68, and 0.64 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality, respectively, and performed best in the testing data, with AUCs of 0.72, 0.61, and 0.60, respectively. Nevertheless, sensitivity was poor across models (training: 0.22-0.58; testing: 0.07-0.49). ML algorithms demonstrated fair predictive utility in both training and testing data, but the sensitivity of these algorithms was generally poor.

Use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock has increased worldwide recently. The aim of the current analysis was to outline the trends in use, changing patient profiles, and in-hospital outcomes including complications in patients undergoing venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock. Analysis of extracorporeal life support organization registry from January 2010 to December 2018. Multicenter worldwide registry. Seven-thousand one-hundred eighty-five patients supported with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Hospital death, weaning from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, hospital complications. Mortality predictors were assessed by multivariable logistic regression. Propensity score matching was performed for comparison of peripheral and central cannulation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. A significant trend toward more extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use in recent years (coefficient, 0.009; p < 0.001) was found. Mean age was 56.3 \u00b1 14.9 years and significantly increased over time (coefficient, 0.513; p < 0.001). Most commonly, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was instituted after coronary artery bypass surgery (26.8%) and valvular surgery (25.6%), followed by heart transplantation (20.7%). Overall, successful extracorporeal membrane oxygenation weaning was possible in 4,520 cases (56.4%), and survival to hospital discharge was achieved in 41.7% of cases. In-hospital mortality rates remained constant over time (coefficient, -8.775; p = 0.682), whereas complication rates were significantly reduced (coefficient, -0.009; p = 0.003).

Current knowledge on incidence, pathophysiology and natural history of HF in cardiomyopathies is limited, and distinct features of their therapeutic responses have not been systematically addressed. Therefore, this position paper focuses on epidemiology, pathophysiology, natural history and latest developments in treatment of HF in patients with dilated (DCM), hypertrophic (HCM) and restrictive (RCM) cardiomyopathies. In DCM, HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has high incidence and prevalence and represents the most frequent cause of death, despite improvements in treatment. In addition, advanced HF in DCM is one of the leading indications for heart transplantation. In HCM, HF with preserved ejection (HFpEF) affects most patients with obstructive, and \u223c10% of patients with non-obstructive HCM. A timely treatment is important, since development of advanced HF, although rare in HCM, portends a poor prognosis. In RCM, HFpEF is common, while HFrEF occurs later and more frequently in amyloidosis or iron overload/haemochromatosis. Irrespective of RCM aetiology, HF is a harbinger of a poor outcome. Recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of HF in cardiomyopathies have significant implications for therapeutic decision-making. In addition, new aetiology-specific treatment options (e.g. enzyme replacement therapy, transthyretin stabilizers, immunoadsorption, immunotherapy, etc.) have shown a potential to improve outcomes.

However, we noted a diverging trend towards a lower cumulative incidence of transplant for patients with a BMI >32. BTC is common in the UK and appears clinically effective, given that the survival rates and the incidence of transplants were comparable with those for BTT. Patients with a high BMI have a worse survival rate through to 1\u2009year and a trend for a lower incidence of a transplant. Patients with a low eGFR also have a worse survival rate, but a similar proportion received transplants.", "label": "0"}{"text": "Perioperative cardiac xenograft dysfunction (PCXD) was described by McGregor and colleagues as a major barrier to the translation of heterotopic cardiac xenotransplantation into the orthotopic position. It is characterized by graft dysfunction in the absence of rejection within 24 to 48 hours of transplantation. We describe our experience with PCXD at a single program. Orthotopic transplantation of genetically engineered pig hearts was performed in 6 healthy baboons. The immunosuppression regimen included induction by anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAb), thymoglobulin, cobra venom factor, and anti-CD40 mAb, and maintenance with anti-CD40 mAb, mycophenolate mofetil, and tapering doses of steroids. Telemetry was used to assess graft function. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used to support 1 recipient. A full human clinical transplantation team was involved in these experiments and the procedure was performed by skilled transplantation surgeons. A maximal survival of 40 hours was achieved in these experiments. The surgical procedures were uneventful, and all hearts were weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass without issue. Support with inotropes and vasopressors was generally required after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass. The cardiac xenografts performed well immediately, but within the first several hours they required increasing support and ultimately resulted in arrest despite maximal interventions. All hearts were explanted immediately; histology showed no signs of rejection. Despite excellent surgical technique, uneventful weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, and adequate initial function, orthotopic cardiac xenografts slowly fail within 24 to 48 hours without evidence of rejection. Modification of preservation techniques and minimizing donor organ ischemic time may be able to ameliorate PCXD.", "label": "0"}{"text": "Cardiac allografts from donors with a history of cocaine use (DHCU) are often discarded owing to concerns regarding organ quality. We investigated long-term outcomes of de novo adult heart transplantation (HTx) using DHCU. Using the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Thoracic Organ Transplant Registry, we identified 24,430 adult recipients of primary, deceased donor, heart-alone transplants between January 1, 2000, and June 30, 2013. Transplants were categorized on the basis of DHCU. Survival rates were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. A total of 3,246 (13.3%) HTx were performed using DHCU during the study period. Of these, 1,477 (45.5%) were classified as current users. Organs from DHCU were transplanted at a later sequence number (data from a sub-group of patients transplanted in the United States) than those from the non-cocaine use group (mean sequence number 16.1 \u00b1 55.6 vs 11.5 \u00b1 38.2; p < 0.001), suggesting higher decline rates by centers. Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were not different between groups (p\u202f=\u202f0.16), with post-transplant survival rates at 1, 5, and 10 years of 88.1%, 75.8%, and 58.5%, respectively, in the non-cocaine use group and 90.0%, 76.7%, and 59.7%, respectively, in the DHCU group. On multivariate analysis, DHCU were not associated with mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.88-1.00; p\u202f=\u202f0.050), cardiac allograft vasculopathy (HR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.94-1.11; p\u202f=\u202f0.56), or allograft rejection (HR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.92-1.05; p\u202f=\u202f0.61). Our findings demonstrate that adult HTx performed using DHCU is not associated with an adverse impact on long-term clinical outcomes. These findings should spur efforts to reduce discard rates of organs from DHCU.", "label": "0"}{"text": "Although several electrocardiographic features of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) (also called dysplasia) have been described, total 12-lead QRS voltage is not one of them. This report describes total 12-lead QRS voltage in 11 patients with ARVC who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) because of progressively severe heart failure. Additionally, it illustrates the varied morphologic features of ARVC. The total 12-lead nonpaced QRS voltages before OHT ranged from 28 to 118 mm (mean 74 \u00b1 32), and those in the paced tracings, from 33 to 129 mm (62 \u00b1 32). The voltages are the lowest we have encountered among 12 previously reported cardiovascular conditions. The heart weights among the 11 ARVC patients ranged from 285 to 670 g (mean 448 \u00b1 125). Very low 12-lead QRS voltage is characteristic of patients with ARVC with heart failure severe enough to warrant OHT, and thus may serve as a clue to its diagnosis.", "label": "0"}{"text": "Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) remains a major impediment to long-term survival after heart transplantation (HT). We investigated the incidence, disease course, and risk factors for CAV. Among 399 patients who underwent HT between November 1992 and July 2014, 297 survivors were reviewed. Endpoints were CAV development and the composite outcome of death or re-HT. During 5.6\u00b15.2\u00a0years, CAV was detected in 54 patients: 45 (83.3%), 8 (14.8%), and 1 (1.8%) patients for CAV 1, 2, and 3, respectively. At 1, 5, and 10\u00a0years, 99.0%, 82.4%, and 60.3% of patients were free of CAV, respectively. Only four patients (7.4%) showed progression over 4.8\u00b12.1\u00a0years' follow-up. The presence of CAV did not affect the composite outcome (P=.89). Predictors of CAV included donor age (HR1.06, 95% CI: 1.03-1.10: P<.001), recipient age (1.03 [1.003-1.06]; P=.03), ischemic time >240\u00a0minutes (3.15 [1.36-7.28], P=.007), postoperative renal replacement therapy (RRT) (7.1 [2.3-21.8]; P=.001), and triglyceride level at 1\u00a0year post-HT (1.005 [1.002-1.008], P=.003). CAV incidence after HT appears acceptable, with most cases being stationary and inconsequential for survival. Development of CAV seems to be influenced by donor and recipient age, ischemic time, postoperative RRT, and high triglyceride level.", "label": "0"}{"text": "The effect of the new donor heart allocation system on survival following bridging to transplantation with venous-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation remains unknown. The new allocation system places extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-supported candidates at the highest status. The United Network for Organ Sharing database was queried for adults bridged to single-organ heart transplantation with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation from October 2006 to February 2020. Association between implementation of the new system and recipient survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates, Cox proportional hazards models, and propensity score matching. Of 364 recipients included, 173 and 191 were transplanted under new and old systems, respectively. Compared with the old system, waitlist time was halved under the new system (5 versus 10 days,  Recipients transplanted following extracorporeal membrane oxygenation bridging to transplantation under the new system achieve greater 180-day survival compared with the old and demonstrate less preoperative comorbidity.

The exact mechanism and risk factors for this phenomenon remain unknown in the contemporary era. In this study we reviewed adult patients undergoing heart transplantation (HT) at our institution between 2009 and 2017. Severe PGD was defined as the need for mechanical circulatory support (MCS) within the first 24 hours after HT. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for severe PGD, focusing on those bridged to transplant (BTT) with a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD). Fifty-six of 480 (11.7%) HT patients experienced severe PGD. Eighty percent of the severe PGD patients were BTT with a CF-LVAD (odds ratio [OR] 3.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.94 to 7.68, p < 0.001). Among the BTT patients, significant associations between >1 year of CF-LVAD support (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.14 to 5.40, p\u202f=\u202f0.022), pre-HT creatinine (OR 3.35, 95% CI 1.42 to 7.92, p\u202f=\u202f0.006), elevated central venous pressure/pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (CVP/PCWP) ratio (OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.04 to 10.60, p\u202f=\u202f0.043), use of amiodarone before HT (OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.20 to 6.20, p\u202f=\u202f0.022), and severe PGD were identified. RADIAL score did not accurately predict severe PGD in this contemporary cohort. Those patients who developed severe PGD had decreased 1-year post-transplant survival (78.3% vs 91.8%, p\u202f=\u202f0.007). Use of CF-LVAD as BTT is associated with an increased risk of severe PGD. Increased time on device support, renal dysfunction, right ventricular dysfunction as assessed by CVP/PCWP ratio, and pre-transplant amiodarone may identify those patients at high risk. Further research is warranted focusing on optimal timing of device implantation and transplantation, as well as the underlying mechanisms of PGD.", "label": "1"}{"text": "We report the case of a 3-year-old male who developed recurrent Clostridium difficile infection after receiving an orthotopic heart transplant.

However, within 2\u00a0months he developed severe mixed rejection with high circulating donor-specific antibodies and significant coronary vasculopathy.

We examined outcomes of pediatric sHKTx compared to PHTx alone. Our objective was to identify a threshold eGFR that justified pediatric sHKTx. Data from the SRTR heart and kidney databases were used to identify 9245 PHTx, and 63 pediatric sHKTx performed between 1992 and 2017 (age \u226421\u00a0years). The median age for sHKTx was 16\u00a0years, and included 31 males (31/63\u00a0=\u00a049%). Over half of sHKTx (36/63\u00a0=\u00a057%) were performed in cases where pretransplant dialysis was initiated. Among patients who required pretransplant dialysis, the risk of death in sHKTx recipients was significantly lower than PHTx alone (sHKTx vs. PHTx: HR 0.4, 95% CI [0.2, 0.9], p\u00a0=\u00a0.01). In those without pretransplant dialysis, there was no improvement in survival between sHKTx and PHTx (p\u00a0=\u00a0.2).
