{"text": "The Spanish Lung Transplant Registry: first report of results (2006-2010). The Spanish Lung Transplant Registry (SLTR) began its activities in 2006 with the participation of all the lung transplantation (LT) groups with active programs in Spain. This report presents for the first time an overall description and results of the patients who received lung transplants in Spain from 2006 to 2010. LT activity has grown progressively, and in this time period 951 adults and 31 children underwent lung transplantation. The mean age of the recipients was 48.2, while the mean age among the lung donors was 41.7. In adult LT, the most frequent cause for lung transplantation was emphysema/COPD, followed by idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, both representing more than 60% the total number of indications. The probability for survival after adult LT to one and three years was 72% and 60%, respectively, although in patients who survived until the third month post-transplantation, these survival rates reached 89.7% and 75.2%. The factors that most clearly influenced patient survival were the age of the recipient and the diagnosis that indicated the transplantation. Among the pediatric transplantations, cystic fibrosis was the main cause for transplantation (68%), with a one-year survival of 80% and a three-year survival of 70%. In adult as well as pediatric transplantations, the most frequent cause of death was infection. These data confirm the consolidated situation of LT in Spain as a therapeutic option for advanced chronic respiratory disease, both in children as well as in adults.

We have previously shown that surgical Technical Performance Scores (TPS) are important predictors of early postoperative morbidity across a wide spectrum of procedures and that intraoperative recognition and intervention of residual defects resulted in improved outcomes. We hypothesized that these scores would also be important predictors of midterm outcomes. Neonates and infants aged younger 6 months were prospectively followed from the index surgery for a minimum of 1 year. The TPS were calculated using previously published criteria, including intraoperative course, predischarge echocardiograms or catheterizations, and clinical data, and graded as optimal, adequate, or inadequate. Case complexity was determined by the Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery-1 category. The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcome was the need for unplanned reinterventions. Outcomes were analyzed using nonparametric methods and a logistic regression model. A total of 166 patients were included in our study, with 7 early deaths. The remaining 159 patients (Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery-1 category 4-6, 76 [48%]; neonates, 78 [49%]) were followed for a minimum of 1 year after surgery. There were 14 late deaths or late transplantations and 55 late reinterventions. On univariate analysis, the TPS were associated with mortality (P < .001) and reintervention (P = .04). On logistic regression analysis, inadequate TPS was associated with late mortality (P < .001; odds ratio, 7.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.2-23.6), and Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery-1 category (P = .004; odds ratio, 3.7; 1.5-8.8) at index surgery was associated with need for late unplanned reintervention. Technical performance affects midterm survival after infant heart surgery. Inadequate TPS can be used to prospectively identify patients at ongoing risk of demise and the need for reintervention. An aggressive approach to diagnosing and treating residual lesions at the initial operation is warranted. ", "label": 1}{"text": "Long-term survival (>20 years) following heart transplantation. Only a few papers with patients surviving more than 15 years after heart transplantation have been reported. Herein we report the characteristics of patients transplanted between 1984 and 1989 who are long-term survivors (>20 years). Survival after transplant, recipient and donor age and aetiology of heart failure were also compared with patients transplanted in the decades 1990-1999 and 2000-2009. Our Heart Transplant Program Database and medical records of all cardiac transplants performed in our centre from July 1984 to 1989 were reviewed. Primary endpoint of the study was the long-term survival and secondary end points were the incidence of transplant-related complications over time. Forty-five transplants were performed in 1984-1989, 41 patients were male, median age was 46 years (IQR: 39-55), median donor age was 24 years (19-29) and mean graft ischemic time was 134\u00b164 minutes. The actuarial survival of this cohort was 77.8%, 64.4%, 48.9%, 35.6% and 24.2% at 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 years, respectively. Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed the female gender, the graft ischemic time, the recipient-donor gender mismatch, a diagnosis of diabetes and the number of acute rejection episodes during the first year post-transplant as significant risk factors adversely affecting long-term survival. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is the main cause of death. The mean recipient and donor age and the graft ischemic time have progressively increased over time but survival has not changed. The long-term outcome of heart transplantation is noteworthy. The main limiting factor for survival is the allograft vasculopathy. Considering the tremendous advances in the immunosuppressive therapy and in the understanding of CAV pathophisyology, we can hope for even better results in the next years.

Cardiothoracic transplant programs generally require that transplant recipients have family caregivers to assist them posttransplant. The burden of caregiving on the family members remains poorly understood. If caregivers' well-being is compromised by caregiving, it may bode poorly for transplant recipients' own health in the long-term posttransplant. We examined caregiver health-related quality of life (HRQOL) during the first year after their family member's transplant, its predictors and its relationship to subsequent patient survival. Adult (aged 18+) caregivers of 242 cardiothoracic transplant recipients (lung = 134; heart = 108) completed assessments of demographics, psychosocial characteristics and caregiver burden at 2 months posttransplant, and HRQOL at 2, 7 and 12 months posttransplant. Recipients' survival time was obtained from medical records. Caregiver HRQOL was generally high across the first-year posttransplant in emotional and social functioning; caregiver physical functioning significantly worsened. There were no differences by type of recipient transplant. Greater caregiver burden predicted poorer caregiver HRQOL in several physical domains at 12 months posttransplant. Transplant recipients whose caregivers had lower perceived general health at 12 months posttransplant showed poorer survival rates during the subsequent 7 years of follow up. Transplant teams should identify those caregivers at risk for poorer general health posttransplant to maximize positive outcomes for the entire family.

Although several studies have examined factors affecting survival after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT), few have evaluated the impact of reoperative sternotomy. We undertook this study to examine the incidence and impact of repeat sternotomies on OHT outcomes. We conducted a retrospective review of all adult OHT from 2 institutions. Primary stratification was by the number of prior sternotomies. The primary outcome was survival. Secondary outcomes included blood product utilization and commonly encountered postoperative complications. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models examined mortality while linear regression models examined blood utilization. From January 1995 to October 2011, 631 OHT were performed. Of these, 25 (4.0%) were redo OHT and 182 (28.8%) were bridged to transplant with a ventricular assist device; 356 (56.4%) had undergone at least 1 prior sternotomy. On unadjusted analysis, reoperative sternotomy was associated with decreased 90-day (98.5% vs 90.2%, p<0.001), 1-year (93.1% vs 79.6%, p<0.001), and 5-year (80.4% vs 70.1%, p=0.002) survival. This difference persisted on multivariable analysis at 90 days (hazard ratio [HR] 2.99, p=0.01), 1 year (HR 2.98, p=0.002), and 5 years (HR 1.62, p=0.049). The impact of an increasing number of prior sternotomies was negligible. On multivariable analysis, an increasing number of prior sternotomies was associated with increased intraoperative blood product utilization. Increasing blood utilization was associated with decreased 90-day, 1-year, and 5-year survival. Reoperative sternotomy is associated with increased mortality and blood utilization after OHT. Patients with more than 1 prior sternotomy do not experience additional increased mortality. Carefully selected patients with multiple prior sternotomies have decreased but acceptable outcomes.

To evaluate the contribution of institutional volume and other unmeasured institutional factors beyond volume to the between-center variability in outcomes after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). It is unclear if institutional factors beyond volume have a significant impact on OHT outcomes. The United Network for Organ Sharing registry was used to identify OHTs performed between 2000 and 2010. Separate mixed-effect logistic regression models were constructed, with the primary endpoint being post-OHT mortality. Model A included only individual centers, model B added validated recipient and donor risk indices as well as the year of transplantation, and model C added institutional volume as a continuous variable to model B. The reduction in between-center variability in mortality between models B and C was used to define the contribution of institutional volume. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were also compared after stratifying patients into equal-size tertiles based on center volume. A total of 119 centers performed OHT in 19,156 patients. After adjusting for transplantation year and differences in recipient and donor risk, decreasing center volume was associated with an increased risk of 1-year mortality (P < 0.001). However, procedural volume only accounted for 16.7% of the variability in mortality between centers, and significant between-center variability persisted after adjusting for institutional volume (P<0.001). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, there was significant variability in 1-year survival between centers within each volume category: low-volume (66.7%-96.6%), intermediate-volume (80.7%-97.3%), and high-volume (83.8%-93.9%). These trends were also observed with 5-year mortality. This large-cohort analysis demonstrates that although institutional volume is a significant predictor of post-OHT outcomes, there are other unmeasured institutional factors that contribute substantially to the between-center variability in outcomes. Institutional volume should therefore not be the sole indicator of \"center quality\" in OHT.

The waiting list for heart transplantation (HTx) in Eurotransplant area has grown to a record size of nearly 1,300 patients, whereas only around 600 hearts were transplanted last year. The prolonged time for patients awaiting HTx on the high-urgency (HU) status leads mostly to serious medical complications. The aim of this study was to study the trend of changes in the frequency of ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation in patients on the HU status. A total of 22 adult patients awaiting transplantation on the HU status at our hospital between January 2011 and December 2011 were analyzed, assessing risk profile, blood group, and complication rates in terms of VAD implantation or death. Results were compared with 16 consecutive patients who were on transplant list with the HU status between January 2010 and December 2010 at our institution. Mean age was 49.5 \u00b1 12.1 (2010 group) years and 51.4 \u00b1 10.7 years (2011 group; p = 0.62).

In comparison with the preceding year, only two patients died in 2010 and none of our patients on the HU status had to be provided with mechanical circulatory support. Because of the prolonged waiting time on the HU list, the earlier-mentioned data demonstrate a negative trend in transplant medicine. Especially when taking into consideration that five of seven patients who needed a VAD implantation during the HU waiting period had blood group O. Furthermore, the data derived from Eurotransplant show that the waiting period for patients with blood group O was considerably longer when compared with patients of the same average body height and weight but with other blood groups.

Recalling the popular study of Oscar nominees and using a real-data example from hospital epidemiology, we give innovative and easy-to-understand graphical presentations of how these biases corrupt the analyses via distorted time-at-risk. Cumulative hazard plots and Cox proportional hazards models were used. We are building bridges to medical disciplines such as critical care medicine, hepatology, pharmaco-epidemiology, transplantation medicine, neurology, gynecology and cardiology. In presence of time-dependent bias, the hazard ratio (comparing exposed with unexposed) is artificially underestimated. The length bias leads to an artificial underestimation of the overall hazard. When both biases coexist it can lead to different directions of biased hazard ratios. Since length and time-dependent bias might occur in several medical disciplines, we conclude that understanding and awareness are the best prevention of survival bias.

We analyzed all heart transplantations (HTx) in Sao Paulo state over 8 years for donor profile and recipient risk factors. This multi-institutional review collected HTx data from all institutions in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. From 2002 to 2008 (6 years), only 512 (28.8%) of 1777 available heart donors were accepted for transplantation.

Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have become an established surgical therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure who require hemodynamic support as a bridge-to-transplant or destination therapy. However, the anatomic and physiologic consequences of long-term LVAD support have yet to be fully clarified. Despite the clinical success of these devices, it has been reported that many patients bridged to transplantation with mechanical support develop circulating antibodies with potential donor reactivity. Transplanting against existing or historic donor-specific antibodies is associated with increased risk of antibody-mediated rejection, graft dysfunction, and decreased survival. Safe transplantation of allosensitized patients is dependent on using prospective crossmatching and antibody titer reduction techniques (desensitization). Strict protocols requiring a negative prospective crossmatch before transplantation result in a decreased donor pool and a longer duration of support in sensitized LVAD recipients with increased inherent morbidity such as infections and thromboembolic complications. The aim of this review is to present the current state of knowledge of possible immunologic mechanisms involved in alloimmunization of LVAD recipients, outline new methods of antibody detection, compare various desensitization strategies, and present an overview of clinical data assessing the impact of sensitization on posttransplantation outcome.

The advances in the treatment of many different heart diseases have on the one side led to a significant prolongation of life expectancy but have also contributed to an increase of patients with heart failure. This tendency is supported even more so by the demographic development of our population. The replacement of insufficient organs has always been in the focus of medical research. In the 1960's Shumway and Lower developed the technique of cardiac transplantation and also worked intensively on the treatment and diagnosis of rejection. However, it was Barnard who, in 1967 performed the first human cardiac transplantation. Other centers followed worldwide but the mortality was high and the new therapy was controversially discussed in many journals. By the introduction of cyclosporin as a new immunosuppressive agent in 1978, results improved rapidly and cardiac transplantation became an accepted therapeutic option for patients with end stage heart failure and also for children and newborns with congenital heart defects. Today, with newer immunosuppressive regimens and improved techniques, cardiac transplantation offers excellent results with a long-term survival of nearly 50% of patients after 15 years and among the pediatric population even after 20 years. However, the donor organ shortage as well as the increasing number of elderly patients with end stage heart failure has necessitated work on other alternatives. Neither stem cell transplantation nor xenotransplantation of animal organs are yet an option and there are still some obstacles to be overcome. In contrast, the development of so-called artificial hearts has made significant progress. While the first implants of totally artificial hearts were associated with many comorbidities and patients were seriously debilitated, new devices today offer a reasonable quality of life and long-term survival. Most of these systems are no longer replacing but mainly assisting the heart, which remains in place. These ventricular assist devices have been used as a bridge to transplantation for a long time and are now also offered as a destination therapy for patients who for a variety of reasons are no longer amenable to heart transplantation. Further miniaturization and a decrease of the costs will make these devices a realistic alternative to a sole medical therapy and studies have already proven the superiority in terms of survival as well as rehospitalization rates.

Combined heart-liver transplantation (CHLT) has been utilized as a life-saving procedure in those with end-stage cardiac and hepatic pathology. Techniques and outcomes of this procedure are varied. We sought to review the Cleveland Clinic experience with CHLT. This study is a retrospective chart review of patients who received simultaneous heart and liver transplantation between January 2006 and December 2012. Five patients received CHLT. The mean age was 49 (\u00b1 20) years. All cardiac pathology was nonischemic cardiomyopathy, with a mean ejection fraction of 0.36 (\u00b1 0.13). Three of the 5 were on preoperative inotropic support, 1 of which required placement of a total artificial heart for support pretransplant. Liver pathology was amyloid in 1 patient and hepatitis C in the remaining 4. Mean Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score was 17 (\u00b1 5), and mean Childs-Pugh score was 8 (\u00b1 1). Survival, now at a mean of 38 (\u00b1 20) months remains 100%, with no cardiac or hepatic graft dysfunction or episodes of rejection.

In this article, we discuss the default behavior of current software and propose some simple methods for dealing with such ties. A simulation study shows that the default behavior of current software can lead to biased estimates of the coefficient of a binary time-varying covariate and that two proposed methods (Random Jitter and Equally Weighted) reduce estimation bias. The proposed methods can be easily implemented with existing software.

Enormous progress has been made in paediatric heart transplantation since the first unsuccessful effort by Kantrowitz in 1967. Early reports of children undergoing heart transplantation showed alarmingly high perioperative mortality rates of 25-60%, with the diagnosis of congenital heart disease (CHD) representing a particularly high-risk subset compared with cardiomyopathy. Many of these early failures were related to poor patient selection, suboptimal immunosuppression and technical problems. We learned a great deal from these earlier difficulties. Presently, with more refined techniques, better-defined patient selection criteria, excellent graft rejection monitoring and optimal immunosuppression, the ISHLT 2011 registry reported a 10-year survival rate of 60% for patients transplanted for end-stage CHD and >70% for those transplanted for cardiomyopathy. The technical dilemmas in complex CHD were overcome by surgical ingenuity and creativity, innovative solutions and careful surgical planning, adapting the complex recipient anatomy to the normal donor anatomy. The miniaturized Berlin Heart pulsatile ventricular assist devices in children as a bridge to transplantation have revolutionized treatment and become a significant contribution in heart-failure therapy. The intramyocardial electrogram and echocardiographic strain rate imaging have been employed as non-invasive techniques of rejection monitoring. Immunosuppressive drugs have a major impact on the development and progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy, the main cause of cardiac allograft loss and a leading cause of mortality after the first year post-transplantation. The questions of whether a transplanted heart in a newborn grows to adult size along with the child and whether the dimensional cardiac growth allows adequate function over time have been largely answered in our previous investigations. As more transplanted children reach adulthood, concerns about their life expectancy when they have reached 10 years of life post-transplant are raised, particularly with respect to establishing partnerships and families, their ability to earn a living and the fulfilment of personal life perspectives. Some heart-transplanted patients require retransplantation to remain alive. The disparity between the demand for and supply of donor hearts makes retransplantation an ethical issue. We 'do not refuse' any patient who needs retransplantation. Mechanical circulatory support devices for long-term use are now largely available to accommodate such cases.

Cardiac retransplantation remains the most viable option for patients with allograft heart failure; however, careful patient selection is paramount considering limited allograft resources. We analyzed clinical outcomes following retransplantation in an academic, tertiary care institution. Between 1981 and 2011, 593 heart transplantations, including 22 retransplantations were performed at our institution. We analyzed the preoperative demographic characteristics, cause of allograft loss, short- and long-term surgical outcomes and cause of death among patients who had cardiac retransplantations. Twenty-two patients underwent retransplantation: 10 for graft vascular disease, 7 for acute rejection and 5 for primary graft failure. Mean age at retransplantation was 43 (standard deviation [SD] 15) years; 6 patients were women. Thirteen patients were critically ill preoperatively, requiring inotropes and/or mechanical support. The median interval between primary and retransplantation was 2.2 (range 0-16) years. Thirty-day mortality was 31.8%, and conditional (> 30 d) 1-, 5- and 10-year survival after retransplantation were 93%, 79% and 59%, respectively. A diagnosis of allograft vasculopathy (p = 0.008) and an interval between primary and retransplantation greater than 1 year (p = 0.016) had a significantly favourable impact on 30-day mortality. The median and mean survival after retransplantation were 3.3 and 5 (SD 6, range 0-18) years, respectively; graft vascular disease and multiorgan failure were the most common causes of death. Long-term outcomes for primary and retransplantation are similar if patients survive the 30-day postoperative period. Retransplantation within 1 year of the primary transplantation resulted in a high perioperative mortality and thus may be a contraindication to retransplantation.

With an increasing population of cancer survivors, it is imperative to understand the treatment options available and outcomes for chemotherapy-related cardiomyopathy. Anthracycline-based chemotherapy causes heart failure in approximately 5% of patients. Orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) is an option for cancer survivors in complete remission who develop end-stage heart failure. We examined retrospective OHT data collected from the United Network of Organ Sharing from 1987 to 2011. The primary aim was to characterize the survival in patients with either the primary diagnosis of \"dilated cardiomyopathy: Adriamycin\" (DCA) versus \"all other\" causes of cardiomyopathy. The secondary aim was to define the differences in the primary cause of death and to describe the temporal relationship of DCA OHT. The United Network of Organ Sharing database identified 453 OHTs for the diagnosis of DCA and 51,312 OHTs for all other causes of cardiomyopathy. The DCA group was significantly younger with a greater percentage of women. After adjusting for age, gender, and history of malignancy, the 10-year survival curves showed that patients with DCA have an improved survival compared to those with all other causes of cardiomyopathy (hazard ratio 1.28, p\u00a0= 0.026). No difference was found in the primary cause of death between the 2 groups. A\u00a0statistically significant increasing temporal trend was seen in the number of OHTs for the diagnosis DCA. In conclusion, patients who undergo OHT for DCA have favorable 10-year survival, making OHT a good therapeutic option for end-stage heart failure due to anthracyclines. Additionally, no increased risk of cancer-related deaths was found in the DCA group, demonstrating that recurrent malignancy does not affect long-term survival. The temporal trends demonstrated that DCA remains a significant problem for cancer survivors.

Although current left ventricular assist device (LVAD) technology has proven more durable than first-generation devices, all mechanical devices are prone to complications that can elevate patient acuity before transplantation. LVAD patients with complications intuitively carry a higher risk profile than other status 1A LVAD patients who are generally stable and use their 30 days of clinically stable status 1A time. We sought to determine if the presence or absence of complications in status 1A LVAD patients at the time of transplant influenced survival after transplant. The United Network of Organ Sharing database was retrospectively analyzed for 15,253 patients who were listed status 1A from 1998 to 2008. Survival after transplant survival was compared between patients who were and were not listed for LVAD-related complications. Standard statistical analysis was applied. No survival difference was identified at 1 and 10 years after transplant in patients who had device complications compared with those without complications. Of the five complication entries (thromboembolism, infection, malfunction, malignant arrhythmia, and other), only device infection increased mortality risk compared with noncomplicated patients (39% at 1 year, 30% at 10 years, p < 0.01). Long-term outcomes are generally not affected by the status 1A listing criteria for patients bridged to transplant with LVADs.

Orthotopic heart transplantation is the standard of care for end-stage heart disease. Left ventricular assist device implantation offers an alternative treatment approach. Left ventricular assist device practice has changed dramatically since the 2008 Food and Drug Administration approval of the HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, Calif), but at what societal cost? The present study examined the cost and efficacy of both treatments over time. All patients who underwent either orthotopic heart transplantation (n = 9369) or placement of an implantable left ventricular assist device (n = 6414) from 2005 to 2009 in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample were selected. The trends in treatment use, mortality, and cost were analyzed. The incidence of orthotopic heart transplantation increased marginally within a 5-year period. In contrast, the annual left ventricular assist device implantation rates nearly tripled. In-hospital mortality from left ventricular assist device implantation decreased precipitously, from 42% to 17%. In-hospital mortality for orthotopic heart transplantation remained relatively stable (range, 3.8%-6.5%). The mean cost per patient increased for both orthotopic heart transplantation and left ventricular assist device placement (40% and 17%, respectively). With the observed increase in both device usage and cost per patient, the cumulative Left ventricular assist device cost increased 232% within 5 years (from $143 million to $479 million). By 2009, Medicare and Medicaid were the primary payers for nearly one half of all patients (orthotopic heart transplantation, 45%; left ventricular assist device, 51%). Since Food and Drug Administration approval of the HeartMate II, mortality after left ventricular assist device implantation has decreased rapidly, yet has remained greater than that after orthotopic heart transplantation. The left ventricular assist device costs have continued to increase and have been significantly greater than those for orthotopic heart transplantation. Because of the evolving healthcare economics climate, with increasing emphasis on the costs and comparative effectiveness, a concerted effort at LVAD cost containment and judicious usage is essential to preserve the viability of this invaluable treatment.

Heart transplantation is a lifesaving procedure for patients with end-stage heart failure. Despite much effort and advances in the field, current immunosuppressive regimens are still associated with poor long-term cardiac allograft outcomes, and with the development of complications, including infections and malignancies, as well. The development of a novel, short-term, and effective immunomodulatory protocol will thus be an important achievement. The purine ATP, released during cell damage/activation, is sensed by the ionotropic purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R) on lymphocytes and regulates T-cell activation. Novel clinical-grade P2X7R inhibitors are available, rendering the targeting of P2X7R a potential therapy in cardiac transplantation. We analyzed P2X7R expression in patients and mice and P2X7R targeting in murine recipients in the context of cardiac transplantation. Our data demonstrate that P2X7R is specifically upregulated in graft-infiltrating lymphocytes in cardiac-transplanted humans and mice. Short-term P2X7R targeting with periodate-oxidized ATP promotes long-term cardiac transplant survival in 80% of murine recipients of a fully mismatched allograft. Long-term survival of cardiac transplants was associated with reduced T-cell activation, T-helper cell 1/T-helper cell 17 differentiation, and inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation in T cells, thus leading to a reduced transplant infiltrate and coronaropathy. In vitro genetic upregulation of the P2X7R pathway was also shown to stimulate T-helper cell 1/T-helper cell 17 cell generation. Finally, P2X7R targeting halted the progression of coronaropathy in a murine model of chronic rejection as well. P2X7R targeting is a novel clinically relevant strategy to prolong cardiac transplant survival.

The mean duration of left ventricular assist device support did not change in patients who had received a left ventricular assist device in the early period of the study (2005-2008, n = 62) compared with those who had received a left ventricular assist device later (2009-2011, n = 78, 373 vs 392 days, P = NS). In addition, no difference was seen in survival between those patients supported with a left ventricular assist device for fewer than 180 days or longer than 180 days before transplantation (P = NS). The actuarial survival after transplantation at 30 days and 1, 3, and 5 years by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 98.7%, 93.0%, 91.1%, and 88.0%, respectively. The short- and long-term post-transplant survival for patients bridged with a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device in the current era has been excellent. Furthermore, the duration of left ventricular assist device support did not affect post-transplant survival.

Elevated heart rate (HR) is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcome in the general population and in patients with cardiovascular disease. Elevated HR due to graft denervation is often found in heart transplantation (HTx) patients; the effect on graft survival and vasculopathy is unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of elevated HR at 12 months post-HTx and its power to predict HTx long-term outcome. We evaluated retrospectively a prospective database of 312 patients undergoing HTx at two centers. HR was registered at 12 months post-HTx. The median HR was used as a cutoff point. Cox regression analysis was performed with variables known to be clinically relevant to mortality and those selected from the univariate analysis. During a mean follow-up of 5.5 \u00b1 2.8 years there were 58 deaths (19%). Patients with a HR \u2265 90 bpm (median HR) at 12 months had an increased risk for all-cause mortality (Hazard Ratio=2.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.5, p=0.009) and mortality related to coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) (Hazard Ratio=3.0, 95% CI 1.25-7.14, p=0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that a HR \u2265 90 bpm independently predicted mortality (HR 3.2, 95% CI 1.4-7.1, p=0.004). Elevated HR measured at 12 months after HTx is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in HTx recipients.

The outcomes of emergency cardiac transplantation remain controversial, but recipient selection is essential for success. With a shortage of organs, it is essential to determine an objective method, such as a risk score, for choosing patients who are at too great a risk to undergo cardiac transplantation. In this study, we analysed the model for end-stage liver disease in terms of predicting operative mortality after emergency cardiac transplantation. We analysed the Nancy University database of heart transplantation and selected all patients who underwent emergency heart transplantation between January 2005 and January 2012. The calibration and discriminatory power were evaluated to determine the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. Preoperative and peri-operative variables regarding the prediction of operative mortality were analysed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Forty-three patients underwent emergency cardiac transplantation. The operative mortality was 20.9% (n = 9). The Hosmer-Lemeshow test demonstrated a calibrated model for predicting operative mortality (P = 0.15), and the MELD score presented an excellent discrimination between survivors and non-survivors (AUC: 0.89 \u00b1 0.05; 95% CI: 0.79-0.99). In the univariate analysis, an MELD score of \u2265 16 and bilirubin concentration were predictive markers of operative mortality. Multivariate logistic regression tested the contribution of the univariate risk predictors (P < 0.15) and confirmed that an MELD score of \u2265 16 was predictive of operative mortality. The MELD score appears to be adequate for predicting operative mortality among patients who undergo heart transplantation.

We studied a cohort of 1872 potential organ donors managed by the California Transplant Donor Network from 2001 to 2008. Forty-five percent of available allografts were accepted for heart transplantation. Donor predictors of allograft nonuse included age >50 years, female sex, death attributable to cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, a positive troponin assay, left-ventricular dysfunction and regional wall motion abnormalities, and left-ventricular hypertrophy. For hearts that were transplanted, only donor cause of death was associated with prolonged recipient hospitalization post-transplant, and only donor diabetes mellitus was predictive of increased recipient mortality. Whereas there are many donor predictors of allograft discard in the current era, these characteristics seem to have little effect on recipient outcomes when the hearts are transplanted.

We further investigated the therapeutic effect of a targeted complement inhibitor in recipients of BD donor hearts and addressed the clinical relevance of these studies by analyzing human heart biopsies from BD and domino (living) donors. Hearts from living or BD donor C57BL/6 mice were transplanted into C57BL/6 or BALB/c recipients. Recipient mice were treated with the complement inhibitor CR2-Crry or vehicle control (n=6).

Human cardiac biopsies were analyzed for complement deposition and inflammatory cell infiltration. In the murine model, donor BD exacerbated ischemia/reperfusion injury and graft rejection, as demonstrated by increased myocardial injury, serum cardiac troponin, cellular infiltration, complement deposition, inflammatory chemokine and cytokine levels, and by decreased graft survival. CR2-Crry treatment of recipients significantly reduced all measured outcomes in grafts from both BD and living donors compared with controls. Analysis of human samples documented the relevance of our experimental findings and revealed exacerbated complement deposition and inflammation in grafts from BD donors compared with grafts from living donors.

Children who developed malignancy in group I had similar survival as children who developed malignancy in group II. Post-transplant survival is similar in children with and without pretransplant malignancy in spite of higher rate of malignancy in children with pretransplant malignancy.

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are associated with increased morbidity. Children receiving heart transplants constitute a unique group of patients due to their risk factors. Although previous studies in nontransplant patients have focused primarily on the effects of postoperative blood transfusions, a significant exposure to blood occurs during the intraoperative period, and a larger percentage of heart transplant patients require intraoperative blood transfusions when compared with general cardiac surgery patients. We investigated the relationship between clinical outcomes and the amount of blood transfused both during and after heart transplantation. We hypothesized that larger amounts of RBC transfusions are associated with worsening clinical outcomes in pediatric heart transplant patients. A database comprising 108 pediatric patients undergoing heart transplantation from 2004 to 2010 was queried. Preoperative and postoperative clinical risk factors, including the amount of blood transfused intraoperatively and 48 hours postoperatively, were analyzed. The outcome measures were length of hospital stay, duration of tracheal intubation, inotrope score, and major adverse events. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to control for simultaneous risk factors and determine outcomes in which the amount of blood transfused was an independent risk factor. Ninety-four patients with complete datasets were included in the final analysis. Eighty-eight percent received RBC transfusions, with a median transfusion amount of 38.7 mL/kg. A multivariate analysis correcting for 8 covariate risk factors, including the Index for Mortality Prediction After Cardiac Transplantation, age, weight, United Network for Organ Sharing status, warm and cold ischemia time, repeat sternotomy, and pretransplant hematocrit, showed RBC transfusions were independently associated with increased length of intensive care unit stay (means ratio = 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.76; P = 0.03), and increased inotrope score in the first postoperative 24 hour (mean ratio = 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.52; P = 0.04). Patients suffering major adverse events received significantly larger median amounts of blood RBC transfusions (P = 0.002). Transfusions >60 mL/kg were also associated with increased risk of major adverse events (accuracy 76%) including postoperative sepsis, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, open chest, dialysis, and graft failure.

A best evidence topic was constructed according to a structured protocol. The following question was addressed: of the following two procedures, heart\u2013lung transplantation or bilateral-lung transplantation (BLTx), which offers the best outcome for patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) listed for thoracic transplantation? Of the 77 papers found using a report search for PH and thoracic transplantation, 9 represented the best evidence to answer this clinical question. Overall, 1189 (67%) lung transplantations and 578 (33%) heart\u2013lung transplantations have been reported worldwide for idiopathic PH. For patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome, HLTx represents up to 70% of the transplantation procedures they undergo. On the whole, neither procedure demonstrated an overall survival benefit, when compared with the other. However, PH patients represent a heterogeneous population according to (i) the primary mechanism of PH and (ii) the consequences of PH on right or/and left heart function. With regard to the latter consideration, the current evidence shows that HLTx offers excellent functional and survival outcomes for patients with congenital heart disease and Eisenmenger's syndrome, severe right or/and left heart dysfunction, and who are chronically inotropic dependent. As far as heart dysfunction is concerned, the published evidence approximated cut-off values at 10\u201325% for the right ventricle ejection fraction (RVEF) and at 32\u201355% for the left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF). In the case of lower values for RVEF and LVEF, HLTx should be performed. In all other patients with PH, the evidence demonstrated that BLTx offers a comparable outcome with the advantage of better organ sharing for other recipients.

CD160 is a cell surface molecule expressed by most NK cells and approximately 50% of CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Engagement of CD160 by MHC class-I directly triggers a costimulatory signal to TCR-induced proliferation, cytokine production and cytotoxic effector functions. The role of CD160 in alloimmunity is unknown. Using a newly generated CD160 fusion protein (CD160Ig) we examined the role of the novel costimulatory molecule CD160 in mediating CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cell driven allograft rejection. CD160Ig inhibits alloreactive CD8(+) T cell proliferation and IFN-\u03b3 production in vitro, in particular in the absence of CD28 costimulation. Consequently CD160Ig prolongs fully mismatched cardiac allograft survival in CD4(-/-), CD28(-/-) knockout and CTLA4Ig treated WT recipients, but not in WT or CD8(-/-) knockout recipients. The prolonged cardiac allograft survival is associated with reduced alloreactive CD8(+) T cell proliferation, effector/memory responses and alloreactive IFN-\u03b3 production. Thus, CD160 signaling is particularly important in CD28-independent effector/memory CD8(+) alloreactive T cell activation in vivo and therefore may serve as a novel target for prevention of allograft rejection.

Chronic heart transplant rejection, i.e. cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a major adverse prognostic factor after heart transplantation (HTx).

Forty-five HTx patients underwent a total of 50 quantitative IVUS measurements for intima thickness assessment (>1 mm = severe CAV; the reference method). Simultaneously, the two factors constituting myocardial perfusion (mL/min/g) were obtained by transthoracic contrast echocardiography at rest: rBV (the test method), a measure of microvascular density (mL/mL), and its exchange rate \u03b2 (1/s; a measure of coronary conductance) after mechanical contrast bubble disruption.Sixty-nine per cent (31 of 45) of the HTx patients showed severe CAV. rBV at rest was equal to 0.17 \u00b1 0.05 in the group without severe CAV, and it was equal to 0.12 \u00b1 0.07 in the group with severe CAV (P = 0.0157). Conversely, \u03b2 amounted to 6.4 \u00b1 4.5 in the former and to 10.3 \u00b1 6.2 in the latter group (P = 0.0410), thus, maintaining normal resting myocardial perfusion at 1 mL/min/g.

Regions with more transplant centers (p < 0.0001) and fewer transplants (p = 0.0015) had higher waitlist mortality. Risk-adjusted individual waitlist mortality varied from 6.9% (R1, CI 6.2-7.8) to 19.2% (R5, CI 18.0-20.6).

Simultaneous thoracic and abdominal (STA) transplantation is controversial because two organs are allocated to a single individual. We studied wait-list urgency, and whether transplantation led to successful outcomes. Candidates and recipients for heart-kidney (SHK), heart-liver (SHLi), lung-liver (SLuLi) and lung-kidney (SLuK) were identified through the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and outcomes were compared to single-organ transplantation. Since 1987, there were 1801 STA candidates and 836 recipients. Wait-list survival at 1- and 3 years for SHK (67.4%, 40.8%; N = 1420), SHLi (65.7%, 43.6%; N = 218) and SLuLi (65.7%, 41.0%; N = 122), was lower than controls (p < 0.001), whereas for SLuK (65.0%, 51.6%; N = 41) it was comparable (p = 0.34). All STA groups demonstrated similar 1- and 5 years posttransplant survival to thoracic controls. Compared to abdominal controls, 1- and 5 years posttransplant survival in SHK (85.3%, 74.0%; N = 684), SLuLi (75.5%, 59.0%; N= 42) and SLuK (66.7%, 55.6%; N = 18) was decreased (p < 0.01), but SHLi (85.9%, 74.3%; N = 92) was comparable (p = 0.81). In summary, STA candidates had greater risk of wait-list mortality compared to single-organ candidates. STA outcomes were similar to thoracic transplantation; however, outcomes were similar to abdominal transplantation for SHLi only. Although select patients benefit from STA, risk-exposure variables for decreased survival should be identified, aiming to eliminate futile transplantation.

Today, a main focus of the transplant community is the long-term outcomes of lung and heart allograft recipients. However, even early post-transplant survival (within the first post-transplant year) needs improvement, as early graft failure still accounts for many allograft losses. In this chapter, we review the experience of heart and lung transplantation as reported to the Organ Procurement Transplant Network/United Network of Organ Sharing registry and investigate the factors responsible for causing failure in the first post-transplant year. Trends indicate that sicker patients are increasingly being transplanted, thereby limiting improvements in early post-transplant survival. More lung and heart transplant patients are coming to transplant on dialysis. In heart transplant, there is an increase in the number of heart retransplant patients and an increase in patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. For lung transplant, more patients are on a ventilator prior to transplant than in the past 25 years. Given that sicker/riskier patients are now receiving more heart and lung transplants, future studies need to take place to better understand these patients so that they can have the same survival as patients entering transplant with less severe illnesses.

Three of 19 patients (16%) experienced recurrence of extracardiac sarcoid, with no mortality. Patients with cardiac sarcoidosis undergoing heart transplantation have acceptable long-term outcomes without evidence of recurrence of sarcoidosis in the allograft when maintained on low-dose corticosteroids.

Heart procurement for orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) is limited by the conventional 4 hours of ischemic time (IT). Based on a recent report from our center showing that extended IT from a young donor group is safe, we widened our geographical reach, resulting in almost 40% of our transplants having an IT > 4 hours. We retrospectively reviewed records of adult patients who underwent OHT from January 2006 to December 2011. The primary outcome was survival, and secondary outcomes included resource utilization, end-organ dysfunction, and acute cellular rejection. Overall survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. Secondary outcomes were compared with a combination of parametric and nonparametric statistics. A total of 323 patients underwent OHT. There was a significant difference in overall survival between the standard and extended IT groups (85.7% vs 76.4%, P\u00a0= .03). There were no significant differences between the groups for secondary outcomes except a higher incidence of liver dysfunction in the extended IT group (84.9% vs 73%, P\u00a0= .01). Further analysis revealed that mortality remains similar if IT is below 4 hours and between 4 and 5 hours, but begins to climb after 5 hours, driving the difference between our standard and extended IT.

Immunologic incompatibility has implications for primary graft failure, rejection, and survival in\u00a0heart transplantation. To our knowledge, this is the first large cohort study investigating the impact of ABO-compatible versus identical blood type matching on post heart transplantation survival. We used a nationwide sample (2000-2010) within the United Network for Organ Sharing database. Stratification was between ABO-identical and ABO-compatible heart transplantations for univariate and multivariate analyses. The primary end point was graft failure from all causes. Posttransplant survival was compared between groups using Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression models. A total of 17,951 patients met inclusion criteria, and 2684 (approximately 15%) underwent ABO-compatible heart transplantation. ABO-compatible recipients were generally sicker than ABO-identical recipients before transplant because more were status 1A, in the intensive care unit, and receiving mechanical ventilatory support (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Univariate analysis correlated ABO-compatible transplants with decreased posttransplant survival and a higher incidence of primary graft failure as cause of death (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). There was no significant difference in acute graft rejection (P\u00a0=\u00a0.53). Multivariate analysis, however, did not demonstrate adverse outcomes in terms of decreased graft survival (hazard ratio, 0.99; P\u00a0=\u00a0.87). Blood type O donor grafts were associated with poorer outcomes compared with all other types (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05).

Recommendations based on a systematic review. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are used in chronic end-stage heart failure as \"bridge to transplantation\" (BTT) and, more recently, for transplant-ineligible patients as \"destination therapy\" (DT). We reviewed the evidence on clinical effects and cost-effectiveness of 2 types of continuous-flow LVADs (HeartMate II [HM II] and HeartWare), for BTT and DT patients. We systematically searched the scientific literature (January 2008-June 2012) and identified 14 clinical studies (approximately 2900 HM II and approximately 200 HeartWare patients), and 3 economic evaluations (HM II) using simulation models. Data were, however, limited to 2-3 studies per outcome. We made policy recommendations on the basis of our systematic review. Although complications after implantation are frequent, LVAD therapy is often highly effective across transplantation eligibility status and device, with 1-year survival reaching 86% for BTT and 78% for DT (compared with 25% for medical therapy). Neither BTT nor DT currently meet traditional cost-effectiveness limits in models using historical data, although BTT is standard practice for a limited number of patients in many regions. We found that BTT and DT as implantation strategies tend to be no longer mutually exclusive. We conclude that evidence is sufficient to support LVAD use, regardless of transplantation eligibility status, as long as patients are carefully selected and program infrastructure and budget are adequate.

The success rate in \"early\" graft failures was 51.4% (18/35) and 50% for \"late\" graft failure. The ischemic time with graft failure (178 \u00b1 70 min) was significantly longer than that without graft failure. Preoperative status and the longer ischemic time may be the major factors for failure. Long-term 5-year survival demonstrated significant survival difference between graft failure and nongraft failure. No survival difference was shown between \"early\" and \"late\" graft failure. Graft failure still carried high mortality if advanced circulatory support was required. Early graft failure and late graft failure had similar outcomes. Further investigation of the risk factors shows that ECMO does play a role of rescue in catastrophic conditions.

The accuracy of various risk models to predict early post-transplant mortality is limited by the type, quality, and era of the data collected. Most models incorporate a large number of recipient-derived and donor-derived variables; however, other factors related to specific institutional practices likely influence early mortality. The goal of this study was to determine if the addition of institutional practice variables would improve the predictive accuracy of a recipient/donor risk model in a modern cohort of heart transplant recipients. Between 1999 and 2007, 3,591 primary heart transplants were performed at the 26 institutions participating in the Cardiac Transplant Research Database. Multivariable regression analysis in the hazard domain was used to identify recipient, donor, and institutional practice variables that were predictive of 1-year mortality. The derived model was used to predict institutional outcomes and compare them with observed outcomes first without and then with the inclusion of the institutional practice variables. Eleven individual plus 2 interaction recipient variables and 2 individual plus 2 interaction donor variables were predictive of increased mortality. The addition of institutional practice variables to the model identified 4 variables associated with decreased mortality: greater number of transplant cardiologists, a thoracic surgery fellowship, a surgery or cardiology attending taking donor call, and routine surveillance for antibody-mediated rejection. By using a p-value > 0.10 as a robust measure of similarity, the addition of institutional practice variables increased the number of institutions with similar predicted vs. observed mortality from 18 of 26 institutions (69%) to 26 of 26 (100%), demonstrating improved predictive accuracy of the model. Multiple recipient and donor variables influence early survival but do not fully explain the difference in predicted and observed outcomes at the institutional level.

Eight hundred and twenty-seven heart transplants were performed from 1981 to 1993, and among these, 131 (16%) patients survived \u2265 20 years; 98 (75%) were male and mean age at transplant was 43 \u00b1 13 years. Conditional survival in these 20 years survivors was 74.1 \u00b1 4.3% at 23 years and 60.9 \u00b1 5.3% at 25 years (45 deaths, 34%). Forty-four (34%) patients suffered rejection \u2265 2R. Conditional survival free from rejection \u2265 2R was 68 \u00b1 4.1% at 5 years and 66.4 \u00b1 4.2% at 10 years. Thirty-five (27%) patients had cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) grade 2-3. Conditional CAV-free survival was 76 \u00b1 3.8% at 20 years and 72.1 \u00b1 4% at 25. Sixty-nine (53%) patients developed malignancy, mostly skin cancers. Conditional malignancy-free survival was 53.5 \u00b1 4.4% at 20 years and 45.2 \u00b1 4.6% at 25 years. At latest follow-up, 24.0 \u00b1 3.0 years after transplantation, mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 62 \u00b1 11% and mean physical and mental scores were 57 \u00b1 23 and 58 \u00b1 21, respectively.

This study evaluated whether worsened outcomes in sex mismatch are related to mismatch of organ size in heart transplantation. Sizing for organ allocation in heart transplantation currently incorporates only body weight differences between the donor and recipient. Weight correlates poorly to cardiac size, and donor\u2013recipient weight differences are not associated with differential survival. Heart size correlates with sex, and donor\u2013recipient sex mismatch conveys worse-than-expected outcomes. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 31,634 donor\u2013recipient adult heart transplant pairings from the United Network for Organ Sharing transplantation registry. We used predictive models to calculate the predicted total heart mass (pHM) for recipient and donor pairs. We assessed organ size mismatch by calculating the percent difference between the donor and recipient pHM as [(pHM(recipient) \u2013 pHM(donor))/(pHM(recipient))]*100. The most-undersized pHM septile demonstrated higher mortality during the first year post-transplantation (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.27; p < 0.001), which remained robust in adjusted models (HR: 1.25; p = 0.03). Survival did not vary across septiles of weight differences. On univariate analysis, sex mismatch was associated with higher mortality in male patients, but not in female patients. Controlling for differences in pHM reversed these associations. Adjusted models demonstrated worse survival associated with sex mismatch in female patients (1-year HR: 1.28; p = 0.02) but no difference in male patients (1-year HR, 1.00; p = 1.0). Differences in donor\u2013recipient pHM modulated the survival associated with donor\u2013recipient sex mismatch and identified donor heart undersizing as an otherwise occult and potentially preventable cause of mortality following orthotopic heart transplantation.

The aim of our study was to identify preoperative risk factors affecting overall survival after cardiac retransplantation (ReTX) in a contemporary era. The United Network for Organ Sharing database was used to identify patients undergoing ReTX between 1995 and 2012. Of the total 28,464 primary transplants performed, 987 (3.5%) were retransplants. The primary outcome investigated was overall survival. The influence of preoperative donor and recipient characteristics on survival were then tested with univariate logistic regression and multivariate Cox regression models. Of 987 patients who underwent ReTX, median survival was 9 years. Estimated survival at 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 years following retransplant was 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78%-83%), 70% (95% CI, 67%-73%), 64% (95% CI, 61%-67%), 47% (95% CI, 43%-51%), and 30% (95% CI, 25%-37%), respectively. Clinical predictors of survival using multivariable analysis included donor age (relative risk [RR], 1.14; P = .004), ischemic time > 4 hours (RR, 1.48; P = .004); preoperative support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (RR, 3.91; P < .001), and the time between previous and current transplant (P = .004). Patients with ReTX have 1.27 times higher relative risk of death compared with patients undergoing primary transplant only (RR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.13-1.42; P < .001). Patients who undergo cardiac ReTX can expect to have a 1-year survival less than a patient undergoing primary transplant with an acceptable median overall survival. Both donor and recipient preoperative factors contribute to overall survival following cardiac ReTx. Donor characteristics include age of the donor and ischemic time. Recipient factors include the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenator and the number of days between the first and second transplant. Optimal survival following cardiac ReTX can best be predicted by choosing patients who are farther out from their initial transplant, not dependent upon preoperative extracorporeal support, and by choosing donor hearts younger in age and those likely to have shorter ischemic times.

Gene expression profiling test scores have primarily been used to identify heart transplant recipients who have a low probability of rejection at the time of surveillance testing. We hypothesized that the variability of gene expression profiling test scores within a patient may predict risk of future events of allograft dysfunction or death. Patients from the IMAGE study with rejection surveillance gene expression profiling tests performed at 1- to 6-month intervals were selected for this cohort study. Gene expression profiling score variability was defined as the standard deviation of an individual's cumulative test scores. Gene expression profiling ordinal score (range, 0-39), threshold score (binary value=1 if ordinal score \u2265 34), and score variability were studied in multivariate Cox regression models to predict future clinical events. Race, age at time of transplantation, and time posttransplantation were significantly associated with future events in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analyses, gene expression profiling score variability, but not ordinal scores or scores over threshold, was independently associated with future clinical events. The regression coefficient P values were <0.001, 0.46, and 0.773, for gene expression profiling variability, ordinal, and threshold scores, respectively. The hazard ratio for a 1 unit increase in variability was 1.76 (95% CI, 1.4-2.3). The variability of a heart recipient's gene expression profiling test scores over time may provide prognostic utility. This information is independent of the probability of acute cellular rejection at the time of testing that is rendered from a single ordinal gene-expression profiling test score.

This study evaluated changes in physical functional performance after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) with particular attention to the impact of recipient age on functional outcomes. Retrospective review of all first-time, single-organ adult OHTs in the United States between 2005 and 2010. Patients were primarily stratified by age. The validated Karnofsky performance scale, which ranges from 0 (death) to 100 (fully independent with no evidence of disease and no complaints), was used to measure functional status. A total of 10,049 OHT recipients were identified, with 1,431 (14%) aged 65 years or greater. Mean Karnofsky score prior to OHT was comparable between cohorts (younger: 50.7\u00b125.2 versus older: 50.1\u00b125.0; p=0.38). At a median follow-up of 2.1 years (interquartile range 0.7 to 3.3 years), 64% of OHT recipients had improved functional performance. The mean improvement in Karnofsky score was similar between younger and older patients (19.6\u00b142.0 vs 17.5\u00b141.8; p=0.10). Twenty percent of younger patients were functionally independent prior to OHT, with 67% being functionally independent at last follow-up (p<0.001). Similarly, in the older cohort, 20% were functionally independent prior to OHT, with 66% being functionally independent at last follow-up (p<0.001). Multivariable analysis adjusting for potential confounders confirmed that age, both as a continuous and categoric variable, did not impact odds of functional improvement after OHT. Subanalysis using 70 years as the age cutoff produced similar results. In the modern era, OHT is associated with improvements in functional performance in most recipients, and this beneficial effect is preserved across the age spectrum. These data provide a benchmark for functional outcomes after OHT and may have important implications in organ allocation.

Although primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is fairly common early after cardiac transplant, standardized schemes for diagnosis and treatment remain contentious. Most major cardiac transplant centers use different definitions and parameters of cardiac function. Thus, there is difficulty comparing published reports and no agreed protocol for management. A consensus conference was organized to better define, diagnose, and manage PGD. There were 71 participants (transplant cardiologists, surgeons, immunologists and pathologists), with vast clinical and published experience in PGD, representing 42 heart transplant centers worldwide. State-of-the-art PGD presentations occurred with subsequent breakout sessions planned in an attempt to reach consensus on various issues. Graft dysfunction will be classified into primary graft dysfunction (PGD) or secondary graft dysfunction where there is a discernible cause such as hyperacute rejection, pulmonary hypertension, or surgical complications. PGD must be diagnosed within 24 hours of completion of surgery. PGD is divided into PGD-left ventricle and PGD-right ventricle. PGD-left ventricle is categorized into mild, moderate, or severe grades depending on the level of cardiac function and the extent of inotrope and mechanical support required. Agreed risk factors for PGD include donor, recipient, and surgical procedural factors. Recommended management involves minimization of risk factors, gradual increase of inotropes, and use of mechanical circulatory support as needed. Retransplantation may be indicated if risk factors are minimal. With a standardized definition of PGD, there will be more consistent recognition of this phenomenon and treatment modalities will be more comparable. This should lead to better understanding of PGD and prevention/minimization of its adverse outcomes.

The study included all AA patients who have received a heart transplant in our center since 1983. Stepwise Cox regression was used for covariates affecting the survival. The \u03c7(2) test was employed to identify the effects of a mechanical assist device and pretransplant creatinine (Cr) on the outcomes in AA and non-AA patients. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to examine survival. The average survival among AA recipients was 5.4\u2009years, compared with 12 years for the non-AA recipients, with 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates of 80%, 55%, and 25%, respectively. This was found to be statistically inferior to the survival probabilities of 92%, 78%, and 58% for the non-AA group (P < 0.005).

This study examined the impact of the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) policy changes for regional differences in waitlist time and mortality before and after heart transplantation. The 2006 UNOS thoracic organ allocation policy change was implemented to allow for greater regional sharing of organs for heart transplantation. We analyzed 36,789 patients who were listed for heart transplantation from January 1999 through April 2012. These patients were separated into 2 eras centered on the July 12, 2006 UNOS policy change.

Fifty-seven studies met the eligibility criteria. 34 studies had graft rejection as outcome, with 26 of the studies reporting a significant reduction in graft rejection with increasing degree of HLA matching. Thirteen of 18 articles that reported on graft failure found that it decreased significantly with increasing HLA match.

The risk of cancer transmission from donors characterized as high or unacceptable risk was studied by analysing transplant and cancer registry data. Donors and recipients from England (1990-2008) were identified from the UK Transplant Registry. Cancer details were obtained from cancer registries and classified using guidelines from the Council of Europe and Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing. Of 17,639 donors, 202 (1.1 per cent) had a history of cancer, including 61 donors with cancers classed as having an unacceptable/high risk of transmission. No cancer transmission was noted in 133 recipients of organs from these 61 donors. At 10 years after transplantation, the additional survival benefit gained by transplanting organs from donors with unacceptable/high-risk cancer was 944 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 851 to 1037) life-years, with a mean survival of 7.1 (95 per cent c.i. 6.4 to 7.8) years per recipient.

The number of heart-transplant recipients exceeding 20 years of follow-up is steadily increasing. However, little is known about their functional status, comorbidities, and mortality. Identifying the predictors of prolonged survival could guide the selection of candidates for the low number of available donors. Functional status, morbidities, and mortality of heart-transplant patients between 1984 and 1992 were analyzed. To identify predictors of 20-year survival, a logistic regression model was constructed using the covariates associated with survival in the univariate analysis. A total of 39 patients who survived 20 years (26% of patients transplanted before 1992) were compared to 90 recipients from the same period who died between 1 and 20 years post-transplantation. Major complications were hypertension, renal dysfunction, infections, and cancer. After a mean follow-up of 30 months, 6 survivors had died, yielding a mortality rate of 6% per year (vs 2.5%-3% in years 1-19). Causes of mortality were infection (50%), malignancy (33%), and allograft vasculopathy (17%). Long-term survivors were younger and leaner, and had nonischemic cardiomyopathy and lower ischemic time. Logistic regression identified recipient age <45 years (odds ratio=3.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-9.7; P=.002) and idiopathic cardiomyopathy (odds ratio=3; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-7.8; P=.012) as independent predictors for 20-year survival. One fourth of all heart-transplant patients in our series survived >20 years with the same graft, and most enjoy independent lives despite significant comorbidities. Recipient age <45 years and idiopathic cardiomyopathy were associated with survival beyond 2 decades. These data may help decide donor allocation.

A total of 247 heart transplantations were performed in 2012. The whole series consisted of 6775 procedures. Recent years have seen a progressive worsening in the clinical characteristics of recipients (34% aged over 60 years, 22% with severe kidney failure, 17% with insulin-dependent diabetes, 29% with previous heart surgery, 16% under mechanical ventilation) and donors (38% aged over 45 years, 26% with recipient: donor weight mismatch>20%), and in surgical conditions (29% of procedures at >4\u00a0h ischemia and 36% as emergency transplantations). The probability of survival at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years of follow-up was 78%, 67%, 53%, and 38%, respectively. These results have remained stable since 1995. In recent years, the number of heart transplantations/year in Spain has remained stable at around 250. Despite the worsening of recipient and donor clinical characteristics and of time-to-surgery, the results in terms of mortality have remained stable and compare favorably with those of other countries.

There were no significant differences in postoperative cardiac enzymes, hemodynamic data, length of stay in intensive care, or 30-day mortality between the groups. The HTK group showed a trend of shorter pumping time (P = .091). Multivariate analyses reveal that the HTK group had higher postoperative inotropic score (P < .001) and shorter pumping time (P = .02).

Patients were randomly divided 4:1 into derivation and validation cohorts. The primary outcome was new-onset postoperative renal failure requiring dialysis. A multivariable model was created incorporating variables associated with renal failure in univariate analysis, with significant risk factors assigned points based on odds ratios. A simple guide was generated to demonstrate ranges of risk scores associated with clinically meaningful renal failure rates.

There was a high degree of correlation between actual renal failure rates in the validation cohort and predicted rates in the derivation cohort based on risk scores (r = 0.91, P < .001). Renal failure risk categories were generated on the basis of probabilities determined in the derivation cohort: low (<5% risk, score 0-15), average (5%-10% risk, score 16-26), above average (10%-20% risk, score 27-39), and high (>20% risk, score \u2265 40).

We conducted an observational study of 669 patients who underwent emergency HT in 15 Spanish hospitals between 2000 and 2009. Postoperative outcomes of patients bridged to HT on short-term MCS (n=101) were compared with those of the rest of the cohort (n=568). Short-term MCS included veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenators (VA-ECMOs, n=23), and both pulsatile-flow (n=53) and continuous-flow (n=25) extracorporeal ventricular assist devices (VADs). No patient underwent HT on intracorporeal VADs. Preoperative short-term MCS was independently associated with increased in-hospital postoperative mortality (adjusted odds-ratio 1.75, 95% CI 1.05-2.91) and overall post-transplant mortality (adjusted hazard-ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.15-2.23). Rates of major surgical bleeding, cardiac reoperation, postoperative infection and primary graft failure were also significantly higher among MCS patients. Causes of death and survival after hospital discharge were similar in MCS and non-MCS candidates. Increased risk of post-transplant mortality affected patients bridged on pulsatile-flow extracorporeal VADs (adjusted hazard-ratio 2.21, 95% CI 1.48-3.30) and continuous-flow extracorporeal VADs (adjusted hazard-ratio 2.24, 95% CI 1.20-4.19), but not those bridged on VA-ECMO (adjusted hazard-ratio 0.51, 95% CI 0.21-1.25). Patients bridged to emergency HT on short-term MCS are exposed to an increased risk of postoperative complications and mortality.

Between 1991 and 2011, 61 patients, mean age 15.0 \u00b1 9.7 years, underwent OHT for failing atriopulmonary connection (17 patients = 27.8%) or total cavopulmonary connection (44 patients = 72.2%). Modality of FF included arrhythmia (14.8%), complex obstructions in the Fontan circuit (16.4%), protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) (22.9%), impaired ventricular function (31.1%) or a combination of the above (14.8%). The mean time interval between Fontan completion and OHT was 10.7 \u00b1 6.6 years. Early FF occurred in 18%, requiring OHT 0.8 \u00b1 0.5 years after Fontan. The hospital mortality rate was 18.3%, mainly secondary to infection (36.4%) and graft failure (27.3%). The mean follow-up was 66.8 \u00b1 54.2 months.

The Kaplan-Meier 5-year survival estimate was 82.3 \u00b1 5.9% in late FF and 32.7 \u00b1 15.0% in early FF (P = 0.0007). Late FF with poor ventricular function exhibited a 91.5 \u00b1 5.8% 5-year OHT survival. PLE was cured in 77.7% of hospital survivors, but the 5-year Kaplan-Meier survival estimate in PLE was 46.3 \u00b1 14.4 vs 84.3 \u00b1 5.5% in non-PLE (P = 0.0147). Cox proportional hazards identified early FF (P = 0.0005), complex Fontan pathway obstruction (P = 0.0043) and PLE (P = 0.0033) as independent predictors of 5-year mortality.

We reviewed patients with a prenatal diagnosis of single-ventricle cardiac defects, made at one institution between 1995 and 2008. Cases diagnosed with double-inlet LV, tricuspid atresia, pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum and severe RV hypoplasia and those with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) were included in the study population. Patients with HLHS were identified prenatally as being standard risk or high risk (HLHS with highly restrictive or intact atrial septum, mitral stenosis with aortic atresia and/or LV coronary artery sinusoids). Patients with an address over 200 miles from the hospital, diagnosed with heterotaxy syndrome or referred for fetal intervention, were excluded. We identified 312 cases of single-ventricle cardiac defect (208 dominant RV; 104 dominant LV) that were diagnosed prenatally. Most (96%) patients with a dominant RV had HLHS.

Factors associated with survival beyond 1 year were assessed using multivariable proportional hazards regression analysis. Of 85,647 adults who underwent HTx, 1,851 (2.2%) were transplanted for ACHD. Early death secondary due to technical reasons was high among ACHD HTx recipients: 10% vs. 4% in controls (p < 0.0001). However, long-term survival of ACHD recipients who survived the early hazard phase was superior compared with controls (p < 0.0001). This was in part due to a lower infection (p < 0.0001) and malignancy-related (p < 0.01) mortality. Cardiac re-transplantation in ACHD HTx recipients was associated with a 2.75-fold increase in mortality. A \"survival paradox\" exists among ACHD recipients, whose high early mortality is balanced by better long-term survival in those who survive the early hazard phase after HTx. A high mortality risk after cardiac re-transplantation in this group of patients suggests that this treatment option should only be considered in carefully selected ACHD HTx recipients.

The aging of society is reflected in the United Network for Organ Sharing data, with more patients older than 70 years old receiving cardiac transplantation. The rate of acute rejection is higher in the group of younger patients, whereas older patients suffer from renal failure.

Increasing donor age raises their risk of death and graft failure by 1.8% per year of age. The long-term survival is significantly worse for the elderly, but the 1- and 5-year survival is acceptable. Therefore, heart transplantation in the elderly is still justified.

This chapter will focus on the advances of statin therapy in the management of heart transplant recipients. Statins are widely used for the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and the benefit is derived not only from lipid lowering, but also through the pleiotropic, cholesterol-independent effects, which include vasculoprotective, antiinflammatory, and immunosuppressive properties. Statin therapy administered to patients after heart transplantation results in a decrease in rejection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and an increase in short- and long-term survival.

Out of 114 consecutive patients receiving orthotopic heart transplantation between January 2006 and July 2013, 18 (15.7%) developed PGF requiring veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (VA-ECMO) support. Fourteen patients were male and the mean age was 49\u00b111 years. General principles in treating the patients were based on a low dose of adrenaline (0.05 mic/kg per min) infusion; femoral intra-aortic balloon pump (13 of the 18 patients); low dose of vasoconstrictors; careful fluid balance; daily echocardiographic transesophageal monitoring. Mean graft recipient pulmonary vascular resistance was 3.6\u00b13.2 WU. Five patients had absolute contraindication to IABP placement. The mean left ventricle ejection fraction pre-VA-ECMO was 18.4%\u00b110.2%. The mean VA-ECMO and IABP support times were 6.7\u00b13.2 and 9.2\u00b17.6 days, respectively. Mean VA-ECMO flow was 4164\u00b1679 l/min. The mean left ventricle ejection fraction increased to 43.4%\u00b117.7% at the end of support. Weaning and discharge rates in patients treated with VA-ECMO+IABP were 84% and 53%, respectively. Causes of death were primarily end-stage organ failure. A multidisciplinary evaluation of ECMO patients done by intensivists, cardiologists, and surgeons may influence weaning and survival rate. Our approach seems to be a safe and reproducible strategy for avoiding left ventricle distension and fluid overload, and for detecting complications that negatively affect outcomes.

We analysed postoperative complications in 106 patients after orthotopic heart transplantation based on the results of prospective observations during 2 year follow-up. Survival was estimated at 83% (88 patients).

The most frequent causes of deaths were pneumonia (28.3%), transplant rejection (11.3%), steroid-induced diabetes (14.6%). It is concluded that heart transplantation should be followed by thorough observation of the patients based at a specialized multi-field clinic to ensure continuous treatment and reduce lethality.

The impact of induction immunosuppression on long-term survival in heart transplant recipients is unclear. Over the past three decades, practices have varied as induction agents have changed and experiences grew. We sought to evaluate the effect of contemporary induction immunosuppression agents in heart transplant recipients with the primary endpoint of survival, utilizing national registry data. We queried the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data registry for all heart transplants from 1987 to 2012. We restricted our analysis to adult (\u226518\u00a0yr) recipients performed from 2001-2011 (to allow for the potential for a minimum of 12\u00a0months post-transplant follow-up) who received either: no antibody based induction (NONE) or the contemporary agents (INDUCED) of either: basiliximab/daclizumab (IL-2Rab), alemtuzumab, or ATG/ALG/thymoglobulin. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival function as well as Cox proportional hazards models were utilized. Of the 17\u00a0857 heart transplants that met the inclusion criteria, there were 4635 (26%) reported deaths during the follow-up period. There were 8216 (46%) patients who were INDUCED. Of the INDUCED agents, 55% were IL-2Rab, 4% alemtuzumab, and 40% ALG/ATG/thymoglobulin. Donor and recipient characteristics were evaluated. Overall, being INDUCED did not significantly affect survival in univariable (p\u00a0=\u00a00.522) and multivariable (p\u00a0=\u00a00.130) Cox models as well as a propensity score adjusted model (p\u00a0=\u00a00.733). Among those induced, ATG/ALG/thymoglobulin appeared to have superior survival as compared with IL-2Rab (log-rank p\u00a0=\u00a00.007, univariable hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a00.886; 95% CI: 0.811-0.968; p\u00a0=\u00a00.522). However, in a multivariable Cox model that adjusted for recipient age, VAD, BMI, steroid use, CMV match, and ischemic time, the hazard ratio for ALG/ATG/thymoglobulin vs. IL-2Rab was no longer statistically significant (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.948; 95% CI: 0.850-1.058; p\u00a0=\u00a00.341). In a contemporary analysis of heart transplant recipients, an overall analysis of induction agents does not appear to impact survival, as compared to no induction immunosuppression. While ALG/ATG/thymoglobulin appeared to have a beneficial effect on survival compared to IL-2Rab in the univariable model, this difference was no longer statistically significant once we adjusted for clinically relevant covariates.

Severe pre-transplant pulmonary hypertension (PH) has been associated with adverse short-term clinical outcomes after heart transplantation in relatively small single-center studies. The impact of pre-transplant PH on long-term survival after heart transplantation has not been examined in a large, multi-center cohort. Adults (\u226518 years) who underwent first time heart transplantation in the United States between 1987 and 2012 were retrospectively identified from the United Network for Organ Sharing registry. Pre-transplant PH was classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), trans-pulmonary gradient (TPG), and pulmonary artery (PA) mean pressure. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Data from 26,649 heart transplant recipients (mean age 52\u00b112 years; 76% male; 76% Caucasian) were analyzed. During a mean follow-up of 5.7\u00b14.8 years, there were 10,334 (39%) deaths. Pre-transplant PH (PVR\u22652.5 WU) was a significant predictor of mortality (hazard ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.14, p<0.0001) in multivariable analysis. However, the severity of pre-transplant PH (mild/moderate vs. severe) did not affect short or long-term survival. Similarly, even in patients who were supported with either a left ventricular assist device or a total artificial heart prior to transplant, severe pre-transplant PH was not associated with worse survival when compared to patients with mild/moderate pre-transplant PH. Pre-transplant PH (PVR\u22652.5 WU) is associated with a modest increase in mortality when compared to patients without pre-transplant PH.

We analyzed risk factors for death over 19 years of experience to determine how risk profiles have changed over time and how they interact with age. A multivariable parametric hazard model for death was created for 7,015 patients entered into the CTRD. Variables collected over 19 years of experience were examined as potential risk factors and tested for interaction with date of transplantation to determine if their relative risk (RR) changed over time. The hazard for death post-transplant occurred in 2 phases: an early phase of acute risk lasting <1 year, and a late phase of relatively low, gradually increasing risk (<0.1 event/year). In the early phase, predictive models showed that ventricular assist device (VAD) at the time of transplant did not increase the RR of death for recipient transplant at 30 years of age, but the RR of death was increased by 60% (p = 0.04) at 60 years of age. Of the late-phase variables found to be risk factors, the RR of age, date of transplant and pulmonary vascular resistance changed with respect to transplant year.

Compared with patients with other etiologies of restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM; n = 339 in Era 1, n = 164 in Era 2), adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for post-HT mortality of ACM were 2.08 (p < 0.0001) in Era 1 and 1.22 (p = not statistically significant) in Era 2. Adjusted HRs for mortality of ACM vs all other diagnoses (n = 36,334 in Era 1, n = 9,225 in Era 2) were 1.84 (p < 0.0001) in Era 1 and 1.38 (p = NS) in Era 2. Although post-HT survival did not change with time among non-ACM RCM patients, post-HT mortality was lower in Era 2 compared with Era 1 among ACM patients (HR 0.49, p = 0.03). Although historically associated with inferior survival, post-HT outcomes in ACM patients in the modern era are now approaching those of non-ACM patients. Changes in patients' demographics suggest that this may be related to improved patient selection, including an increased proportion of patients with transthyretin ACM.

Of these, 122 (63%) successfully bridged patients were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified into 2 groups according to their waiting time with CF-LVAD support of <1 year or \u22651 year. The study cohort was a mean age of 54 \u00b1 13 years, 79% were male, and 35% had an ischemic etiology. The mean duration of CF-LVAD support before transplantation was 296 days (range, 27-1,413 days). The overall 30-day mortality was 4.1%. Overall post-transplant survival was 88%, 84%, 78% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The 32 patients (26%) with \u22651 year of CF-LVAD support (mean, 635 days) were more likely to have blood type O, a larger body size, and to have been readmitted due to recurrent heart failure and device failure requiring exchange than those with <1 year of CF-LVAD support. Patients who required prolonged support time also had worse in-hospital mortality (16% vs 6.7%, p = 0.12) and significantly lower survival at 3 years after transplantation (68% vs 88%, p = 0.049).

Regarding survival data analysis in regression modeling, multiple conditional quantiles are useful summary statistics to assess covariate effects on survival times. In this study, we consider an estimation problem of multiple nonlinear quantile functions with right censored survival data. To account for censoring in estimating a nonlinear quantile function, weighted kernel quantile regression (WKQR) has been developed by using the kernel trick and inverse-censoring-probability weights. However, the individually estimated quantile functions based on the WKQR often cross each other and consequently violate the basic properties of quantiles. To avoid this problem of quantile crossing, we propose the non-crossing weighted kernel quantile regression (NWKQR), which estimates multiple nonlinear conditional quantile functions simultaneously by enforcing the non-crossing constraints on kernel coefficients. The numerical results are presented to demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed NWKQR over the WKQR.

The remaining 115 patients were dichotomized into survivors and non-survivors adjudicated at 3-months postoperatively, and their demographic, clinical, and longitudinal hemodynamic data were analyzed. Results. 3-month survival after heart transplantation was 86%. Non-survivors were older (59\u00b18 vs 50\u00b114 years, P=0.009), more likely to have previous cardiac surgery (44% vs 19%; odds ratio [OR] 3.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-9.90; P=0.029), lower body mass index (BMI) (25\u00b14 vs 28\u00b12 kg/m(2), P=0.001), and be diabetics (44% vs 23%; OR 2.57, 95% CI 0.86-7.66; P=0.083).

Non-survivors were more likely to have had ischemic cardiomyopathy (69% vs 32%, P=0.010). Postoperative utilization of epinephrine as a second line inotropic agent was a strong predictor of mortality (63% vs 7%; OR 21.91; 95% CI 6.15-78.06; P<0.001). Serum lactate concentrations were consistently higher among non-survivors, with the difference being most pronounced 2 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass (9.8\u00b13.5 vs 5.2\u00b13.2 mmol/L, P<0.001). The donor hearts exhibited inferior early hemodynamics in non-survivors (cardiac index 3.0\u00b11.0 vs 4.0\u00b11.1 L/min/m(2), P=0.001), stroke volume (49\u00b124 vs 59\u00b119 mL, P=0.063), and left and right ventricular stroke work indices (18\u00b18 vs 30\u00b111 g/beat/m(2), P<0.001 and 5\u00b13 vs 7\u00b14 g/beat/m(2), P=0.060, respectively).

Each device has its own technical considerations and the decision which device to use depends on several factors, including what is available, the degree of support required, and expected duration of support. Additional issues that need to be considered in choosing level of support include right heart function, respiratory failure, and multi-organ derangements.

Accepting the first suitable organ offer, regardless of the possibility of a positive crossmatch, would improve waitlist outcomes but it is unclear whether it would result in improved survival at all times after listing, including posttransplant. We created a Markov decision model to compare survival after listing with a requirement for a negative prospective donor cell crossmatch (WAIT) versus acceptance of the first suitable offer (TAKE). Model parameters were derived from registry data on status 1A (highest urgency) pediatric heart transplant listings. We assumed no possibility of a positive crossmatch in the WAIT strategy and a base-case probability of a positive crossmatch in the TAKE strategy of 47%, as estimated from cohort data. Under base-case assumptions, TAKE showed an incremental survival benefit of 1.4 years over WAIT.

One major disadvantage of ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy is the development of human-leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies. We aimed to identify factors associated with HLA antibodies during continuous flow (CF)-VAD support and assess the effect on transplant probability and outcomes. We included 143 consecutive heart failure patients who received a CF-VAD as a bridge-to-transplant at 3 institutions. Factors associated with post-VAD peak panel reactive antibodies (PRA) among several measurements were identified using multivariable linear regression. A parametric survival model was used to assess transplant waiting time and probability, risk of rejection, and a composite outcome of rejection, graft failure, and death. Thirty-six patients (25%) were female; mean age was 47 \u00b1 13 years. Eighty-one patients (57%) had a pre-VAD PRA of 0%, and 16 were highly sensitized (PRA > 80%). Age, female sex, and pre-VAD PRA were independently associated with post-VAD PRA. A 10-year increase in age was associated with a 5% decrease in post-VAD PRA (p = 0.03). Post-VAD PRA was 19% higher in women vs men (p < 0.01). A 10%-increase in pre-VAD PRA was associated with a 4.7% higher post-VAD PRA (p < 0.01).

The purpose of the study was to describe clinical characteristics and long-term survival of patients undergoing combined heart-kidney transplant in a single center. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 22 consecutive patients who underwent combined heart-kidney transplant at our institution between 1995 and 2013. Long-term outcomes were analyzed by means of the Kaplan-Meier method. Four patients underwent re-do transplant (2 cardiac re-transplants, 1 kidney re-transplant, and 1 combined heart-kidney re-transplant). Most frequent underlying cardiac conditions were coronary artery disease (54%), dilated cardiomyopathy (23%), and chronic rejection of a previous heart graft (18%). Known causes of chronic renal dysfunction were nephroangioesclerosis (23%), drug-related toxicity (14%), and Wegener granulomatosis (5%). Non-specified chronic renal dysfunction was present in 50% patients. In-hospital postoperative mortality rate was 5 of 22 (23%). Causes of early death were directly related to kidney transplant surgery in 4 of 5 (80%) patients. Among the remaining 17 patients who surmounted the postoperative period, long-term survival rates 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years after HKT were 88%, 82%, and 65%, respectively. Over a mean follow-up of 6.7 \u00b1 6.4 years, cumulative incidences of cytomegalovirus infection, coronary allograft vasculopathy, malignancy, and acute cardiac graft rejection were 41%, 6%, 24%, and 41%, respectively. There was no episode of acute renal graft rejection. At the end of follow-up, all survivors (n = 11) were in functional New York Heart Association class I. Mean creatinine serum level was 1.68 mg/dL. In our experience, combined heart-kidney transplant is a feasible therapeutic option that yielded favorable long-term outcomes, with a low cumulative incidence of cardiac graft dysfunction. These results were obtained at the expense of a significant risk of early postoperative mortality, which was mainly related to complications of kidney transplant surgery.

This study evaluated whether minority orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients tend to be transplanted at worse performing centers. OHT recipients between 2000 and 2010 were identified in the United Network for Organ Sharing database and stratified by race. Center performance was evaluated using observed-to-expected mortality ratios that were calculated using validated indexes for recipient and donor risk in OHT. The primary outcome was 1-year post-OHT mortality. A total of 102 centers performed OHT in 18 085 patients. Blacks had higher unadjusted 1-year mortality, which was confirmed after risk adjustment. Blacks had increased risk-adjusted mortality at poor performing centers (observed-to-expected mortality ratio, >1.2; odds ratio, 1.37 [95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.69]; P=0.002) and a strong trend toward increased mortality at excellent performing centers (observed-to-expected mortality ratio, <0.8; odds ratio, 1.42 [95% confidence interval, 0.99-2.02]; P=0.06). A higher proportion of blacks were treated at centers with higher-than-expected mortality (56.4% versus 47.1% whites versus 48.1% Hispanics; P<0.001), a finding that persisted after adjusting for insurance type and highest education level. In addition, there was a positive correlation between the percentage of blacks and observed-to-expected mortality ratios at the center level (r=0.32; P=0.001). In multivariable analysis incorporating immunologic and socioeconomic variables, there was no clear dominant source for the disparities in outcomes of OHT between races. Blacks have a propensity to be transplanted at worse performing centers; however, center effect alone does not explain the mortality difference between ethnicities. Although referral of minorities to better performing centers would improve absolute survival, it would not likely eliminate the racial disparities that exist in OHT outcomes.

The number of heart transplantations is limited by donor organ availability. Donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD) could significantly improve graft availability; however, organs undergo warm ischaemia followed by reperfusion, leading to tissue damage. Laboratory studies suggest that mechanical postconditioning [(MPC); brief, intermittent periods of ischaemia at the onset of reperfusion] can limit reperfusion injury; however, clinical translation has been disappointing. We hypothesized that MPC-induced cardioprotection depends on fatty acid levels at reperfusion. Experiments were performed with an isolated rat heart model of DCDD. Hearts of male Wistar rats (n = 42) underwent working-mode perfusion for 20 min (baseline), 27 min of global ischaemia and 60 min reperfusion with or without MPC (two cycles of 30 s reperfusion/30 s ischaemia) in the presence or absence of high fat [(HF); 1.2 mM palmitate]. Haemodynamic parameters, necrosis factors and oxygen consumption (O2C) were assessed. Recovery rate was calculated as the value at 60 min reperfusion expressed as a percentage of the mean baseline value. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to provide an overview of differences between experimental groups, and pairwise comparisons were performed to compare specific time points of interest for parameters with significant overall results. Percent recovery of left ventricular (LV) work [developed pressure (DP)-heart rate product] at 60 min reperfusion was higher in hearts reperfused without fat versus with fat (58 \u00b1 8 vs 23 \u00b1 26%, P < 0.01) in the absence of MPC. In the absence of fat, MPC did not affect post-ischaemic haemodynamic recovery. Among the hearts reperfused with HF, two significantly different subgroups emerged according to recovery of LV work: low recovery (LoR) and high recovery (HiR) subgroups. At 60 min reperfusion, recovery was increased with MPC versus no MPC for LV work (79 \u00b1 6 vs 55 \u00b1 7, respectively; P < 0.05) in HiR subgroups and for DP (40 \u00b1 27 vs 4 \u00b1 2%), dP/dtmax (37 \u00b1 24 vs 5 \u00b1 3%) and dP/dtmin (33 \u00b1 21 vs 5 \u00b1 4%; P < 0.01 for all) in LoR subgroups. Effects of MPC depend on energy substrate availability; MPC increased recovery of LV work in the presence, but not in the absence, of HF. Controlled reperfusion may be useful for therapeutic strategies aimed at improving post-ischaemic recovery of cardiac DCDD grafts, and ultimately in increasing donor heart availability.

The endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is considered the gold standard in rejection surveillance post cardiac transplant, but is invasive, with risk of complications. A previous trial suggested that the gene expression profiling (GEP) blood test was noninferior to EMB between 6 and 60 months post transplant. As most rejections occur in the first 6 months, we conducted a single-center randomized trial of GEP versus EMB starting at 55 days post transplant (when GEP is valid). Sixty heart transplant patients meeting inclusion criteria were randomized beginning at 55 days post transplant to either GEP or EMB arms. A positive GEP \u226530 between 2 and 6 months, or \u226534 after 6 months, prompted a follow-up biopsy. The primary end point included a composite of death/retransplant, rejection with hemodynamic compromise or graft dysfunction at 18 months post transplant. A coprimary end point included change in first-year maximal intimal thickness by intravascular ultrasound, a recognized surrogate for long-term outcome. Corticosteroid weaning was assessed in both the groups. The composite end point was similar between the GEP and EMB groups (10% versus 17%; log-rank P=0.44). The coprimary end point of first-year intravascular ultrasound change demonstrated no difference in mean maximal intimal thickness (0.35\u00b10.36 versus 0.36\u00b10.26 mm; P=0.944). Steroid weaning was successful in both the groups (91% versus 95%). In this pilot study, GEP starting at 55 days post transplant seems comparable with EMB for rejection surveillance in selected heart transplant patients and does not result in increased adverse outcomes. GEP also seems useful to guide corticosteroid weaning. Larger randomized trials are required to confirm these findings. URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT014182482377.

In adults, it has been identified that 5% to 10% of the VAD population is benefited by BiVAD support over left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support. An analysis of the Berlin Heart study cohort was performed to characterize patients supported with BiVAD, examine risk factors of mortality in this group, and identify subsets of patients in whom BiVAD is associated with survival. All EXCOR Pediatric devices (Berlin Heart, Inc, The Woodlands, TX) placed in North America between May 2007 and December 2010 comprised the study cohort of 204 patients (128 [63%] LVADs and 76\u00a0[37%] BiVADs). The following patient cohorts were analyzed to determine the effect of BiVAD use on survival: Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) profile 1 patients, patients with abnormal bilirubin levels, patients who received previous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and patients with a 10-mL pump size. There were more patients with BiVADs in INTERMACS profile 1 (63% compared with 46%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.018).

White race, abnormal glomerular filtration rate (GFR), sites with experience of less than 5 implantations, and use of 10-mL pumps were predictors of mortality in patients who received BiVADs. BiVADs were not associated with improved survival in any patient cohort; however, they were associated with increased mortality in patients who had undergone ECMO before receiving a VAD. BiVAD support was not associated with improved survival in any identified subset of patients. Although not randomized, these results (which were corrected for multiple possible risk factors) suggest that some children supported with BiVADs might have done better with LVADs alone. Further prospective studies will be needed to identify patient cohorts that will be better served with BIVAD support.

The EMBs were categorized as asymptomatic or clinically driven and were compared based on era of antiproliferative therapy use at our center (early azathioprine era: 1990-2000 vs modern mycophenolate era: 2000-2011).

In the early era, the odds ratio of rejection during asymptomatic EMB compared to a clinically driven EMB was 0.47 (95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.71) and was decreased in the modern era (0.17 [0.07-0.42], P = 0.04). The probability of detecting rejection on asymptomatic EMB was significantly reduced in the modern era, even after adjustment for tacrolimus and induction therapy (1% vs 8%, P < 0.001).

Baseline characteristics and outcomes in the two patient groups were evaluated using descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier, and regression analysis. Thirty-eight patients were included in the study (17 sensitized vs. 21 non-sensitized). There were more women in the sensitized group (47% vs. 10%, p = 0.023). There was no difference in mean times to high-grade acute cellular rejection (ACR; 18.3 months in sensitized vs. 36.9 months in non-sensitized). Five patients in the sensitized groups developed antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) vs. 0 in the non-sensitized, and all five patients died (Kaplan-Meier log-rank p = 0.024). There was also a significant difference in the incidence of infection at the one- to six-month stage (52.9% vs. 19.0%, p = 0.03). Sensitization appears to have a negative effect on mortality.

The first pediatric heart transplant was performed more than 25 years ago. The results, in terms of mortality and morbidity, have gradually improved over the years, and quality of life and development are thus becoming increasingly important issues. Functional capacity is considered excellent by most recipients: 90% have few if any symptoms. Objective exercise capacity is usually subnormal, however, mainly owing to the inability of the heart rate to increase with exercise. Early cardiac rehabilitation should be encouraged in order to optimize the capacity for physical activity. Recipients can be expected to have neurodevelopmental outcomes in the low-to-normal range, with a 10- to 15-point deficit compared with normal children. Global cognitive abilities and school performance can be affected, particularly in mathematics. Moreover, 20% to 30% of these patients have behavioral and psychological disorders, which are relatively stable over time. Neurodevelopmental outcome is poorer in patients grafted because of a congenital heart defect and is consistent with that of other children with complex congenital heart diseases requiring surgical intervention. This suggests that these problems may be related more to the underlying heart disease than to transplantation itself.

Heart failure (HF) is a condition in which the heart is not able to pump enough blood and oxygen required for organ systems to function.

About half of people who develop HF die within 5 years of diagnosis. HF costs the nation an estimated $32 billion each year.

Orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) remains the gold standard for end-stage heart failure. However, donor availability is severely limited. With a median wait time of 6.6 months and more than 12% of patients waiting 5 or more years, the decision is often made to implant a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as\u00a0a bridge to transplantation for medical stabilization. Furthermore, the number of patients who have had at least one prior sternotomy while awaiting transplantation is increasing. Previous studies have indicated reoperative sternotomy as a risk factor for compromised survival. Concerns are specifically focused on perioperative, short-term, and long-term outcomes after LVAD explantation or redo sternotomy before OHT because of increasing operative complexity. We hypothesize that despite the greater technical difficulty caused by LVAD explantation or redo sternotomy, outcomes would not be compromised. We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent OHT at the University of Pennsylvania during a 5-year period (2008-2013; n\u00a0= 253). All patients who underwent a bridge to transplantation LVAD (n\u00a0= 72) or prior sternotomy (n\u00a0= 65) were compared with those undergoing OHT with a virgin chest (n\u00a0= 116). Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were analyzed. Short- and long-term survival were studied (minimum follow-up, 6 months). Comorbidities were similar among the groups. There was no difference in donor allograft ischemic time (p\u00a0= 0.6). However, cardiopulmonary bypass time was longer in both bridge to transplantation and prior sternotomy cohorts (p < 0.00001). The blood transfusion requirement was higher in bridge to transplantation (12.5 \u00b1 13.7 units; p\u00a0= 0.0007) and prior sternotomy groups (11.7 \u00b1 12.9 units; p\u00a0= 0.02) as compared with the virgin chest cohort (7.1 \u00b1 10.7 units). For bridge to transplantation, both time to extubation (1.0 \u00b1 1.6 versus 0.9 \u00b1 1.0 days; p\u00a0= 0.03) and intensive care unit length of stay (7.0 \u00b1 7.0 versus 6.0 \u00b1 7.0 days; p\u00a0= 0.06) were longer compared with the virgin chest cohort.

There was no difference in hospital length of stay (p\u00a0= 0.2). Overall, there was no difference in short- or long-term survival. Implantation of an LVAD as a bridge to transplantation or prior sternotomy does not adversely impact allograft function, hospital length of stay, or long-term outcomes after OHT.

The cohort of long-term survivors of heart transplant is expanding, and the assessment of these patients requires specific knowledge of the surgical techniques employed to implant the donor heart, the physiology of the transplanted heart, complications of invasive tests routinely performed to detect graft rejection (GR), and the specific pathologies that may affect the transplanted heart. A joint EACVI/Brazilian cardiovascular imaging writing group committee has prepared these recommendations to provide a practical guide to echocardiographers involved in the follow-up of heart transplant patients and a framework for standardized and efficient use of cardiovascular imaging after heart transplant. Since the transplanted heart is smaller than the recipient's dilated heart, the former is usually located more medially in the mediastinum and tends to be rotated clockwise. Therefore, standard views with conventional two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography are often difficult to obtain generating a large variability from patient to patient. Therefore, in echocardiography laboratories equipped with three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) scanners and specific expertise with the technique, 3DE may be a suitable alternative to conventional 2D echocardiography to assess the size and the function of cardiac chambers. 3DE measurement of left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) size and function are more accurate and reproducible than conventional 2D calculations. However, clinicians should be aware that cardiac chamber volumes obtained with 3DE cannot be compared with those obtained with 2D echocardiography. To assess cardiac chamber morphology and function during follow-up studies, it is recommended to obtain a comprehensive echocardiographic study at 6 months from the cardiac transplantation as a baseline and make a careful quantitation of cardiac chamber size, RV systolic function, both systolic and diastolic parameters of LV function, and pulmonary artery pressure. Subsequent echocardiographic studies should be interpreted in comparison with the data obtained from the 6-month study. An echocardiographic study, which shows no change from the baseline study, has a high negative predictive value for GR. There is no single systolic or diastolic parameter that can be reliably used to diagnose GR. However, in case several parameters are abnormal, the likelihood of GR increases. When an abnormality is detected, careful revision of images of the present and baseline study (side-by-side) is highly recommended. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) is a suitable parameter to diagnose subclinical allograft dysfunction, regardless of aetiology, by comparing the changes occurring during serial evaluations. Evaluation of GLS could be used in association with endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) to characterize and monitor an acute GR or global dysfunction episode. RV size and function at baseline should be assessed using several parameters, which do not exclusively evaluate longitudinal function. At follow-up echocardiogram, all these parameters should be compared with the baseline values. 3DE may provide a more accurate and comprehensive assessment of RV size and function. Moreover, due to the unpredictable shape of the atria in transplanted patients, atrial volume should be measured using the discs' summation algorithm (biplane algorithm for the left atrium) or 3DE. Tricuspid regurgitation should be looked for and properly assessed in all echocardiographic studies. In case of significant changes in severity of tricuspid regurgitation during follow-up, a 2D/3D and colour Doppler assessment of its severity and mechanisms should be performed. Aortic and mitral valves should be evaluated according to current recommendations. Pericardial effusion should be serially evaluated regarding extent, location, and haemodynamic impact. In case of newly detected pericardial effusion, GR should be considered taking into account the overall echocardiographic assessment and patient evaluation. Dobutamine stress echocardiography might be a suitable alternative to routine coronary angiography to assess cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) at centres with adequate experience with the methodology. Coronary flow reserve and/or contrast infusion to assess myocardial perfusion might be combined with stress echocardiography to improve the accuracy of the test. In addition to its role in monitoring cardiac chamber function and in diagnosis the occurrence of GR and/or CAV, in experienced centres, echocardiography might be an alternative to fluoroscopy to guide EMB, particularly in children and young women, since echocardiography avoids repeated X-ray exposure, permits visualization of soft tissues and safer performance of biopsies of different RV regions. Finally, in addition to the indications about when and how to use echocardiography, the document also addresses the role of the other cardiovascular imaging modalities during follow-up of heart transplant patients. In patients with inadequate acoustic window and contraindication to contrast agents, pharmacological SPECT is an alternative imaging modality to detect CAV in heart transplant patients. However, in centres with adequate expertise, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in conjunction with coronary angiography with a baseline study at 4-6 weeks and at 1 year after heart transplant should be performed to exclude donor coronary artery disease, to detect rapidly progressive CAV, and to provide prognostic information. Despite the fact that coronary angiography is the current gold-standard method for the detection of CAV, the use of IVUS should also be considered when there is a discrepancy between non-invasive imaging tests and coronary angiography concerning the presence of CAV. In experienced centres, computerized tomography coronary angiography is a good alternative to coronary angiography to detect CAV. In patients with a persistently high heart rate, scanners that provide high temporal resolution, such as dual-source systems, provide better image quality. Finally, in patients with insufficient acoustic window, cardiac magnetic resonance is an alternative to echocardiography to assess cardiac chamber volumes and function and to exclude acute GR and CAV in a surveillance protocol.

No patient in the DLI group had infections attributable to the same organism responsible for pretransplant DLI. In patients with active DLI, induction immunosuppression after OHT did not increase LOS, infections, or mortality after at least 30 months of follow-up and therefore it appears to be a safe and feasible therapeutic option.

This study investigated the association between arterial remodeling and geographic distribution of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), and outcomes after heart transplantation. CAV is characterized by a combination of coronary intimal thickening and pathological vessel remodeling, which varies at different locations in coronary arteries. In 100 transplant recipients, serial volumetric intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) was performed at baseline and 1 year post-transplantation in the first 50 mm of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). IVUS indices were evaluated in the entire segment and 3 equally divided LAD segments. Paradoxical vessel remodeling was defined as [\u0394vessel volume/\u0394intimal volume\u00a0<0]. After 1 year, death or re-transplantation occurred in 20 patients over a median follow-up period of 4.7 years. Paradoxical vessel remodeling was observed in 57%, 41%, 50%, and 40% for the entire vessel, proximal, middle, and distal LAD segments, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly lower event-free rate of survival in patients with paradoxical vessel remodeling involving the proximal LAD segment, which was not present when involving the entire LAD or mid and distal LAD segments. In multivariate analysis, paradoxical vessel remodeling of the proximal LAD segment was independently associated with death or re-transplantation (hazard ratio [HR]: 11.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.39 to 83.23; p\u00a0= 0.0015). Despite the diffuse nature of CAV, paradoxical vessel remodeling of the proximal LAD segment at 1\u00a0year was the primary determinant of long-term mortality or re-transplantation. Assessment of arterial remodeling combined with coronary intimal thickening may enhance identification of high-risk patients who may benefit from closer follow-up and targeted medical therapies.

Patients requiring a RVAD + LVAD as a bridge to transplant were compared with patients requiring a LVAD only and patients requiring no ventricular assist device (VAD). During the study period, 16,955 orthotopic heart transplantations were performed. Of these, 13,209 (77.9%) patients did not require a VAD, 3,270 (19.3%) required a LVAD only, and 457 (2.7%) required a RVAD + LVAD. The RVAD + LVAD group had the longest length of stay (25.7 days) compared with the no VAD group (20.8 days) and the LVAD-only group (21.1 days) (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, requirement of a RVAD + LVAD before transplantation was independently associated with post-transplant mortality (hazard ratio 1.22, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.49, p = 0.04).

Renal dysfunction (RD) is a potent risk factor for death in patients with cardiovascular disease. This relationship may be causal; experimentally induced RD produces findings such as myocardial necrosis and apoptosis in animals. Cardiac transplantation provides an opportunity to investigate this hypothesis in humans. Cardiac transplantations from the United Network for Organ Sharing registry were studied (n\u2009=\u200923,056). RD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate\u2009<60\u2009mL/min/1.73\u2009m(2). RD was present in 17.9% of donors and 39.4% of recipients.

The risk for adverse recipient outcomes associated with RD does not appear to be transferrable from donor to recipient via the cardiac allograft, and the risk associated with recipient RD is greatest immediately following transplant.

Mean age at HT was 30.3 \u00b1 10.5 years. Twenty-five patients (25.8%) had biventricular physiology with a systemic right ventricle and 43 patients (44%) had univentricular physiology. Adults with congenital heart disease severity were classified as great complexity (74.2%), moderate (21.7%), and simple (4.1%). During a median follow-up of 28.7 months [0-282], 44 patients died. Early mortality was high (34%; 95% CI 0.2536-0.4390). Survival was 63.9% at 1 year. The proportion of univentricular patients did not change. Biventricular patients with systemic right ventricle significantly increased in era 2 (16.7 \u00a0vs. 34.7%, P = 0.04) due to increasing number of transposition of the great arteries with atrial switch.

Change in plaque progression was measured in a blinded fashion on matched coronary segments and contrasted between patients induced with ATG and those who were not. One hundred and three patients were included in IVUS arms. Mean age at transplant was 55.8 \u00b1 12.6 years, and 33.0% were female. Patients induced with ATG were more sensitized (54.3% versus 14.3%). Plaque progression was attenuated in patients who received ATG by changes in maximal intimal area (1.0 \u00b1 1.2 versus 2.3 \u00b1 2.6 mm(2); P = 0.001), maximal percent stenosis (6.3 \u00b1 7.9 versus 12.8 \u00b1 12.3%; = 0.003), maximal intimal thickness (0.2 \u00b1 0.2 versus 0.3 \u00b1 0.3 mm; P = 0.035), and plaque volume (0.5 \u00b1 0.7 versus 1.0 \u00b1 1.3 mm(3)/mm; P = 0.016). Rapid plaque progression by maximal percent stenosis (\u2265 20%) occurred less frequently in the ATG arm (4.3% versus 26.3; P = 0.003). Survival (P = 0.242) and any treated rejection (P = 0.166) were not statistically different between groups. Patients receiving ATG had a higher rate of first-year infection (P = 0.003), perhaps related to increased intravenous antibiotic use immediately postoperatively, and a trend toward more biopsy-proven rejection (P = 0.073). Induction therapy with ATG is associated with reduced first-year coronary plaque progression as assessed by IVUS, despite an increased prevalence of sensitized patients with a trend toward more rejection.

Available UNOS data were queried between 2005 and 2013 for heart transplant recipients aged \u226518 years to create separate cox-proportional hazard models for recipient and donor risk scoring. On the basis of risk scores, recipients were divided into five groups and donors into three groups. Kaplan-Meier curves were used for survival. Total 17,131 patients had heart transplant within specified time period. Major factors within high-risk groups were body mass index > 30 kg/m (46%), mean pulmonary artery pressure >30 mmHg (65%), creatinine > 1.5 mg% (63%), bilirubin > 1.5 mg% (54%), noncontinuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (45%) for recipients and gender mismatch (81%) and ischemia time >4 hours (88%) for donors.

Combining donor and recipient groups based on scoring showed acceptable survival in low-risk recipients with high-risk donor (75% at 5 years). A higher recipient and donor risk score are associated with worse long-term survival. A low-risk recipient transplanted with high-risk donor has acceptable survival at 5 years, but high-risk recipient combined with a high-risk donor has marginal results.

Between 1985 and 2013, a total of 569 heart transplants was performed at the authors' institution. Twenty patients (13 men, seven women; mean age 39.5 +/- 15.2 years) underwent heart transplant due to structural (primary) valvular disease.

We determined the rates and outcomes of HT in a national, population-based multicentre study. From 1990 to 2015, 1369 patients underwent the Fontan procedure as recorded in the Australia and New Zealand Fontan Registry. We identified those who underwent HT and analysed their outcomes. We compared rates of HT between two catchment areas. In area 1 (n=721), patients were referred to the national paediatric HT programme or its associated adult programme. In area 2 (n=648), patients were referred to the national paediatric HT programme or one of the other adult HT programmes. Mean follow-up time post-Fontan was 11\u00b18\u2005years. Freedom from Fontan failure was 74%\u00b13.9% at 20\u2005years. HT was performed in 34 patients. Patients living in area 1 were more likely to have HT (4.0%, 29/721 vs 0.8%, 5/648, p<0.001) with a cumulative proportion of 3.4% vs 0.7% at 10\u2005years and 6.8% vs 1.2% at 20\u2005years (p=0.002).

Paediatric heart transplantation is performed to salvage children with end-stage heart failure from various underlying pathologies. Despite several developments in all management aspects of transplantation candidates, the effect of those advances on outcomes has not been consistent. We report our institutional experience with focus on examining era effect on early and late survival. Between 1988 and 2015, 320 children underwent heart transplantation. Competing risk analysis modelled events after transplantation (retransplantation, death without retransplantation). Multivariable parametric risk hazard analysis examined the risk factors affecting survival. Patients were divided to three groups based on underlying pathology: congenital group (n = 132, 41%), acquired group (n = 153, 48%) and retransplant group (n = 35, 11%). Competing risk analysis showed that at 10 years following transplantation, 11% of patients had undergone retransplantation, 39% had died without retransplantation and 44% were alive without retransplantation. Ten-year survival was 61, 51 and 45% for acquired, congenital and retransplant groups, respectively. Overall, survival following heart transplantation for the late era (2005-15) was 63% compared with 49% for the early era (1988-2004) at 10 years (P = 0.022). Compared with early era, 1-year survival in the late era was 84 vs 79% {odds ratio (OR): 0.72 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3-1.8], P = 0.470} for congenital, 98 vs 86% [OR: 0.14 (95% CI 0.03-0.68), P = 0.006] for acquired and 73 vs 88% [OR: 2.6 (95% CI 0.4-1.9), P = 0.282] for retransplant. The effect of late era on survival was not significant for congenital [hazard ratio (HR) 0.6 (95% CI 0.2-1.4), P = 0.206] or retransplant patients [HR: 1.7 (95% CI 0.5-5.5), P = 0.400], but showed improvement trend for acquired patients [HR: 0.53 (95% CI 0.3-1.0), P = 0.052]. The era effect on early survival following heart transplantation is related to underlying pathology; there is a significant improvement in early survival in children with acquired pathology, whereas there is no significant change in early survival in children with congenital pathology or failed prior transplantation. This suggests a potential area for improvement that might include pretransplant stabilization and management of immunosuppression. On the other hand, era effect on late survival is not significant. This demonstrates that advances in the care of paediatric heart transplantation patients have not affected ongoing problems that diminish late survival.

Heart transplantation is the most effective therapy for patients with Stage D heart failure with a median life expectancy of \u224810 to 15 years. Unfortunately, many patients die on the waiting list hoping for a chance of survival. The life boat cannot rescue everyone. Over a decade, the donor pool has remained relatively stable, whereas the number of heart transplant candidates has risen. Potential recipients often have many comorbidities and are older because the criteria for heart transplantation has few absolute contraindications. Women, Hispanics, and patients with restrictive heart disease and congenital heart disease are more likely to die while awaiting heart transplantation than men, white patients, and those with either ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy. To better match the market, we need to (1) increase the donor pool, (2) reduce the waitlist, and (3) improve the allocation system.

The objective of this European multicenter study was to report surgical outcomes of Fontan takedown, Fontan conversion and heart transplantation (HTX) for failing Fontan patients in terms of all-cause mortality and (re-)HTX. A retrospective international study was conducted by the European Congenital Heart Surgeons Association among 22 member centres. Outcome of surgery to address failing Fontan was collected in 225 patients among which were patients with Fontan takedown (n=38; 17%), Fontan conversion (n=137; 61%) or HTX (n=50; 22%). The most prevalent indication for failing Fontan surgery was arrhythmia (43.6%), but indications differed across the surgical groups (p<0.001). Fontan takedown was mostly performed in the early postoperative phase after Fontan completion, while Fontan conversion and HTX were mainly treatment options for late failure. Early (30\u2005days) mortality was high for Fontan takedown (ie, 26%). Median follow-up was 5.9\u2005years (range 0-23.7\u2005years). The combined end point mortality/HTX was reached in 44.7% of the Fontan takedown patients, in 26.3% of the Fontan conversion patients and in 34.0% of the HTX patients, respectively (log rank p=0.08). Survival analysis showed no difference between Fontan conversion and HTX (p=0.13), but their ventricular function differed significantly. In patients who underwent Fontan conversion or HTX ventricular systolic dysfunction appeared to be the strongest predictor of mortality or (re-)HTX. Patients with valveless atriopulmonary connection (APC) take more advantage of Fontan conversion than patients with a valve-containing APC (p=0.04).

CAV is a leading cause of late graft failure, mortality, and re-transplantation in pediatric heart transplant (HTx) recipients. Studies of PCI in adult patients have shown some short-term improvements, but no significant change in long-term outcomes. There are limited data on PCI for CAV in pediatric patients. We describe the largest single-center experience to date. We performed a retrospective chart review of all pediatric HTx recipients who underwent PCI for a diagnosis of CAV from 2005 to 2014. Twenty-three procedures were performed in 13 patients, at a median age of 16.4 years (range 5.6-21.2) and median time from HTx to first PCI of 8.3 years (range 2.9-20.3). Three cases consisted of angioplasty alone, two cases had bare metal stents implanted, and the remaining 18 had drug-eluting stents implanted. There was acute procedural success in all but one case, and there was only one procedure-related complication (rebleeding from access site). During the follow-up interval (median 10.4 months, range 0.2-111.8), 7/13 patients had repeat PCI performed, two patients died (at 1.8 and 5.8 months post-PCI), and five were re-transplanted (range 0.2-18 months post-PCI). Freedom from death or retransplant by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 54% at 1 year. PCI can be performed safely and effectively in pediatric HTx recipients with CAV.

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is common during infant cardiac surgery. A previous report of pediatric heart transplant recipients showed that increased RBC transfusion volume was independently associated with increased length of intensive care unit stay. It is unclear whether transfusion to infants as a subgroup carries similar risks. This study investigated relationships between intraoperative RBC transfusion during heart transplantation and postoperative length of stay (LOS), morbidity, and mortality in infants. Retrospective analysis of medical records from infants <1 year old undergoing primary heart transplantation at Loma Linda University Medical Center from 1985 to 2012 was conducted. Exclusion criteria included preoperative exchange transfusion or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Data sought included patient characteristics; intraoperative RBC transfusion volume and cardiopulmonary bypass details; and postoperative vasoactive support, ventilator support, morbidity, LOS, and 30-day mortality. The relationship of RBC transfusion volume (mL/kg) to these postoperative variables was assessed by univariate analysis. Multiple regression analysis of postoperative LOS included variables that were independent predictors of LOS or associated with \u226510% change in the \u03b2-estimate for RBC effect. Data from 307 infants showed that most (66.8%) had single-ventricle physiology. Median age at transplant was 50 days, weight 3.95 kg, and intraoperative transfusion volume 109 mL/kg. Transfusion volume was inversely related to age and weight. Median postoperative LOS was 18.2 days. Univariate linear regression analysis of transfused volume showed no relationship to log-transformed postoperative LOS (F(1,305) = 0.00; P = 0.960; R = 0.000; \u03b2-coefficient = 0.004; 95% confidence interval = -0.1542 to 0.1623). Transfused volume was not related to 30-day mortality (difference -0.162; -0.048 to 0.371 mL/kg; P = 0.112) or to postoperative ventilator support (R = 0.047), but was greater in patients who required reoperation (difference -0.246; -0.494 to -0.025; P = 0.004). Multiple regression analysis for all patients revealed age, preoperative ventilator support, prolonged postoperative ventilatory or vasoactive support, transplant year, and 30-day mortality, but not major adverse events, to be significant confounding variables. Adjusting for these variables, transfused volume was not associated with prolonged postoperative LOS. In contrast to a prior report, we found no correlation between intraoperative RBC transfusion and postoperative LOS when studying only infants. Infants have maturing organ systems, less physiologic reserve, and increased surgical blood loss (evaluated as mL/kg) during cardiac surgery than their larger, older counterparts, distinguishing them from the general pediatric population. These differences require additional studies to determine the outcome impact of transfusion strategies in the infant subgroup.

Donor heart availability has limited the number of heart transplants performed in the United States, while the number of patients waiting for a transplant continues to increase. Optimizing the use of all available donor hearts is important to reduce waiting list deaths and to increase the number of patients who can ultimately undergo a successful heart transplant. Donor cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) time has been proposed to be a selection criterion to consider in donor selection. This study examined whether the duration of donor CPR time affects recipient posttransplantation outcomes and survival. The United Network of Organ Sharing database was retrospectively queried from January 2005 to December 2013 to identify adult patients who underwent heart transplantation. This population was divided into four groups: donors with no CPR, CPR of less than 20 minutes, CPR of 20 to 30 minutes, and CPR exceeding 30 minutes. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare the recipient posttransplant survival between groups, and posttransplant outcomes were examined. Propensity matching was performed for comparison of posttransplant survival of recipients of donors who did and did not undergo CPR. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to examine individual independent variables for death after transplant. During this period, 17,022 patients underwent heart transplantation. Of those, 16,042 patients received hearts from a donor with no CPR, 639 patients with donor CPR of less than 20 minutes, 154 patients with donor CPR 20 to 30 minutes, and 187 patients with donor CPR exceeding 30 minutes.

Recipient primary graft failure and rejection rates were similar among the groups. The multivariable regression model showed CPR duration was not an independent risk factor for posttransplant death.

Although the impact of older donors on heart transplant outcomes has been previously published, the survival results are conflicting. We herein analyse the impact of older donors on transplant survival and myocardial function. The records of the patients who underwent heart transplant at Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas from November 2012 until March 2015 were reviewed and the data were extracted. The heart recipients were divided into two groups based on donors age; 50 years of age was the division point. The two groups were compared with regard to the following transplant outcomes: in-hospital and 1-year survival, severe (3R) rejection, primary graft dysfunction, myocardial performance as reflected by the inotropic score, left ventricular ejection fraction, intensive care unit and overall length of stay. Anoxia was more common cause of death in younger donors (43.9%), whereas intracranial bleeding was more frequent in older donors (48.1%, P = 0.016). The in-hospital survival and 1-year survival were the same between the two groups. Additionally, cardiac transplantation from older donors was not associated with higher incidence of graft dysfunction, higher inotropic support score, longer intensive care unit and total hospital length of stay or more frequent severe rejection episodes. The left ventricular ejection fraction was similar between the two groups. Heart transplant from older donors is not associated with lower in-hospital and mid-term survival if donors are carefully selected; furthermore, the graft function is comparable.

In France, a higher priority status is granted to transplant candidates on VA-ECMO than to those on long-term mechanical circulatory support. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of transplantation as primary therapy on survival in patients on VA-ECMO at listing.

We compared outcomes of 80 patients on VA-ECMO at listing to outcomes of the comparison group. In the VA-ECMO group, a Cox proportional hazard model with transplantation as a time dependent variable was used to evaluate the effect of transplantation on survival. Patients on VA-ECMO were more often on ventilator and dialysis and had a higher bilirubin level than other candidates. One-year overall survival rate was lower in candidates from the study group (52.2%) compared with comparison group (75.5%), (P < 0.01).

We analysed age as a prognostic factor at long-term after HTx and if it should be a determinant in organ allocation. Data of 364 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac transplantation between 1999 and 2014 at the University Hospital of Udine were analysed. Patients were divided into three groups according to age (Group 1: 18-40, Group 2: 41-59, Group 3: \u2265 60 years) and survival and major complications were evaluated at long-term (mean follow-up 6.7 \u00b1 4.5 years, range 1-15.7 years). Preoperatively, renal failure (2.9, 16.1, 39.5%, P < 0.01) and cardiovascular factors such as diabetes (1.2, 17.1, 36.4%, P < 0.01), systemic hypertension (5.9, 31.5, 40.8%, P < 0.01) and dyslipidaemia (5.9, 40.3, 42.9%, P < 0.01) were more common in older patients (Group 3), as well as ischaemic cardiopathy (0, 42.6, 49.7%, P < 0.01).

Older patients showed a worse long-term survival (hazard ratio 1.7; 1.1-2.5), also after adjusting for major cardiovascular risk factors, renal failure and donor age. In fact, 15-year survival was 100% in Group 1, while at 1, 5, 10 and 15 years survival was 88, 78, 69 and 56% in Group 2, and 87, 68, 49 and 43% in Group 3, respectively.

The aim of this study was to determine whether the duration of left ventricular device support (LVAD) influenced outcomes after orthotopic heart transplantation in a modern, bridge to transplant national cohort. The United Network for Organ Sharing database, which has recently made pretransplant LVAD duration available, was queried for all adult bridge to transplant patients between January 2011 and December 2012. Three LVAD duration cohorts were generated, as follows: short (less than 90 days), intermediate (90 to 365\u00a0days), and prolonged (more than 365 days). Recipient,\u00a0donor, and transplant-specific characteristics were compared among the duration cohorts. Unadjusted short-term and long-term survivals were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Risk-adjusted models were also constructed to determine the independent impact of device duration on mortality. Of the 1,332 patients who met criteria for inclusion, 9.8% (n\u00a0= 130), 54.7% (n\u00a0= 729), and 35.5% (n\u00a0= 473) were classified as short, intermediate, and prolonged, respectively.

Additionally, despite worse baseline renal function in the intermediate and prolonged cohorts relative to the short cohort (glomerular filtration rate, 57 and 57 versus 69, p < 0.001), there was no\u00a0difference in the incidence of new onset posttransplant renal failure (7% versus 10%, 9%, p\u00a0= 0.41).

We aimed to evaluate the impact of the stated reasons for status 1A at time of transplantation on post-transplantation survival in CFVAD patients.

Diagnosing and monitoring acute rejection (AR) and cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is essential for graft and transplant patient survival and, consequently, a major objective for heart transplant patient surveillance. Because functionally relevant CAV can arise and progress without clinical symptoms and sub-clinical ARs can facilitate the development of CAV, standard surveillance of AR and CAV includes routine endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) and coronary angiography (CA) screenings at pre-defined time intervals. However, these invasive screenings (distressing and risky for the patients) cannot solely diagnose all sub-clinical AR episodes and also not always detect coronary stenoses before a clinical event. Additional close-meshed, non-invasive AR and CAV surveillance strategies are therefore mandatory. After the introduction of tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and strain imaging for myocardial wall motion and deformation analysis, echocardiography became particularly promising for that purpose. Allowing quantification of minor myocardial dysfunction not detectable by standard echocardiography, TDI and strain imaging can reveal sub-clinical AR. Thus, these approaches can be a valuable supplement to EMB, enabling more efficient AR monitoring with fewer EMBs (only diagnostic EMBs) instead of unnecessary and distressing routine EMB screenings. Their use can also improve therapeutic decisions and monitoring of myocardial function during anti-rejection therapy. Myocardial velocity and deformation imaging is also suited to early detection of myocardial dysfunction induced by CAV and may be useful for prognostic evaluation and timing of CAs, with an aim of reducing the number of routine CA screenings. However, further studies are necessary before specific recommendations for the use of TDI and strain imaging for CAV surveillance become possible.

Forty-seven patients died on the waiting list, resulting in mortality rates of 11.2\u00b12.7% at 1 year, 31.9\u00b15.4% at 2 years and 49.4\u00b17.1% at 3 years. Median survival was 36.0\u00b14.6 months. In the multivariable analysis, left ventricular ejection fraction<30% (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38-10.24; P=0.010) and severe right ventricular systolic dysfunction (HR: 2.89, 95% CI: 1.41-5.92; P=0.004) were associated with increased waiting-list mortality. The post-transplant survival rate was 73.1\u00b14.4% at 1 year. Pretransplant severe right ventricular dysfunction and age>50 years were strong predictors of death after transplantation (HR: 5.38, 95% CI: 1.38-10.24 [P=0.020] and HR: 6.16, 95% CI: 1.62-9.32 [P=0.0130], respectively). Mortality among candidates for heart transplantation remains high. Patients at highest risk of waiting-list mortality have to be promoted, but without compromising post-transplant outcomes. For this reason, candidates with severe right ventricular dysfunction are of concern, because, for them, transplantation is hazardous.

Transplantation of sensitized recipients has been associated with increased risk of post-transplant complications. In 2010, the Canadian Cardiac Transplant Network (CCTN) created a unique status listing for highly sensitized heart transplant candidates. Status 4S listing requires calculated panel-reactive antibody (cPRA) level >80% as the sole listing criteria and enables geographic expansion of the donor pool by providing national access. In this study, we describe patient characteristics and outcomes of those transplanted as Status 4S in Canada. Patients' characteristics and clinical outcomes were retrospectively collected from all 11 adult heart transplant centers in Canada. Ninety-six patients were listed Status 4S from January 2010 to September 2015. Fifty-two were transplanted as Status 4S. Of these 52 transplants, mean cPRA level was 93.4%, mean age was 47 years, 46% were male, 44% had dilated cardiomyopathy and 17% were re-transplanted for cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). Blood group O comprised 42% and 53% had a left ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplant. Desensitization therapy occurred in 9 patients (17%). Over a mean follow-up period of 28 months (1 week to 5.3 years), 9 patients died (17%). Kaplan-Meier 1-year year survival is 86%. Two patients were treated for antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in the first year post-transplant and 33% of patients had at least 1 ISHLT Grade \u22652R cellular rejection in the first year. Twenty-nine percent of patients developed de novo door-specific antibodies and demonstrated no correlation with AMR. Freedom from CAV at 1 year is 88.5% and at 5 years is 81.0%. Fifty-two percent of donor hearts originated from outside the recipients' geographic and organ donation organization. A national strategy of prioritizing highly sensitized heart transplant recipients has demonstrated effective expansion of the donor pool, acceptable short-term survival, freedom from CAV and low rates of clinically relevant AMR. However, we observed significantly higher rates of cellular rejection and de novo donor-specific antibody development in this population.

Here, we present approaches to personalize the care of heart transplant recipients. Four strategies for personalized posttransplant care are described, including use of pharmacogenomic data to individualize the use of immunosuppressive drugs, immune monitoring to prevent acute rejection while reducing the long-term consequences of over immunosuppression, noninvasive surveillance for acute rejection, and targeted prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. The long-term survival of heart transplant recipients is limited by side effects of immunosuppressive drugs, including infectious complications, renal dysfunction, and malignancy.

The cardiac allocation system in France is currently based on urgency and geography. Medical urgency is defined by therapies without considering objective patient mortality risk factors. This study aimed to develop a waitlist mortality risk score from commonly available candidate variables. The study included all patients, aged 16 years or older, registered on the national registry CRISTAL for first single-organ heart transplantation between January 2010 and December 2014. This population was randomly divided in a 2:1 ratio into derivation and validation cohorts. The association of variables at listing with 1-year waitlist death or delisting for worsening medical condition was assessed within the derivation cohort. The predictors were used to generate a candidate risk score (CRS). Validation of the CRS was performed in the validation cohort. Concordance probability estimation (CPE) was used to evaluate the discriminative capacity of the models. During the study period, 2333 patients were newly listed. The derivation (n =1 555) and the validation cohorts (n = 778) were similar. Short-term mechanical circulatory support, natriuretic peptide decile, glomerular filtration rate, and total bilirubin level were included in a simplified model and incorporated into the score. The Concordance probability estimation of the CRS was 0.73 in the derivation cohort and 0.71 in the validation cohort. The correlation between observed and expected 1-year waitlist mortality in the validation cohort was 0.87. The candidate risk score provides an accurate objective prediction of waitlist mortality.

We queried the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database for adults undergoing isolated HT from 2005 to 2012. Risk-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were constructed for the primary outcomes of 30-day and 1-year mortality, and the independent impact of donor distance from transplantation center at the time of procurement was assessed.

The mean distance from location of the donor heart to transplantation center was 184.4 \u00b1 214.6 miles; 1,214 HTs (8.3%) occurred at the same location as the donor heart. Ischemic times were inversely related to the distance from the site of donor procurement to recipient transplantation. After risk adjustment, longer donor distances (in miles) were associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality at both 30 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0.9993, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9988 to 0.9998, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and 1 year (HR 0.9994, 95% CI: 0.9989 to 0.9999, p\u00a0= 0.015).

Of 4,458 primary transplants in the database, there were 4,815 infections that required hospitalization or intravenous therapy, 2,047 (42.51%) of which were bacterial. The risk of bacterial infection was highest in the first month post-transplant, and the bloodstream was the most common site (24.82%). In the early post-transplant period (<30 days post-transplant), coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common pathogens (16.97%), followed by Enterobacter sp (11.99%) and Pseudomonas sp (11.62%). In the late post-transplant period, community-acquired pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae (6.27%) and Haemophilus influenzae (2.82%) were also commonly identified.

Our objective was to determine the optimal timing of transplantation for patients bridged with continuous-flow LVADs. A total of 301 HeartMate II LVADs (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA) were implanted in 285 patients from October 2004 to June 2013, and 86 patients underwent transplantation through the end of follow-up. Optimal transplantation timing was the product of surviving on LVAD support and surviving transplant. Three-year survival after both HeartMate II implantation and heart transplantation was unchanged when transplantation occurred within 9 months of implantation. Survival decreased as the duration of support exceeded this. Preoperative risk factors for death on HeartMate II support were prior valve operation, prior coronary artery bypass grafting, low albumin, low glomerular filtration rate, higher mean arterial pressure, hypertension, and earlier date of implant. Survival for patients without these risk factors was lowest when transplant was performed within 3 months but was relatively constant with increased duration of support. Longer duration of support was associated with poorer survival for patients with many of these risk factors. Device reimplantation, intracranial hemorrhage, and postimplant dialysis during HeartMate II support were associated with decreased survival. Survival of patients supported by the HeartMate II is affected by preoperative comorbidities and postoperative complications.

A total of 1,848 HTx were bridged with a VAD. A decline in post-HTx 5 years survival was noted after 14 years of age, which improved at around 30 years of age. Group 1 had 237 (13%) HTx, group 2 had 787 (43%) HTx, and group 3 had 823 (44%) HTx. Group 2 (15-29 years) had worse post-HTx survival compared with group 1 (p < 0.001) and group 3 (p = 0.005).

Multivariable inverse probability weighted Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to assess hazard ratios associated with post-transplant mortality as the primary outcome. The study cohort was censored on March 4, 2016, to allow at least 1-year of follow-up. During the study period, the number of SHKTs increased nearly 5-fold. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed superior outcomes with r-ATG compared with no induction or interleukin-2 receptor-\u03b1 induction. Compared with the no-induction group, an inverse probability weighted Cox proportional hazard model showed no independent association of induction therapy with the primary outcome. In sub-group analysis, r-ATG appeared to lower mortality in sensitized patients with panel reactive antibody of 10% or higher (hazard ratio, 0.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.71). r-ATG may provide a survival benefit in SHKT, especially in sensitized patients maintained on TAC/MPA/PRED at hospital discharge.

To determine the impact of recipient age and perioperative risk factors on midterm survival after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). The authors hypothesized that perioperative variables are more important as predictors of mortality than is a recipient's age. Retrospective study. Tertiary care university hospital. The study comprised 126 consecutive adults who underwent OHT. After Institutional Review Board approval, the authors analyzed 126 consecutive adult patients who underwent OHT between January 2009 and December 2015 and followed-up with them up until June 2016. Patients were divided into the following 2 groups according to the recipient's age at the time of transplantation: older group (\u226560 y old) and younger group (18 to 59 y). Actuarial survival rates for all patients were 88.1%, 78.6%, and 72.2% at 30 days, 1 year, and after a median follow-up of 18.9 months (midterm survival) (1st quartile: 8.1; 3rd quartile: 37.4), respectively. In the unadjusted analysis, the older group demonstrated a significant increase in 1-year mortality (p = 0.005) and a trend toward worse midterm mortality (p = 0.087). Multivariable analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Independent risk factors related to midterm mortality after OHT were as follows: preoperative relative pulmonary hypertension using the mean arterial-to-mean pulmonary artery pressure ratio \u22643 (hazard ratio [HR] 5.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.64-17.74, p = 0.006); cardiopulmonary bypass duration (per each 10-min increment) (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.08-1.22, p < 0.001); and postoperative right ventricular dysfunction (HR 3.50, 95% CI 1.52-8.05, p = 0.003).

Prolonged cold ischemia storage (CIS) is a leading risk factor for poor transplant outcome. Existing strategies strive to minimize ischemia-reperfusion injury in transplanted organs, yet there is a need for novel approaches to improve outcomes of marginal allografts and expand the pool of donor organs suitable for transplantation. Aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of water channels that facilitate homeostasis, tissue injury, and inflammation. We tested whether inhibition of AQP4 improves the survival of fully MHC-mismatched murine cardiac allografts subjected to 8\u00a0hours of CIS. Administration of a small molecule AQP4 inhibitor during donor heart collection and storage and for a short-time posttransplantation improves the viability of donor graft cells, diminishes donor-reactive T cell responses, and extends allograft survival in the absence of other immunosuppression. Furthermore, AQP4 inhibition is synergistic with cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4-Ig in prolonging survival of 8-hour CIS heart allografts. AQP4 blockade markedly reduced T cell proliferation and cytokine production in vitro, suggesting that the improved graft survival is at least in part mediated through direct effects on donor-reactive T cells. These results identify AQPs as a promising target for diminishing donor-specific alloreactivity and improving the survival of high-risk organ transplants.

Waitlist mortality is more than 12% for pediatric heart transplantation, with strikingly high rates of organ refusal, many of which are due to donor quality. However, some centers use these organs despite refusals by other centers for donor quality. We hypothesize that the number of refusals for donor quality (RDQ) does not affect pediatric heart transplantation outcomes. Pediatric heart transplants from 2000 to 2015 were identified using the United Network for Organ Sharing database and were matched against the potential transplant recipients dataset with donor refusal codes. Refusals for donor quality were counted for each organ. The population was divided into two groups: RDQ-low (0 to 3 RDQs, n\u00a0= 3,404) and RDQ-high (>3 RDQs, n\u00a0= 1,585). Posttransplant outcomes of both cohorts were analyzed. Of 4,989 pediatric heart transplants, 75% (n\u00a0= 3,770) had 1 or more RDQ (median 3 RDQ; interquartile range, 1 to 7). The RDQ-lower group (0 to 3 RDQs) and the RDQ-higher group (>3 RDQ) had similar posttransplant survival (p\u00a0= 0.41) and freedom from retransplantation (p\u00a0= 0.37). Both groups had similar posttransplant survival even for high-risk recipient cohorts: adolescents (p\u00a0= 0.06), congenital heart disease (p\u00a0= 0.87), retransplantation (p\u00a0= 0.47), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (p\u00a0= 0.61), mechanical ventilation (p\u00a0= 0.24), and poor renal function at transplant (p\u00a0= 0.46).

This study describes experiences and outcomes of HTx in TS using a unique linkage between the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and the Pediatric Health Information System databases. All pediatric HTx recipients (2002-2016) with TS were identified in the database using ICD-9 code 758.6 (gonadal dysgenesis) in conjunction with female sex. Patient characteristics and outcomes were described. Fourteen patients with TS were identified who underwent 16 HTx procedures at eight centers. For initial HTx, HLHS was the most common indication (10/14) with a median age of 10\u00a0months (IQR 3-73\u00a0months). Median transplant-free survival following initial HTx was 4.1\u00a0years (IQR 16\u00a0days-10.5\u00a0years), with all deaths occurring in the first year post-HTx. For patients that survived past 1\u00a0year (8/14), follow-up ranged from 4.1 to 10.9\u00a0years (median 8.0\u00a0years) with no deaths observed. Our cohort demonstrates that while there is a clear risk for early mortality, there is the potential for favorable outcomes following HTx in patients with TS. Therefore, TS should not be viewed as an absolute contraindication to HTx, but careful assessment of candidate risk is needed. Primary palliation with HTx for HLHS and TS may be a reasonable consideration given the poor outcomes of single ventricle palliation in this group.

Eight patients received a concomitant kidney transplant (KTx), and 15 underwent late KTx due to chronic renal failure after HTx. The mean drop in mGFR compared with the preoperative value was 12% during the first year after HTx. Preoperative mGFR was not predictive of mortality or ESRD. Older or the use of a ventricular assist device (VAD) were preoperative predictors of death. Long-term survival was significantly worse in the patients who experienced a >25% decrease in mGFR during the first year after transplantation. The need for acute postoperative renal replacement therapy (RRT) was associated with impaired survival but did not predict ESRD among survivors. On multivariable analyses, previous heart surgery, preoperative VAD, and a lower mGFR were all predictors of RRT. In the most recent period, death without previous ESRD was lower, and the only preoperative factors associated with ESRD by multivariable analyses were mechanical ventilation and diabetes mellitus. Pretransplantation mGFR was not predictive of mortality or ESRD after HTx, but necessitated simultaneous or late-stage KTx in this selected population of patients. However, patients with a decrease in >25% mGFR during the first year post-transplantation, as well as early postoperative dialysis-dependent acute renal dysfunction, had a poor prognosis.

We used available data from a national transplant registry to explore whether the association between pre-transplant transfusions and outcomes of pediatric HTx varies by patient age. De-identified data were obtained from the United Network for Organ Sharing registry, including first-time recipients of isolated HTx performed at age 0-17\u00a0years in 1995-2015.

First-year RSBMSR incidence did not differ with intensity or age at HT. Significant variability exists in RSB intensity, but with no impact on timing and incidence of RSBMSR or 4-year mortality. Reduction in RSB frequency may be safe in certain patients after pediatric HT.

Bridge to heart transplantation (HTx) with ECMO is associated with poor outcome, but patient status, according to different levels of multiorgan compromise, is generally not considered. The aim of this study was to analyze the prognostic value of acute physiology, age, and chronic health evaluation IV (APACHE IV) score in this setting. Thirty-two patients underwent HTx bridged with ECMO at our institution between 2005 and 2017; they were divided into two groups, according to a cutoff value of APACHE IV score obtained by Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for 30-day mortality. Kaplan-Meyer survival curves were plotted, and compared through the log-Rank test. Cox regression model was used to estimate which factors were associated with overall survival. The 30-day mortality prediction of the APACHE IV score showed an AUC of 0.98 [95% C.I. 0.84-0.99], with a cutoff value corresponding to a score value of 47 (specificity of 84.6% and sensitivity of 100%) in order to discriminate between a group with low probability (Group A, patients with an APACHE IV score <47), and a group with high probability (Group B, patients with an APACHE IV score \u226547) of 30-day mortality.

All deaths occurred in Group B, where 30-day mortality was 60%. Survival probability among Group B patients was 26.6% at both 1 and 5 years. Conversely, in Group A no early mortality was reported, and the estimated survival was 89.7% at 1 year and 81.5% at 5 years, respectively. Mortality correlated at univariate analysis with recipient age, APACHE IV score and female sex, while the multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that only an APACHE IV score (HR 1.23 [1.08-1.39, 95% C.I.]) and female sex (HR 6.68 [1.42-31.43, 95% C.I.]) had an adverse impact on survival.

A United Network for Organ Sharing database review. Recipient-related factors, such as education level and type of health insurance, are known to affect heart transplantation outcomes. Pre-operative employment status has shown an association with survival in abdominal organ transplant patients. We sought to evaluate the effect of work status of heart transplant (HTx) recipients at the time of listing and at the time of transplantation on short- and long-term survival. We evaluated the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry for all adult HTx recipients from 2001 to 2014. Recipients were grouped based on their work status at listing and at heart transplantation. Kaplan-Meier estimates illustrated 30-day, 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival comparing working with non-working groups. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was applied to adjust for covariates that could potentially confound the post-transplantation survival analysis. Working at listing for HTx was not significantly associated with 30-day and 1-year survival. However, 5- and 10-year mortality were 14.5% working vs 19.8% not working (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and 16% working vs 26% not working (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), respectively. Working at HTx appeared to be associated with a survival benefit at every time interval, with a trend toward improved survival at 30 days and 1 year and a significant association at 5 and 10 years. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a 5% and 10% decrease in 5- and 10-year mortality, respectively, for the working group compared with the group not working at transplantation. The Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that working at listing and working at transplantation were each associated with decreased mortality (hazard ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20090.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71 to 0.91; and HR\u2009=\u20090.76, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.89, respectively). This study is the first analysis of UNOS STAR data on recipient work status pre-HTx demonstrating: (1) an improvement in post-transplant survival for working HTx candidates; and (2) an association between working pre-HTx and longer post-HTx survival. Given that work status before HTx may be a modifiable risk factor for better outcomes after HTx, we strongly recommend that UNOS consider these important findings for moving forward this patient-centered research on work status. Working at listing and working at HTx are associated with long-term survival benefits. The association may be reciprocal, where working identifies less ill patients and also improves well-being. Consideration should be given to giving additional weight to work status during organ allocation. Work status may also be a modifiable factor associated with better post-HTx outcomes.

Frailty reflects a state of decreased physiological reserve and vulnerability to stressors. Its prevalence among patients with cardiovascular disease is as high as 60%. Frailty is associated with a poor prognosis for patients with heart failure, increasingly frequent hospitalization, and death. The recent published listing criteria for heart transplantation of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation recommend assessing frailty (class IIb recommendation, level of evidence C). However, this recommendation is not based on prospective studies, and frailty scores have only been validated in patients age\u2009>\u200965\u2009years. The aim of the FELICITAR registry (Frailty Evaluation After List Inclusion, Characteristics and Influence on Transplantation and Results) is to assess the impact of frailty on prognosis before and after heart transplantation. A series of 100 patients from 3 Spanish centers will be included as soon as they are added to the national heart transplantation waiting list. Frailty will be evaluated again every 3\u2009months until heart transplantation and at 3, 6, and 12\u2009months thereafter. Depression, cognitive assessment, and quality of life also will be analyzed. The 2 primary endpoints are all-cause mortality and prevalence of frailty assessed using the Fried frailty index. Results from this study may show that frailty is frequent in patients with advanced heart failure listed for heart transplantation and is associated with a poor prognosis both before and after surgery.

Clinical and surgical variables were analyzed. Ten patients (age 25 \u00b1 7 years old, 60% male) were analyzed, which represents 2.2% of the entire series of HT; 9 of the 10 patients were electively transplanted and 1 was under support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Compared with the rest of the transplanted patients, patients with CHD had a lower median age (25 [25-36] vs 53 [15-69]; P\u00a0< .009); more cardiac surgeries prior to HT (100% vs 14.4%; P\u00a0< .001); a lower percentage of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF; 0% vs 60%; P\u00a0< .001). The left ventricle ejection fraction also showed statistically significant differences (33.5 [12-67] vs 20 [6-70]). Our patients with CHD and HT are younger and have less CVRF and more cardiac surgeries, which highlights that it is a subgroup with clear clinical differences in its comorbidity and pretransplantation assessment. They also require longer extracorporeal circulation time, more hours of intubation, and more days in the intensive care unit. Primary graft failure is more common in patients with CHD. Therefore, survival at 1-month follow-up is lower than the rest of the series and equalizes after the year of follow-up. This long-term survival reaffirms the possibility of HT in CHD despite the fact that its postoperative period is more difficult. ", "label": 1}{"text": "Orthotopic heart transplantation in children. Heart transplantation is a relatively infrequent but technically demanding procedure in pediatric cardiac surgery. Orthotopic heart transplantation is often offered to older children or adolescents following multiple previous operations, but with advances in intensive care, diagnostics, and management, more infants with complex congenital heart diseases are being listed for transplantation. Primary cardiomyopathies remain the most common indication. Outcomes following cardiothoracic transplantation have improved steadily in recent times. Donor availability has been helped by increasing public awareness and donation after cardiac death, especially of lungs, increasing the number of patients benefiting from heart and/or lung transplantation. While there are still insufficient donors to meet the current needs, effective devices to bridge patients to transplantation are now widely used. Although the many advances have improved the outlook of transplantation, there are still difficulties that have not changed over time. Nevertheless, heart transplantation in children carries a reasonably good survival rate over the entire spectrum of recipient heart conditions.

Risk prediction is crucial in many areas of medical practice, such as cardiac transplantation, but existing clinical risk-scoring methods have suboptimal performance. We develop a novel risk prediction algorithm and test its performance on the database of all patients who were registered for cardiac transplantation in the United States during 1985-2015. We develop a new, interpretable, methodology (ToPs: Trees of Predictors) built on the principle that specific predictive (survival) models should be used for specific clusters within the patient population. ToPs discovers these specific clusters and the specific predictive model that performs best for each cluster. In comparison with existing clinical risk scoring methods and state-of-the-art machine learning methods, our method provides significant improvements in survival predictions, both post- and pre-cardiac transplantation. For instance: in terms of 3-month survival post-transplantation, our method achieves AUC of 0.660; the best clinical risk scoring method (RSS) achieves 0.587. In terms of 3-year survival/mortality predictions post-transplantation (in comparison to RSS), holding specificity at 80.0%, our algorithm correctly predicts survival for 2,442 (14.0%) more patients (of 17,441 who actually survived); holding sensitivity at 80.0%, our algorithm correctly predicts mortality for 694 (13.0%) more patients (of 5,339 who did not survive). ToPs achieves similar improvements for other time horizons and for predictions pre-transplantation. ToPs discovers the most relevant features (covariates), uses available features to best advantage, and can adapt to changes in clinical practice. We show that, in comparison with existing clinical risk-scoring methods and other machine learning methods, ToPs significantly improves survival predictions both post- and pre-cardiac transplantation. ToPs provides a more accurate, personalized approach to survival prediction that can benefit patients, clinicians, and policymakers in making clinical decisions and setting clinical policy.

A retrospective analysis of pediatric heart transplant recipients using the organ procurement and transplant network (OPTN) between 1987 and 2015 was conducted. Recipient as well as donor data were analyzed. Propensity score matching with 1:2 ratios was performed for recipient variables. Post-transplant morbidity and mortality were compared for recipients of BCPD and NBCPD. Among 9618 heart transplant recipients, 450 (4.7%) were from culture positive donors. Recipients of BCPD had longer duration of listing as Status 1; diagnosis of congenital heart disease or restrictive cardiomyopathy and required support (IV inotropes, Inhaled NO and LVAD) prior to transplant. Post-transplant survival between the 2 groups was not different.

Biopsies were graded according to the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation system, with a range of 0 to 4. Grades 0 and 1A were grouped as \"no rejection,\" and the higher grades as \"rejection.\" Linear and logistic regression, accounting for longitudinal data, were the principal analytic tools. p-Selectin level increased progressively with increasing rejection grade (P<0.001). With multivariate analysis, both p-selectin and prothrombin fragment levels significantly predicted rejection. p-Selectin levels were predictive of prothrombin fragment levels (P<0.0001) but not of d-dimer, fibrinogen, or thrombomodulin levels. This model allowed correct prediction of rejection, based on p-selectin and prothrombin fragment values, up to 85% of the time.

IFN-gamma-inducible genes are specifically up-regulated in murine cardiac allografts, suggesting that signaling mediated by IFN-gamma may play an important role in the late phase of acute rejection in vivo.

The authors report the case of a cardiac transplant patient with a recurrence of atrial flutter two months after electrical cardioversion and despite long-term preventive treatment with amiodarone. Early investigation for signs of rejection with 4 endomyocardial biopsies was negative. Aggravation of the haemodynamic status due to flutter with a rapid ventricular response led to an attempted radio-frequency ablation. Endocavitary mapping confirmed persistence of sinus activity in the native atrium and the presence of a circuit of type I isthmic flutter (anticlockwise circuit) in the donor atrium. Ablation by radio-frequency in the same procedure was successful. A fifth myocardial biopsy the same day finally confirmed stage 3A acute rejection. No signs of recurrent rejection or arrhythmia have been observed after 24 months' follow-up in this patient. This preliminary experience confirms the need to look for graft rejection by repeated myocardial biopsies in cardiac transplant, patients with atrial flutter and the efficacy of radio-frequency ablation in cases of resistance to conventional therapy.

Because of the infrequent nature of soft tissue sarcomas in general, superficial leiomyosarcomas are often misdiagnosed on clinical grounds. Immunohistochemistry is essential for an accurate histologic diagnosis, and it should include a broad panel of antibody studies. With respect to differences in clinical appearance and biologic behavior, superficial leiomyosarcomas can be broadly classified as either cutaneous or subcutaneous; local control and overall survival are significantly more favorable in patients with the former. The primary treatment of a leiomyosarcoma is a wide surgical excision with an emphasis on negative margins. Treatment failures are usually attributable to a local recurrence. Systemic metastasis occurs in about one-third of patients with subcutaneous involvement. Although cutaneous leiomyosarcoma is considered a relatively more benign process with minimal metastatic potential, systemic metastasis is still possible. This was demonstrated in our case, as a recurrent cutaneous leiomyosarcoma metastasized to the lung. Proper management requires inclusion of this entity in the differential diagnosis, as well as familiarity with its clinical behavior. In this article, we review the literature on superficial leiomyosarcoma and discuss its epidemiology, presentation, clinical behavior, evaluation, tissue diagnosis, staging, and treatment.

The correlation dimension (CD) method is related to chaos theory and is used to quantify heart rate variability (HRV). The CD is a measure for the amount of correlations present in the signal. The algorithm used to calculate the CD is based on the method of Grassberger and Proccacia. The method was first validated on signals with known CD and then applied to HRV-signals of heart transplants and an age-matched control group of healthy subjects. The CD of the corresponding surrogate time series was calculated to investigate non-linear correlations in the HRV-signal. Circadian variations of the CD were studied in 20 healthy subjects, including men and women. The value of the CD for healthy subjects ranged from 2.12 to 5.53 with a mean value of 4.32. For heart transplants, only a few time series showed a finite value of the CD that varied between 2.10 and 5.60. Also, a significant difference was found between the CD of the original and the surrogate time series in healthy subjects. The CD of women is higher than the CD of men, and this difference was more pronounced during the night than during the day. This limited study shows that the CD alone cannot be used to make a distinction between HRV-signals of healthy subjects and of heart transplants. However, there is evidence that there are non-linear correlations present in the HRV-signal and that there are significant gender and circadian differences in the CD.

The family of the atrial natriuretic peptides, proANP fragments and the active alphaANP, is strongly related to heart disease. The aim was to study in CHF subjects the relation of mdANP and NtANP with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and with other traditional medical parameters. Sixteen CHF patients (aged 51.9+/-13.7 years) and 16 healthy subjects age matched (50.8+/-5.9 years) were selected. Both NtANP and mdANP were higher in CHF patients than in healthy subjects (1436+/-288 vs. 288+/-22 pmol/l p<0.001 and 2305+/-383 vs. 423+/-65 pmol/l p<0.0001, respectively). BNP in CHF patients was 28.0+/-9 pmol/l (reference values 1.7+/-1.8 pmol/l). Both NtANP and mdANP demonstrated positive correlation with BNP, p<0.0001 and with left atrial end-systolic volume, p<0.05. BNP correlated with left ventricular mass, p<0.03.

The overexpression of the GnT-III gene in mice and pigs reduced their antigenicity to human natural antibodies, especially the Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc-R, as evidenced by immunohistochemical analysis. Endothelial cell studies from the GnT-III transgenic pigs also revealed a significant down-regulation in antigenicity, including Hanganutziu-Deicher antigen, and dramatic reductions in both the complement- and natural killer cell-mediated pig cell lyses. Changes in the enzymatic activities of other glycosyltransferases, such as alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase, GnT-IV, and GnT-V, did not support cross-talk between GnT-III and these enzymes in the transgenic animals.

The overall survival during the first year after CT was 82%. All patients, besides the immunosuppressive regimen, received antiplatelet treatment postoperatively. The prevalence of thrombotic complications was 18% (29 events in 25 patients): 21 (13%) corresponded to arterial thrombosis, mainly cerebrovascular, whereas 8 (5%) were venous thrombosis.

Coronary artery disease is the major cause of late cardiac allograft failure. However, few data exist regarding the natural history of changes in intimal and external elastic membrane (EEM) areas after heart transplantation. In 38 transplant recipients, serial intravascular ultrasound examinations were performed 3.7+/-2.2 weeks after transplantation and annually thereafter for 5 years. In 59 coronary arteries, we compared 135 matched segments among serial studies. In each segment, intravascular ultrasound images were digitized at 1-mm intervals, and mean values of EEM and lumen and intimal areas were analyzed. In the first year after transplantation, the intimal area increased significantly from 1.8+/-1.6 to 3.0+/-2.1 mm(2) (P<0.001). Subsequently, the annual increase in intimal area decreased. EEM area did not change during the first year; however, between years 1 and 3, significant expansion of EEM area occurred (15.4+/-4.6 to 17.2+/-5.4 mm(2), P<0.001). Thereafter, EEM area decreased significantly from 17.2+/-5.4 mm(2) (year 3) to 15.1+/-4.9 mm(2) (year 5, P=0.01). Different mechanisms of lumen loss were observed during 2 phases after transplantation: early lumen loss primarily caused by intimal thickening and late lumen loss caused by EEM area constriction.

Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) reverse ventricular, myocardial, and systemic abnormalities characteristic of severe heart failure (reverse remodeling). The relative contributions of hemodynamic unloading and normalized biochemical milieu to reverse remodeling are unknown. Structural and functional characteristics were measured from 53 hearts of patients undergoing transplantation without LVAD support (medical support) and 33 hearts from patients receiving a median of 46 days of LVAD support (range, 8 to 360 days). Compared with medical support alone, patients receiving LVAD support for >/=30 days had higher central venous pressures (11+/-6 versus 8+/-5 mm Hg, P=0.04), lower pulmonary artery diastolic pressures (14+/-9 versus 21+/-9 mm Hg, P=0.01), and higher cardiac outputs (5.1+/-1.6 versus 3.7+/-1.0 L/min, P<0.001).

The mechanisms that contribute to cardiac allograft hypertrophy are not known; however, the rapid progression and severity of hypertrophy suggest that nonhemodynamic factors may play a contributory role. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a cytokine produced in cardiac allografts and capable of producing hypertrophy and fibrosis; therefore, we suggest that TNF-alpha may play a contributory role. Accordingly, the aims of our study were to define the role of systemic hypertension in the development of hypertrophy, characterize the histological determinants of hypertrophy, and characterize the expression of myocardial TNF-alpha after heart transplantation. To separate the effect of hypertension from immune injury in the development of cardiac allograft hypertrophy, we measured the gain in left ventricular mass by 2D echocardiography in heart transplant recipients and lung transplant recipients who developed similar rates of systemic hypertension. The gain in left ventricular mass was 73% in heart transplant recipients and 7% in lung transplant recipients (P<0.0001). By comparing myocardial samples obtained during the first week after transplant and at 1 year, we found that there was a significant increase in total collagen content (P<0.0001), collagen I (P<0.0001), collagen III (P<0.0001), and myocyte size (P<0.0001).

Sensitization of the L(d+) transgenic mice with a Balb/c skin graft and interleukin-2 pump infusion (7 days) beginning 1 day before 2C cell injection also did not promote rejection of the native L(d+) heart.

Although poor psychological adjustment to organ transplantation appears to be a major contributor to reduced quality of life and increased physical morbidity, the prevalence and risk factors for psychiatric disorder have not been considered beyond the first 12-18 months after transplantation. The authors enrolled a representative sample of 191 heart transplant recipients in a prospective examination of the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and risk factors for DSM-III-R major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), associated adjustment disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder related to transplant (PTSD-T) during the 3 years postsurgery. Survival analysis indicates that cumulative risks for disorder onset were MDD, 25.5%; adjustment disorders, 20.8% (17.7% with anxious mood); PTSD-T, 17.0%; and any assessed disorder, 38.3%. There was only one case of GAD. PTSD-T onset was limited almost exclusively to the first year posttransplant. Episodes of MDD (but not anxiety disorders) that occurred later posttransplant (8 to 36 months postsurgery) were more likely than early posttransplant episodes to be treated with psychotropic medications. For both MDD and anxiety disorders, later episodes were less likely to be precipitated by transplant-related stressors than other life stressors. Factors increasing cumulative risk for psychiatric disorder posttransplant included pretransplant psychiatric history, female gender, longer hospitalization, more impaired physical functional status, and lower social supports from caregiver and family in the perioperative period. Risk factors' effects were additive; the presence of an increasing number of risk factors bore a dose-response relationship to cumulative risk of disorder.

The present review discusses the relaxation hastening and distensibility-increasing effects of NO in experimental preparations, in the normal human heart, in left ventricular hypertrophy of aortic stenosis, in the human allograft and in dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy.

The \"enhancement\" phenomenon evoked in rats by administration of donor lymphocytes and recipient-anti-donor-lymphocyte antibodies prior to organ transplantation brings about \"continuous alloantigen elimination\". This new concept is based on the experimental data from studies on the distribution of radiolabelled alloantigen and alloantibody in the recipient lymphoid organs and suggests that immediately after organ transplantation to the \"enhanced\" recipient, the circulating antibodies bind to the donor transplantation antigens both on endothelial cells and those shed into recipient blood circulation. The formed alloantigen-alloantibody complexes are trapped in the spleen and after opsonization and binding to the migrating splenocytes are transported to the liver for further processing. The process of continuous binding of alloantigen and elimination as alloantibody-alloantigen complexes in the lymphoid organs of the recipient prevents activation of the recipient effector cells and their migration to the graft. The organ grafts survive above 100 days. Although there is no evident rejection in the allograft itself a phenomenon of \"rejection alert\" is seen in the lymphoid tissue. The lymphocytes originating from the organ graft donor injected intravenously are rejected in the \"enhanced\" recipient spleen and nodes within 6 hours. The \"physiological\" site of elimination (rejection) of alloantigens are the lymphoid organs, as it happens with invading pathogens. The allotransplant is spared since its alloantigens are \"blocked\" by anti-donor-specific antibodies, the complexes are continuously detached and washed-off by the percolating blood and eliminated in the lymphoid tissues and liver.

Brain death was induced by inflation of a subdural balloon catheter. Loading conditions and coronary perfusion pressure were kept identical in all cross-circulated hearts throughout the experiment. Induction of brain death led to a significant hyperdynamic response in all groups, with a maximal effect by the combination of neural and humoral pathways. After the initial reaction all hemodynamic parameters returned to baseline and remained stable until the end of experiments. Even if the hearts were explanted from brain dead donors with typical hemodynamic deterioration in vivo, they showed no significant differences in comparison to the other groups including healthy controls ex vivo.

In this model plaque growth would always lead to luminal narrowing and the number and severity of angiographic stenoses would reflect the extent of coronary disease. However, histologic studies demonstrated that certain plaques do not reduce luminal size, presumably because of expansion of the media and EEM during atheroma development. This phenomenon of \"arterial remodeling\" was confirmed in necropsy specimens of human coronary arteries. More recently, the development of contemporary imaging technology, particularly intravascular ultrasound, has allowed the study of arterial remodeling in vivo.

In this study we analyzed the pathogenesis of chronic cardiac allograft rejection using an H-2 matched multiple minor histocompatibility antigen-mismatched combination, AKR (H-2k) to C3H (H-2k) recipient mice. All the cardiac allografts survived for more than 100 days but were rejected within 260 days post-transplant (n = 13; mean survival times +/- standard deviation = 189.0+/-72.0; median = 210). The heartbeats of the graft became gradually weaker throughout the duration of the rejection process. Serial histological analyses with hematoxylin and eosin, elastica van Gieson or Masson trichrome staining revealed mononuclear cell infiltration and intimal thickening (i.e. CAV) which started in most grafts at 2 weeks post-transplant. These pathological changes eventually developed to severe graft fibrosis, and the severity of these changes correlated with the deterioration of the heartbeats. Production of anti-donor antibodies in most recipients was detectable by 2 weeks post-transplant, it peaked before day 100, and subsided before rejection was complete in most grafts. Intragraft expression of IFN-gamma and IL-10 mRNA was demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction during early periods post-transplant.

Robust tolerance, in contrast, has been demonstrated with mixed chimerism regimens not only in rodents but also in large animal models, including non-human primates. Furthermore, mixed chimerism protocols have been developed that would be feasible in cadaveric, and thus in thoracic, transplantation. The induction of mixed hematopoietic chimerism is therefore an attractive experimental approach for development of clinical tolerance protocols. One of the obstacles to widespread clinical application of this concept is the remaining toxicity of the host conditioning. Recent advances, however, have led to substantially milder protocols that could become clinically acceptable in the foreseeable future.

During low-dose dobutamine infusion (8 microg/kg/min), transplant recipients exhibited a larger increase in heart rate (to 126 +/- 14 vs 87 +/- 26 beats/min, p < 0.001) and MVO2 (to 269 +/- 43 vs 233 +/- 19 J/min/100g, p < 0.05) and a smaller increase in EW (64 +/- 18 vs 72 +/- 13 J/min/100g, p < 0.05) and PVA (70 +/- 16 vs 81 +/- 13 J/min/100g, p < 0.05) than did normal volunteers. As a result, both myocardial (26 +/- 4 vs 35 +/- 4%, p < 0.05) and mechanical (23 +/- 4 vs 30 +/- 4%, p < 0.001) efficiencies were lower during dobutamine infusion in transplant recipients than in normal volunteers. During the infusion of a higher dose of dobutamine (19 microg/kg/min), the chronotropic and inotropic responses of heart transplant recipients were even more exaggerated. The fall in myocardial efficiency induced by dobutamine correlated with the increase in heart rate (r = -0.58) and could be reproduced in normal volunteers by coadministration of atropine. Transplant recipients exhibit a larger fall in contractile efficiency and a larger oxygen-wasting effect during dobutamine infusion than do normal volunteers. Because normal volunteers pre-medicated with atropine presented with a similar increase in heart rate and a similar fall in efficiency, the exaggerated energetic response of transplanted hearts to dobutamine likely resulted from the same mechanisms as their chronotropic supersensitivity, i.e., the loss of inhibitory parasympathetic innervation.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is not suitable for long-term support because of its high incidence of complications. Conversion from ECMO to ventricular assist device (VAD) is reasonable, and we have developed a simple algorithm for selecting proper VADs for these ECMO-supported patients. We converted 12 patients who were receiving ECMO support to VAD for bridge to transplantation. Group I (n = 6) was converted directly from ECMO to VAD. Group II (n = 6) underwent stage conversion. We added left atrial drainage to ECMO because of lung edema or marked left heart distension. We discontinued drainage after recovery of right heart function. Group II had more unfavorable risk factors for VAD before ECMO. Three patients (50%) in Group I received biventricular VADs. The other 3 patients were converted to left ventricular assist device (LVAD), but only 1 (16.7%) experienced successful conversion. We successfully converted 5 patients (83.3%) in Group II to LVAD without right VAD, and 4 of them could be weaned from the ventilator. The multiple-organ dysfunction score gradually improved in Group II despite additional surgery. Two patients in each group received heart transplantation and survived long term. Using a conversion protocol provides a good guideline for making decisions. According to the protocol, right heart and pulmonary function can be clearly assured before shifting to LVAD in these critical ECMO-supported patients.

With native coronary disease, intimal plaque initially accumulates at focal areas in the artery, often accompanied by compensatory vessel enlargement. With transplant coronary disease, the topography of intimal thickening and associated remodeling pattern are less studied. We studied 72 prospectively recruited transplant patients with serial intravascular ultrasound using 4.3F catheters at baseline and at 1-year follow up. We considered 175 ultrasound-recorded segments (mean, 2.4 +/- 1.1 segments per patient) exactly matched on the serial studies by both angiographic criteria and ultrasound criteria, using arterial and venous branch points, pericardium, and sinuses as anatomic landmarks. Eighty-eight segments had no donor disease, and 87 had donor disease (80 eccentric and 7 concentric intimal thickening). Progressive intimal thickening occurred in 48 segments without (55%) and 43 segments with donor disease (48%, p = NS). Thickening from segments without donor disease was mainly eccentric (81%). Thickening from segments with donor eccentric plaque was also mainly eccentric (67%, p = NS compared with segments without donor disease), with further thickening superimposed on the original plaque. Concentric intimal thickening was uncommon. Of the 58 patients who had >1 segment matched, intimal changes were discordant in 34 (59%), with progression in some and lack of progression in other segments. Total vessel area change correlated with intimal area change (r = 0.37 with a slope of 0.79, p < 0.001), including segments with (r = 0.39; slope, 0.69) and segments without (r = 0.37; slope, 1.16) donor disease. The intimal thickening of early transplant coronary disease is mainly eccentric and often discordant within each individual patient. Donor eccentric plaque often serves as a nidus for further intimal growth. The topography of intimal thickening in transplant coronary disease resembles that of native coronary disease, but the presence of a pre-existent donor plaque may impede compensatory remodeling as further intimal thickening occurs after transplantation.

It is almost impossible for us to reject organ donors or recipients with positive serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). We report our experience with HBV infection in heart transplant recipients with particular attention to outcome of recipients who were HBsAg+ or who had received donor hearts from HBsAg+ donors. We performed a retrospective review of medical records. In the study, we included 101 heart recipients with post-transplant survival of more than 6 months. According to pre-transplant HBV serology markers, we divided patients into 4 groups. Group 1 (n = 8) had been HBsAg+ at the time of heart transplantation. Of these, 6 patients had HBV reactivation in the post-transplant follow-up and needed lamivudine treatment. Complete response was achieved in all 6 patients; however, HBV recurrence occurred in 1 patient after 8 months of lamivudine treatment. The recurrence remained under partial control. Group 2 (n = 16) was HBV na\u00efve at the time of heart transplantation. Of these, 2 received HBsAg+ donor hearts under perioperative hepatitis B immunoglobulin prophylaxis. HBV infection was successfully prevented in 1 patient, but the other contracted HBV hepatitis, which was successfully treated with lamivudine. In Group 2, 10 patients received donor hearts from anti-HBs+ donors, and none contracted HBV hepatitis after transplantation. Group 3 (n = 55) had protective anti-HBs antibody at the time of heart transplantation either from previous HBV vaccination (n = 10) or from natural HGB infection (n = 45). HBsAg+ donor hearts were transplanted into 2 patients with anti-HBs from previous HBV vaccination, and into 8 patients with anti-HBs form natural HBV infection. However, none of these 10 patients who received HBsAg+ donor hearts had HBV hepatitis after transplantation. Group 4 (n = 22) was HBs-, anti-HBs-, and anti-HBc+ at the time of heart transplantation. Of these, 7 patients received HBsAg+ donor hearts. Six patients experienced no HBV hepatitis after heart transplantation, and serum HBV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the time of heart transplantation was negative in all 6 patients. One patient had HBV hepatitis after transplantation, and serum HBV DNA by PCR at the time of heart transplantation also was positive. HBV reactivation after the heart transplantation was common but usually well controlled with lamivudine treatment. Therefore, HBV carrier status should not contraindicate heart transplantation. HBsAg+ donor hearts were safely transplanted into anti-HBs+ recipients; therefore, HBsAg+ itself was not a contraindication to heart donation. Patients with HBsAg-, anti-HBs-, anti-HBc+, and negative HBV DNA in the serum by PCR could be protected from HBV infection from HBsAg+ donor hearts. However, patients with HBsAg-, anti-HBs-, anti-HBc+, and positive HBV DNA in the serum by PCR should be recognized as HBV carriers and closely followed for potential HBV flare-up after heart transplantation.

Ischemia/reperfusion injury is a major cause of transplanted heart dysfunction. Several reports have demonstrated that polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) elastase derived from the activated neutrophils might play an important role in this injury. Herein, we investigated the protective effects of PMN elastase inhibitor (ONO-5046 Na) on ischemia/reperfusion injury using a left-sided canine heterotopic heart transplantation model. We used 10 pairs of adult beagle dogs. The donor heart was transplanted heterotopically into the left thoracic cavity of the recipient without cardiopulmonary bypass. A bolus of ONO-5046 Na (10 mg/kg) was introduced intravenously to 5 recipients (group II) at 15 minutes before reperfusion and was followed by continuous infusion (10 mg/kg per hour) for 180 minutes. Five dogs (group I) did not receive ONO-5046 Na and thus served as a control. After reperfusion, we evaluated transplanted heart function and obtained blood samples from the coronary sinus over a 360-minute period. E(max) and pre-load recruitable stroke work in group II showed significantly better recovery than group I. Blood levels of PMN elastase, creatine kinase MB, lactate and inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-8) were significantly lower in group II. Depletion of myocardial concentration of adenosine triphosphate at 120 minutes after reperfusion and myocardial water content was significantly lower in group II. ONO-5046 Na, which inhibits PMN elastase, could reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury in heart transplantation. These results indicate that clinical application of ONO-5046 Na should be considered.

The incidence of pulmonary complications in heart transplant recipients has not been extensively studied. We report pulmonary complications in 159 consecutive adult orthotopic heart transplantations (OHTs) performed in 157 patients. Retrospective review of medical records. Forty-seven of 159 recipients (29.9%) had 81 pulmonary complications. Pneumonia was the most common (n = 27), followed by bronchitis (n = 15), pleural effusion (n = 10), pneumothorax (n = 7), prolonged respiratory failure requiring tracheotomy (n = 7), and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (n = 6). All patients with late-onset (> 6 months after transplantation) community-acquired bacterial pneumonia presented with fever, cough, and a new lobar consolidation on the chest radiograph, and responded promptly to empiric antibiotics without undergoing an invasive diagnostic procedure. In contrast, early-onset nosocomial bacterial pneumonias carried a 33.3% mortality rate. A positive tuberculin skin test result was associated with a significantly higher rate of pulmonary complications (62.5% vs 26.8%, p = 0.007). Lung cancer and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) developed exclusively in 6 of the 61 patients (8.1%) who received induction immunosuppression with murine monoclonal antibody (OKT3). Pulmonary complications are common following heart transplantation, occurring in 29.9% of recipients, and are attributed to pneumonia of primarily bacterial origin in one half of cases. Late-onset community-acquired pneumonia carried an excellent prognosis following empiric antibiotic therapy, suggesting that in the appropriate clinical setting invasive diagnostic procedures are unnecessary. Analogous to reports in other solid-organ transplant recipients, induction therapy with OKT3 was associated with an increased incidence of lung cancer and PTLD. Overall, the development of pulmonary complications after OHT has prognostic significance given the higher mortality in this subset of patients.

Graft vascular disease (GVD) is the most common cause of late graft failure in solid organ transplantation. Recent studies have shown good efficacy of a novel nontoxic viral-derived serine proteinase inhibitor (SERP-1) in preventing postangioplasty restenosis. The current study was designed to test whether short-term treatment with SERP-1 was effective in reducing the incidence of GVD in a solid organ transplant. Piebald-Virol-Glaxo (PVG) donor hearts were transplanted into August-Copenhagen-Irish (ACI) recipients and observed for 90 days. All recipients (n=60) were treated with microemulsion cyclosporine (CsA) 7.5 mg/kg per gavage from day 0 to day 9 and randomized into 4 groups. SERP-1 was given intravenously. Group I received CsA monotherapy; group II, CsA+SERP-1 1 ng/g (postoperative days 0-9); group III, CsA+SERP-1 10 ng/g (postoperative days 0-9); and group IV, CsA+SERP-1 10 ng/g (postoperative days 0-9, 30, and 60). Graft viability was monitored by palpation, and GVD was assessed by morphometry. Two animals in group I rejected their allografts on postoperative days 7 and 14, 1 animal in group II rejected the allograft (postoperative day 31), and none in group III and IV rejected the allografts. At 90 days postoperative, 23.8% of all coronary vessels showed evidence of GVD in group I, 18.4% in group II, 12.9% in group III, and 11.8% in group IV. The difference in incidence of GVD was significant between groups I and III (P<0.05) and groups I and IV (P<0.05). Treatment with SERP-1 was well tolerated, and all animals regained weight quickly postsurgery. Treatment of allograft recipients with SERP-1 in combination with CsA early after transplantation significantly decreases the incidence of GVD when compared to grafts treated with only CsA. These results demonstrate the clinical potential for this novel serine protease inhibitor to prevent GVD in solid organ transplantation.

In a recent single-center study, donor use of catecholamines was identified to reduce kidney allograft rejection. This study investigates the effects of donor employment of adrenergic agents on graft survival in a large data base, including liver and heart transplants. The study was based on the registry of the Eurotransplant International Foundation including 2415 kidney, 755 liver, and 720 heart transplants performed between January 1 and December 31, 1993. A total of 1742 donor record forms referring to the cadaveric donor activities in 1993 were systematically reviewed with regard to employment of adrenergic agents. Catecholamine use was simply coded dichotomously and divided into three strata according to zero, single, and combined application. Multivariate Cox regression including age, gender, cause of brain death, cold ischemia, HLA-mismatching, number of previous transplants, and urgency in liver transplants was applied for statistical analysis. Donor employment of catecholamines was associated with increased 4-year graft survival after kidney transplantation (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.74-0.98). The benefit is conferred in a dose-dependent manner and compares in quantitative terms with prospective HLA matching on class I and class II antigens (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.97). Use of norepinephrine was predictive of initial nonfunction after heart transplantation (HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.14-2.43), but did not compromise liver grafts (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.67-1.32).

The left kidney recipient rejected all residual tumoral cells after graft removal and immunosuppression discontinuation. The heart recipient died 7 months after transplantation from metastasis of a renal carcinoma.

Similar temporal expression patterns and equivalent levels of chemokine expression were observed in both syngeneic and allogeneic cardiac allografts during this time period. Expression of the neutrophil chemoattractant growth-related oncogene alpha (KC) was observed first and reached peak levels by 6 h after transplant and was followed by the monocyte/macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (JE) and then macrophage inflammatory proteins 1beta and 1alpha. Administration of rabbit KC antiserum to allograft recipients within 30 min of cardiac transplantation attenuated downstream events including intra-allograft expression of the T cell chemoattractants IFN-gamma-inducible protein-10 and monokine induced by IFN-gamma, cellular infiltration into the allograft, and graft rejection. Similarly, depletion of recipient neutrophils at the time of transplantation significantly extended allograft survival from day 8 to 10 in control-treated recipients up to day 21 after transplant.

Organ transplantation is currently a form of treatment for end-stage organ disease in Latin America for which enthusiasm appears to be growing both in individual countries as well as in the whole region. The Latin-American Transplant Registry has been a factor in the development of communication among the different countries of the region and a focus for unification. Both renal and extra-renal organ transplantation have increased significantly during 1999 and for kidneys the activity is currently 12% of the world renal transplant statistics. Important evidence for the continuing development and maturity of transplantation in the region includes the number of new transplantation societies, the increase in the number of renal and extra-renal transplant programs, the development of national organ transplant registries, efforts towards analyzing costs and administration in transplantation and the incorporation of new immunosuppressants. The development of cardiac transplantation in Bolivia, Cuba, Paraguay, Per\u00fa, Puerto Rico and Uruguay, intestinal transplantation in Argentina, and liver transplantation in Bolivia all reflect a marked interest in organ transplantation in the different countries. Similarly, liver and cardiac transplantation are increasing at a very fast rate. End-stage organ disease is recognized as a growing health priority and organ donation as a critical limiting factor.

Safety of pregnancy in the female transplant recipient population must include consideration of 3 outcomes--mother, baby and transplanted graft. In the majority of female recipients studied, pregnancy does not appear to cause excessive or irreversible problems with graft function, if the function of the transplant organ is stable prior to pregnancy. However, a small percentage of recipients identified within each organ system may develop rejection, graft dysfunction and/or graft loss that may be related to the pregnancy and may occur unpredictably. Outcomes are not entirely similar among all organ systems, and one must consider risks on an individual organ basis. It appears reasonable to advise female recipients to wait one or 2 years after transplantation before attempting pregnancy to insure that function of the transplanted organ is adequate and stable and also to allow for stabilization of immunosuppressive medications. Favorable outcomes, however, have occurred when recipients have become pregnant less than one year from transplant, so cases must be analyzed individually. Immunosuppressive medications may have to be adjusted during pregnancy, and in some cases, rejections occur requiring additional immunosuppressive regimens (steroids and in several cases OKT3). Whether increasing immunosuppressive doses during pregnancy to adjust for falling levels lessens the rejection risk has never been studied prospectively. There is concern based on animal reproductive studies that the risk of birth defects and/or spontaneous miscarriage is increased in women exposed to MMF during pregnancy. Of the 9 pregnancies reported to the registry to date, there have been no birth defects noted among 5 liveborn of female recipients exposed to MMF. Data remain limited. For female recipients, a high incidence of low birth-weight and prematurity compared to the general population has been a consistent outcome, however, there has been no specific pattern of malformation in their newborn or any apparent increase in the incidence of small-for-gestational-age newborn. Long-term follow-up of children to date by the NTPR has been encouraging. A recent report in the literature has suggested impairment of immune function in newborn of CsA-treated mothers. Further study is needed. Some mothers have chosen to breastfeed. The potential risk to the newborn of ingested immunosuppressives compared with the potential benefits of breastfeeding is unknown and options must be discussed with the recipient. From earlier registry reports, recipients with deteriorating graft function, such as liver recipients with recurrent hepatitis C and/or other recipients with deteriorating graft function, appear to be at risk for worsened graft function with pregnancy. Outcomes of male recipient fathered pregnancies have been favorable and appear to be similar to the general population, but this group has not been as well studied as female recipients. No structural problems have been noted in the 38 offspring of males on MMF at the time of conception. Within each organ group, some female recipients have reported more than one pregnancy, sometimes on differing immunosuppressive regimens. If there is stable graft function, additional successful pregnancies are possible.

Contractions of isolated myocytes (1.2 mM Ca2+; 37 degrees C) were assessed during field stimulation (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Hz), and papillary muscle contractions were assessed during direct stimulation (2.0 mM Ca2+; 37 degrees C; 0.5 Hz). Hemodynamic unloading was associated with a 41% decrease in median myocyte volume and proportional decreases in myocyte length and width. Nevertheless, atrophic myocytes had normal fractional shortening, time to peak contraction, and relaxation times. Despite decreases in absolute maximal force generation (F(max)), there were no differences in F(max)/ area in papillary muscles isolated from unloaded transplanted hearts. Therefore, atrophic remodeling after unloading is associated with intact contractile function in isolated myocytes and papillary muscles when contractile indexes are normalized to account for reductions in cell length and cross-sectional area, respectively. Nevertheless, in the absence of compensatory increases in contractile function, reductions in myocardial mass will lead to impaired overall work capacity.

Virus- and nonvirus-mediated immunosuppressive cytokine gene therapy prolongs cardiac allograft survival in various nonfunctional heart transplant animal models, but its cardiac adverse effects have not been addressed. Recently, we developed a functional heterotopic heart transplant model in rabbits. For the first time, we were able to systematically compare the efficiency, efficacy, and adverse effects of optimized adenovirus- and liposome-mediated ex vivo interleukin (IL)-10 gene transfer in functional donor hearts. The efficiency of liposome-mediated gene transfer was greatly improved in physiologically functioning donor hearts and was only three- to fourfold lower than adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. The efficacy of liposome-mediated IL-10 gene transfer was much higher than that mediated by adenovirus. Significant negative inotropic and arrhythmogenic adverse effects on transplanted hearts were observed due to viral cytotoxicity and immunogenesis, which greatly abated the therapeutic efficacy of this first generation adenovirus-mediated gene therapy.

Acute cardiac allograft rejection continues to be the cause of graft loss and contributes to the morbidity and mortality after cardiac transplantation. In this study, we report a new method for detecting organ rejection in transplantation with an MR-based technique using dextran-coated ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particles. These particles ( approximately 27 nm in diameter) are known to shorten relaxation times in MRI experiments. A new rat model of heterotopic heart and lung transplantation has been developed for MRI experiments. Allotransplantations (DA-->BN) were performed (n=8), with syngeneic transplantations (BN-->BN) serving as controls (n=8). MR images were obtained with a gradient echo method. At postoperative day 7, allotransplants developed moderate rejection as determined histopathologically. A significant reduction in MR signal intensity was observed after USPIO injection into rats with allotransplanted hearts. Syngeneic transplants showed no differences in MR signal intensity before and after USPIO injections. After injection of USPIO particles at postoperative day 6, a group of allotransplanted rats was treated with cyclosporin A (3 mg/kg). Animals treated with cyclosporin A for 7 days showed no reduction in MR signal intensity after USPIO reinjection at day 14, whereas animals treated for 4 days showed a significant decrease in MR signal intensity in the transplanted hearts indicative of acute graft rejection. Pathological analysis of these animals revealed that dextran-coated USPIO particles were taken up by the infiltrating macrophages that accumulated within the rejecting cardiac graft. This MRI method offers promise as a noninvasive method for detecting transplant allograft rejection.

This study compared the TIMI frame count (TFC), which has been proposed as a method for quantifying coronary blood flow, with coronary flow and microvascular function measured with intracoronary Doppler and intracoronary ultrasound. Coronary blood flow volume was calculated from coronary blood velocity (by intracoronary Doppler) and lumen area (by intracoronary ultrasound) in the LAD in 46 post-heart transplant patients at baseline and after intracoronary adenosine. TFC correlated significantly with average peak coronary blood velocity (r = -0.42; P = 0.004) and coronary lumen area (r = 0.39; P = 0.008), but not with coronary blood flow volume (r = -0.01; P = 0.96) or the coronary flow reserve response to adenosine (r = 0.09; P = 0.58). In conclusion, TFC is a simple method of assessing coronary blood velocity but not volumetric flow. While TFC does not predict coronary flow reserve, as a measure of velocity it does provide an assessment of basal microvascular tone, information that is complementary to that afforded by flow reserve measurements.

Following orthotopic heart transplantation (HTx), development of transplant vasculopathy (TVP) is the limiting medical entity leading to significant morbidity and mortality beyond the first year after HTx. Selection of a suitable strategy for repeat revascularisation--transcatheter angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting or repeat HTx--depends on various parameters including coronary morphology, left ventricular performance, comorbidity, availability of graft material and donor organs. Catheter-based interventions on the main stem of the left coronary artery are feasible, but a relatively lower primary success rate and a higher complication rate and significantly increased mortality have to be expected. We report on a patient who underwent HTx 9 years ago and developed severe transplant vasculopathy revealing significant main stem stenosis, making reintervention necessary. Due to age, coronary artery morphology and comorbidity the patient was not considered for coronary artery bypass grafting or repeat HTx. We performed successful IVUS-guided directional coronary atherectomy and stent implantation on a distal stenosis of the unprotected main stem. Our case demonstrates a predictable procedural risk and favourable primary result of left main stem angioplasty procedures, thus providing a therapeutic option for patients who are poor candidates for operative revascularisation strategies.

Constantly changing practices in heart transplantation have improved posttransplant survival in patients with end-stage heart disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate long-term outcomes in different eras of immunosuppressive therapy after cardiac transplantation at a single center during a two-decade period. A retrospective review of 1,086 consecutive cardiac allograft recipients who underwent transplantation between 1977 to 1999 was performed. Patients were divided into four eras based on type of immunosuppressive therapy: era 1 = steroids, azathioprine (n = 26, February 1977 to March 1983), era II = steroids, cyclosporine (n = 43, April 1983 to April 1985), era III = cyclosporine, steroids, azathioprine (n = 752, April 1985 to December 1995), era IV = cyclosporine, steroids, mycophenolate mofetil (n = 315, January 1996 to October 1999). The actuarial survival of the entire cohort of 1,086 patients undergoing cardiac transplantation was 79%, 66%, and 49% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. There were significant trends in recipient age and gender distribution among the four eras with increasing proportion of older age (> 60 years) and female recipients in eras III and IV (p = 0.001 and 0.02). Early mortality and long-term survival improved significantly over all eras (p < 0.001). Rejection as a cause of death decreased over time (era I, 24%; era II, 21%; era III, 15%; era IV, 9%; p = 0.02), whereas the contribution of transplant coronary artery disease as a cause of death remained unchanged. Cardiac transplantation provides satisfactory long-term survival for patients with end-stage heart failure. The improving outcomes in survival correlate with improved immunosuppressive therapy in each era. Although the reasons for improvement in survival over time are multifactorial, we believe that changes in immunosuppressive therapy have had a major impact on survival as evidenced by the decreasing number of deaths due to rejection.

In this study we investigated whether a disturbance in microcirculation is detectable in heart recipients with cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) and severe hypercholesterolemia (n = 11) and in 7 heart recipients without CAV in comparison to patients with severe coronary artery disease (n = 49) and age-matched apparently healthy subjects (n = 100). For this purpose, the flow velocity of erythrocytes through cutaneous capillaries at the nail fold of the finger was measured under resting conditions. In addition, reactive hyperemia in the same capillaries after a 3-min ischemia was determined. Patients with CAV and severe lipid disorder showed a pathological reduction in mean capillary erythrocyte velocity under resting conditions with v(RBC) = 0.10 +/- 0.07 mm/s. The latter was significantly and relevantly lower than in patients with coronary three-vessel disease (v(RBC) = 0.46 +/- 0.35 mm/s). It was notable that under resting conditions temporary cessation of flow occurred in 8 of the 11 patients which did not occur in healthy subjects and rarely in patients with three-vessel disease (1 of 49 patients). In comparison to age-matched healthy subjects (v(max) = 1.46 +/- 0.52 mm/s), the patients with three-vessel disease showed a significant reduction in postischemic maximum erythrocyte velocity (v(max) = 0.85 +/- 0.55 mm/s), with a considerable shortening of the duration of reactive hyperemia. Patients with CAV demonstrated a total loss of postischemic reactive hyperemia (only 1 of the 11 patients presented a weak reactive hyperemia).

Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is the major limitation to survival after lung transplantation. Acute rejection, its main risk factor, is characterized by perivascular/bronchiolar leukocyte infiltration. BOS is characterized by persistent peribronchiolar leukocyte recruitment leading to airway fibrosis and obliteration. The specific mechanism(s) by which these leukocytes are recruited are unknown. Because MCP-1, acting through its receptor CCR2, is a potent mononuclear cell chemoattractant, we hypothesized that expression of this chemokine during an allogeneic-response promotes persistent recruitment of leukocytes and, ultimately, rejection. We found that elevated levels of biologically active MCP-1 in human bronchial lavage fluid (BALF) were associated with the continuum from acute to chronic allograft rejection. Translational studies in a murine model of BOS demonstrated increased MCP-1 expression paralleling mononuclear cell recruitment and CCR2 expression. Loss of MCP-1/CCR2 signaling, as seen in CCR2(-/-) mice or in WT mice treated with neutralizing antibodies to MCP-1, significantly reduced recruitment of mononuclear phagocytes following tracheal transplantation and led to attenuation of BOS. Lymphocyte infiltration was not reduced under these conditions. We suggest that MCP-1/CCR2 signaling plays an important role in recruitment of mononuclear phagocytes, a pivotal event in the pathogenesis of BOS.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a heart muscle disease of unknown etiology characterized by the peculiar right ventricular (RV) involvement. Distinctive pathologic features are myocardial atrophy and fibro-fatty replacement of the RV free wall, and clinical presentation is usually related to ventricular tachycardias with a left bundle branch block pattern or ventricular fibrillation leading to cardiac arrest, mostly in young people and athletes. Later in the disease evolution, progression and extension of RV muscle disease and left ventricular involvement may result in right or biventricular heart failure. The diagnosis of ARVC may be difficult because of several problems with specificity of ECG abnormalities, different potential etiologies of ventricular arrhythmias with a left bundle branch morphology, assessment of RV structure and function, and interpretation of endomyocardial biopsy findings. Therefore, standardized diagnostic criteria have been proposed by the Study Group on ARVC of the European Society of Cardiology. According to these guidelines, the diagnosis of ARVC is based on the presence of major and minor criteria encompassing electrocardiographic, arrhythmic, morphofunctional, histopathologic, and genetic factors. Since the assessment of sudden death risk in patients with ARVC is still not well established, there are no precise guidelines to determine which patients need to be treated and what is the best management approach. The therapeutic options include beta-blockers, antiarrhythmic drugs, catheter ablation, and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). The ICD is the most effective safeguard against arrhythmic sudden death. However, its precise role in changing the natural history of ARVC by preventing sudden and nonsudden death needs to be evaluated by a prospective study of a large series of patients. In patients in whom ARVC has progressed to severe RV or biventricular systolic dysfunction with risk of thromboembolic complications, treatment consists of current therapy for heart failure including anticoagulant therapy.

In the present study, the incidence of TxCAD assessed by both yearly coronary angiography and stress myocardial scintigraphy imaging was reviewed. Ninety-nine consecutive primary heart transplantations were performed from 1988 to 1999. The standard immunosuppression protocol consisted of the introduction of antilymphocyte globulin and steroids, while maintenance therapy was with cyclosporine, imuran and steroids. Coronary angiography and a stress 2-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile perfusion scan were performed yearly. TxCAD was defined by angiographic evidence of luminal abnormality by catheterization, or a perfusion abnormality at rest or after stress on myocardial scintigraphy. The mean recipient age was 49+/-12 years and the mean donor age was 33+/-13 years. The etiology of heart failure was ischemic cardiomyopathy (50%), dilated cardiomyopathy (41%) and congenital heart disease (9%). The freedom from angiographic TxCAD was 92% at one year, 64% at five years and 35% at eight years. The freedom from nuclear imaging TxCAD was 92% at one year, 69% at five years and 44% at eight years. However, a diagnosis of TxCAD by angiography only correlated with a diagnosis of TxCAD by nuclear imaging 52.8% of the time in the same patient, with a median time between studies of one month.

Peak exercise oxygen consumption (peak VO2) is an important discriminator of survival in patients with systolic heart failure and is used to select ambulatory patients for transplantation.

It is unknown how peak VO2 measured in this patient population by the more vigorous Bruce treadmill protocol compares with that obtained on less intense protocols. We studied 15 patients (50 +/- 12 years old) with severe heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction 23.5% +/- 8.6%). Patients randomly performed 3 exercise tests with the Bruce treadmill, modified Naughton treadmill, and modified bicycle protocols within 14 days. To determine the ability of this patient population to perform the Bruce protocol, we also retrospectively analyzed the ability of 84 patients to perform this test on their initial evaluations at our center. All patients reached the anaerobic threshold (AT) on all 3 protocols.

Peak VO2 and VO2 at AT on both treadmill protocols were higher than those obtained with bicycle testing (15.3 +/- 3.1 and 11.8 +/- 3.0 mL/kg/min, P <.05). Exercise duration was shorter with the Bruce and bicycle protocols (6.2 +/- 2.2 and 6.7 +/- 2.4 minutes, respectively) compared with the modified Naughton protocol (9.7 +/- 4.3 minutes, both P <.005).

This study was designed to assess the association between 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibition, coronary endothelial function and cytokine activation in heart transplant recipients without angiographically detectable disease. Coronary endothelial dysfunction contributes to cardiac allograft vasculopathy. The vasoprotective effects of statins in heart transplant recipients may include restoration of endothelial function and suppression of allograft inflammatory activity. Heart transplant recipients (one to three years after heart transplant) were divided into three groups based on the total cholesterol levels: group 1 (n = 21), patients with a history of hypercholesterolemia adequately controlled with simvastatin; group 2 (n = 19), patients with hypercholesterolemia not adequately treated with simvastatin; and group 3 (n = 40), patients without hypercholesterolemia. Coronary vasomotor function and intimal thickness as well as coronary sinus and aortic cytokine concentrations (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, interleukin [IL]-6 and soluble IL-2 receptor) were investigated. In a prospective one-year follow-up study, changes in coronary endothelial function and cytokine levels were compared between 11 hypercholesterolemic patients treated with simvastatin and 9 controls. Epicardial and microvascular endothelial functions were better in groups 1 and 3 than they were in group 2 (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05). Transcardiac IL-6 and TNF-alpha gradients were significantly increased in groups 2 and 3 compared with group 1 (IL-6: p < 0.05; TNF-alpha: p < 0.01). Plaque areas were significantly increased in groups 1 and 2 (p < 0.05 vs. group 3), whereas lumen area was increased in group 2 compared with group 1 (p < 0.05), demonstrating adaptive vascular remodeling. In patients treated with simvastatin, coronary endothelial function and cardiac cytokine activity significantly improved during the one-year follow-up. Inhibition of allograft inflammatory activity and attenuation of the coronary endothelial dysfunction observed in cardiac transplant recipients during treatment with simvastatin may represent an important mechanism by which HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors protect against the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy.

In the 1970s, clinical trials were started transplanting kidneys of subgroup A2 into blood group O recipients. The tissues of the A2 subgroup expresses reduced amount of A antigens compared to subgroup A1 and the recipients had no special pretreatment and standard immunosuppression. A number of early graft losses were experienced but the trial also resulted in several long time surviving grafts. A few centres have adapted the concept of A2 to non A kidney transplantations with successful results, when the recipient anti-A titres are low or reduced prior to transplantation. In the early 1980s one group successfully transplanted A1 and B kidneys from living related donors across the ABO-barrier using an immunosuppressive protocol consisting of quadruple drugs and splenectomy and this protocol was adapted by a few other groups.

CX(3)CR1(-/-) mice were phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type mice in a pathogen-free environment. In response to antibody-induced glomerulonephritis, CX(3)CR1(-/-) and CX(3)CR1(+/+) mice had similar levels of proteinuria and injury.

Intra-allograft expression of Mig was observed at day 2 posttransplant and increased to the time of rejection at day 7 posttransplant. IP-10 mRNA and protein production were 2.5- to 8-fold lower than Mig. Whereas allografts were rejected at day 7-9 in control recipients, treatment with rabbit antiserum to Mig, but not to IP-10, prolonged allograft survival up to day 19 posttransplant. At day 7 posttransplant, allografts from Mig antiserum-treated recipients had marked reduction in T cell infiltration. At the time of rejection in Mig antiserum-treated recipients (i.e., days 17-19), intra-allograft expression of macrophage-inflammatory protein-1alpha, -1beta, and their ligand CCR5 was high, whereas expression of CXCR3, the Mig receptor, was virtually absent. Mig was produced by the allograft endothelium as well as by recipient allograft-infiltrating macrophages and neutrophils, indicating the synergistic interactions between innate and adaptive immune compartments during acute rejection. Collectively, these results indicate that Mig is a dominant recruiting factor for alloantigen-primed T cells into cardiac allografts during acute rejection. Although Mig antagonism delays acute heart allograft rejection, the results also suggest that the alloimmune response circumvents Mig antagonism through alternative mechanisms.

Recipient pulmonary hypertension due to chronic congestive heart failure is a major cause of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction after heart transplantation. We hypothesized that inhaled nitric oxide (NO), in the postoperative period, would a) selectively reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and improve RV hemodynamics and b) reduce the incidence of RV dysfunction compared with a matched historical group. Sixteen consecutive adult heart transplant recipients with lowest mean pulmonary artery (PA) pressures >25 mmHg were prospectively enrolled. Inhaled NO at 20 parts per million (ppm) was initiated before termination of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). At 6 and 12 hours after CPB, NO was stopped for 15 minutes and systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics were measured. RV dysfunction was defined as central venous pressure >15 mmHg and consistent echocardiographic findings. The incidence of RV dysfunction and 30-day survival in this group was compared with a historical cohort of 16 patients matched for pulmonary hypertension. Discontinuation of NO for 15 minutes at 6 hours after transplantation resulted in a significant rise in mean PA pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and RV stroke work index. Systemic hemodynamics were not affected by NO therapy. One patient in the NO-treated group, compared with 6 patients in the historical cohort group, developed RV dysfunction (P< .05).

In this study, we examined plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL) 10, and their relations to antioxidant vitamins in 45 HTx recipients before and after treatment with omega-3 fatty acids or placebo. The patients were long-time survivors of heart transplantation, randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive omega-3 fatty acids (3.4 g/day) or placebo for 1 year. Plasma levels of cytokines were measured by enzyme immunoassays and vitamin A, vitamin E, and beta-carotene by high-performance liquid chromatography. In the omega-3, but not in the placebo group, there was a rise in the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha (P<0.05), a decrease in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (P=0.07), and a rise in TNF/IL-10 ratio (P<0.05) after 12 months, suggesting a proinflammatory net effect. In the omega-3 group, the increase in TNF-alpha was associated with an increase in eicosapentaenoic acid in plasma (r=0.58, P<0.02). During omega-3 fatty-acid treatment, but not during placebo, there was a decrease in vitamin E (P<0.05) and beta-carotene (P<0.05) levels, and the decrease in vitamin E was inversely correlated with the increase in TNF-alpha (r= -0.56, P<0.01). The rise in TNF-alpha levels during omega-3 fatty acids treatment was most pronounced in those patients with transplant coronary artery disease (P<0.04). Our data suggest that omega-3 fatty acids in HTx recipients may change the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in an inflammatory direction, possibly related to prooxidative effects of these fatty acids.

Studies in animal models and patients have suggested that 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) may be useful in diagnosing transplant rejection, but such studies often are confounded by the late inclusion of patients after transplantation. The present study examined the utility of 31P-MRS in the diagnosis of acute allograft rejection during the first posttransplant month. Thirteen recent heart transplant recipients underwent 57 resting 31P-MRS studies within 24 hr of a biopsy. Subjects lay supine with a 10-cm surface coil placed over the heart. A 1-dimensionsal chemical shift imaging protocol was used to collect spectral information. Spectra from the heart were weighted for distance from the coil and summed before analysis. ANOVA and Duncan's multiple range test were used to analyze the data comparing phosphocreatine (PCr)/ATP ratios with biopsy scores. Transplant patients had significantly lower myocardial PCr/ATP ratios when compared with a normal control group (1.27 +/- 0.27 versus 1.61 +/- 0.22, p < 0.001). However, when the patient group was classified by biopsy score, the expected order of score, 0 > 1 > 2 > 3, was not obtained. Rather, the order was 2 > 0 > 1 > 3. Although the difference between scores 2 and 3 was significant (1.46 versus 1.14, alpha = 0.05 level), the lower three groups were statistically indistinguishable. In addition, the PCr/ ATP ratios were not predictive of future biopsies. Although significantly lower than normal control subjects, resting myocardial PCr/ATP ratios of transplant subjects are not useful in assessing thelevel of rejection. It is suggested that the measurement may be more predictive in mildly exercised myocardium. ", "label": 0}{"text": "Magnetic resonance spectroscopy in human cardiomyopathies.

Mechanical circulatory support may be a life-saving measure by allowing an interval for return of native ventricular function in the majority of these patients or by providing a bridge to transplantation in the remainder. A retrospective chart review of 15 children with viral myocarditis supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (12 patients) or ventricular assist devices (3 patients) was performed. All patients had histories and clinical findings consistent with acute myocarditis. The median age was 4.6 years (range 1 day-13.6 years) with a median duration of mechanical circulatory support of 140 hours (range 48-400 hours). Myocardial biopsy tissue demonstrated inflammatory infiltrates or necrosis, or both, in 8 (67%) of the 12 patients who had biopsies. Overall survival was 12 (80%) of 15 patients, with 10 (83%) survivors of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and 2 (67%) survivors of ventricular assist device support. Nine (60%) of the 15 patients were weaned from support, with 7 (78%) survivors; the remaining 6 patients were successfully bridged to transplantation, with 5 (83%) survivors. All survivors not undergoing transplantation are currently alive with normal ventricular function after a median follow-up of 1.1 years (range 0.9-5.3 years). Eighty-percent of the children who required mechanical circulatory support for acute myocarditis survived in this series.

Combined heart-kidney transplantation with allografts from the same donor has been long proved to be a feasible approach for selected patients with coexisting end-stage cardiomyopathy and renal disease. The purpose of this retrospective study is to analyze our long-term results and compare these results with heart-only transplantation over a 7-year period. Between June 1992 and April 1999, 10 patients underwent combined heart-kidney transplantation at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. They were all men from 44 to 70 years old (mean age, 59 +/- 8.3 years) who had a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 19.4% +/- 5.0% (range, 9%-25%) and a mean creatinine clearance of 25.4 mL/min (range, 10-39 mL/min). Four patients underwent pretransplantation dialysis. There was no operative mortality. The actuarial survival at 1, 2, and 5 years was 100%, 88% +/- 11.7%, and 55% +/- 20.1%, respectively. By comparison, the operative mortality of 169 patients who underwent heart-only transplantation during the same time interval was 2.4%, with an actuarial survival at 1, 2, and 5 years of 92% +/- 2.1%, 84% +/- 2.8%, and 71% +/- 3.9%, respectively (P =.37). Eight patients showed no evidence of significant (> or =1B) cardiac allograft rejection postoperatively, and the actuarial freedom from rejection at 30 days, 1 year, and 2 years was 90% +/- 9%, 80% +/- 13%, and 80% +/- 13%, respectively. Renal allograft survival was 90% at 1 and 2 years. Combined heart-kidney transplantation yields satisfactory long-term results similar to those for heart-only transplantation, with a low incidence of cardiac allograft rejection and renal allograft survival when both allografts are from the same donor. This approach effectively expands the selection criteria for heart-only and kidney-only transplantation in potential candidates with coexisting end-stage cardiac and renal disease.

Improved methods of cardiac allograft protection are required to expand the pool of potentially available organs and to enhance the recovery of grafts subjected to prolonged ischemia. We have previously demonstrated that limited coronary perfusion provided by donor blood harvested at the time of organ procurement can improve both metabolic and functional recovery after transplantation. In this study we evaluated the hypothesis that limited coronary perfusion may enable prolonged cardiac storage while avoiding the potentially detrimental effects of profound hypothermia. Fourteen orthotopic cardiac transplants were performed in female Yorkshire pigs by using donor blood perfusion during 5 hours of either tepid (25 degrees C) or cold (4 degrees C) storage. Assessments of myocardial metabolism and function were performed at baseline and after 45 minutes of normothermic (37 degrees C) reperfusion. Hearts protected with tepid perfusion displayed improved recovery of myocardial function (89% +/- 18% vs 63% +/- 25%, P =.05). Diastolic compliance was adversely affected in both groups after transplantation. Aerobic myocardial metabolism was better preserved in the tepid group. Profound hypothermia results in depressed myocardial metabolic and functional recovery after transplantation. Limited coronary perfusion with shed donor blood can permit cardiac allograft storage at tepid temperatures, resulting in improved myocardial performance.

Late after cardiac transplantation, limited reinnervation of the transplanted heart may occur, but little is known about the effect of reinnervation on cardiac function and exercise performance. We quantified the extent of myocardial reinnervation noninvasively in 29 cardiac-transplant recipients, using positron-emission tomography and the catecholamine analogue [11C]hydroxyephedrine. Global and regional ventricular function at rest and during standardized exercise testing were measured with the use of radionuclide angiography, and the results were compared with those in 10 healthy controls. Sympathetic reinnervation, mainly in the anteroseptal wall, was present in 16 of the 29 transplant recipients. At rest, hemodynamic differences were not observed between the patients with reinnervation and those with denervation. However, the latter group had a shorter mean (+/-SD) exercise time (6.1+/-1.5, minutes vs. 8.2+/-1.2 in the group with reinnervation; P<0.01) and a lower peak heart rate (121+/-13 vs. 143+/-15 beats per minute, P<0.01). The contractile response to exercise was significantly enchanced in transplant recipients with reinnervation and similar to that of normal controls. In a multivariate analysis, hydroxyephedrine retention was the only independent determinant of the exercise-induced increase in the ejection fraction. In heart-transplant recipients, the restoration of sympathetic innervation is associated with improved responses of the heart rate and contractile function to exercise. These results support the functional importance of reinnervation in transplanted hearts.

During periods of acute rejection, transplanted hearts have increased nitric oxide (NO) production and depressed contractile function. Myocytes isolated from rejecting hearts exhibit parallel increases in NO production and reduced shortening, indicating that the contractile dysfunction of the transplanted heart is intrinsic to the myocytes. We tested the hypothesis that the contractile dysfunction of the rejecting heart is due to an NO-mediated inhibition of the L-type calcium current. Ventricular myocytes isolated from rejecting rat hearts (allografts) expressed inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and produced substantially more NO than did myocytes isolated from non-rejecting rat hearts (isografts). Aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of iNOS, reduced NO production by allograft myocytes, but was without effect on NO production by isograft myocytes. In the absence of exogenous l -arginine (the precursor of NO), the calcium current was identical in allograft and isograft myocytes. In the presence of l -arginine, the calcium current was reduced in allograft myocytes compared to isograft myocytes. Superfusion of the myocytes with either aminoguanidine or KT5823 (an inhibitor of the cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase) reversed the depression of the calcium current in allograft myocytes, but neither inhibitor had an effect on calcium current in isograft myocytes. These results indicate that increased production of NO by myocytes isolated from rejecting hearts leads to a reduction in the calcium current. This mechanism may contribute substantially to the contractile dysfunction of rejecting transplanted hearts.

Hence, WF10 may prove useful to prolong graft survival after transplantation. In this study, we evaluated the use of high dose WF10 as a single drug regimen in the hamster-to-rat xenotransplantation model and searched for possible cardiotoxic side effects. WF10 prolonged cardiac xenograft survival, but did not induce tolerence or inhibit pathological signs of acute rejection. Hamsters from the donor population, receiving high dose WF10 for 5 days, were compared with a matched control group. Ultrastructural examination of cardiac tissue as well as biochemical analysis of the cardiac enzymes troponin I, myoglobin and MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase showed no signs of damage.

It has been observed that opposite changes in cardiac workload result in similar changes in cardiac gene expression. In the current study, the hypothesis that altered gene expression in vivo results in altered substrate fluxes in vitro was tested. Hearts were perfused for 60 minutes with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing glucose (5 mmol/L) and oleate (0.4 mmol/L). At 30 minutes, either insulin (1 mU/mL) or epinephrine (1 micromol/L) was added. Hearts weighed 35% less after unloading and 25% more after aortic banding. Contractile function in vitro was decreased in transplanted and unchanged in banded hearts. Epinephrine, but not insulin, increased cardiac power. Basal glucose oxidation was initially decreased and then increased by aortic banding. The stimulatory effects of insulin or epinephrine on glucose oxidation were reduced or abolished by unloading, and transiently reduced by banding. Oleate oxidation correlated with cardiac power both before and after stimulation with epinephrine, whereas glucose oxidation correlated only after stimulation. Malonyl-coenzyme A levels did not correlate with rates of fatty acid oxidation. Pyruvate dehydrogenase was not affected by banding or unloading. It was concluded that atrophy and hypertrophy both decrease insulin responsiveness and shift myocardial substrate preference to glucose, consistent with a shift to a fetal pattern of energy consumption; and that the isoform-specific changes that develop in vivo do not change the regulation of key metabolic enzymes when assayed in vitro.

One hundred twelve consecutive transplanted patients were studied retrospectively to determine the influence of trans-pulmonary gradient of >12 mm Hg and pulmonary vascular resistance of >2.5 Wood units, at baseline or after vasodilator test, on early mortality. A multivariate analysis was used to study the hemodynamic parameters associated with early mortality. The pulmonary pressures of all surviving patients were studied for up to 3 years after surgery. Early mortality in the groups with and without pulmonary hypertension were 24.4% and 5.6%, respectively (p =.009). The only variable that was independently associated with early mortality was the pulmonary vascular resistance index (odds ratio = 1.459). Mild pulmonary hypertension disappeared 1 year after heart transplantation. Mild pulmonary hypertension is a risk factor for early postoperative mortality. The hemodynamic parameter most closely associated with early mortality is pulmonary vascular resistance index. The hemodynamic profile of pulmonary circulation after heart transplantation is partially dependent on the level of pulmonary hypertension before transplantation, at least during the first year after surgery.

We measured the plasma concentrations of ANP and BNP in patients supported by various ventricular assist devices (VADs) at various times. We analyzed the time courses of ANP and BNP to determine (1) the time scale of their down-regulation as a marker of putative myocardial recovery, (2) their steady-state levels under VAD support and (3) differences caused by various VAD devices.

In contrast, patients supported by THO or LIO did not reveal a determined time course of the natriuretic hormones. Only a few patients reached normal plasma values during VAD support.

This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. We assigned 31 transplant recipients to either pyridoxine (n = 11:100 mg/day), folate (n = 12:5 mg/day), or placebo (n = 8) for 10 weeks.

In this study, we applied ex vivo 31P MRS of the entire heart to study the effects of BD on the energy status of the feline donor heart following explantation. We used cats (6 BD and 6 controls [C]) in a 26-hour protocol. After 2 hours of preparation, we induced BD by filling an intracranial balloon at t = 0 hour. At t = 6 hours, the hearts were arrested with St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution, explanted, and stored in the same solution at 4 degrees C in a 4.7 Tesla magnet for 17 hours. Subsequently, the hearts were reperfused in the Langendorff mode at 38 degrees C for 1 hour. The first 5-minute 31P MRS spectrum was obtained 1 hour after crossclamping the aorta; we obtained subsequent spectra every hour during storage and every 5 minutes during reperfusion. At the end, the hearts were dried and weighed. Phosphocreatine (PCr), gamma-adenosine triphosphate (gamma-ATP), inorganic phosphate (Pi), and phosphomonoesters (PME), were expressed per g dry heart weight. The intracellular pH (pH(i)) and the PCr/ATP ratio were calculated. During storage, we identified a significant but similar decrease of pH(i), PCr/ATP ratio, and PCr in both groups. During reperfusion, pH(i) and PCr/ATP ratio recovered similarly in both groups, whereas the recovery of PCr in the BD group was significantly lower (p < 0.05). The Pi and PME increased in both groups during storage but to a lesser extent in the BD group (p < 0.05). This difference disappeared during reperfusion.

Implantable left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are used as a bridge to transplantation but are associated with a high risk of infection including nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSI). We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients with implantable LVAD at the Cleveland Clinic with 72 hours or longer of LVAD support from January 1992 through June 2000, to determine the attack rate, incidence, and impact of nosocomial BSI in patients with LVAD. A nosocomial BSI was defined using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition. An LVAD-related BSI was defined as one where the same pathogen is cultured from the device and the blood with no other obvious source. Two hundred fourteen patients were included in the study (17,831 LVAD-days). One hundred forty BSI were identified in 104 patients for an attack rate of 49% and incidence of 7.9 BSI per 1000 LVAD-days. Thirty-eight percent of the BSI were LVAD associated. The most common pathogens causing BSI were coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 33), Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida spp. (19 each), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 each). A Cox proportional hazard model found BSI in patients with LVAD to be significantly associated with death (hazard ratio = 4.02, p < 0.001). Fungemia had the highest hazard ratio (10.9), followed by gram-negative bacteremia (5.1), and gram-positive bacteremia (2.2). Patients with implantable LVAD have a high incidence of BSI, which are associated with a significantly increased mortality. Strategies for prevention of infection in LVAD recipients should focus on the drive line exit site until technical advances can achieve a totally implantable device.

The effectiveness of donor-specific blood transfusion (DST) before transplantation has been established. Anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (anti-CD4) augments the ability of DST to induce indefinite prolongation. Therefore, we investigated the importance of thymus to maintain the unresponsiveness to alloantigens. CBA mice were pretreated with 0.25 mL of DST or two doses of anti-CD4 before transplantation of a C57BL/10 heart. Some mice were thymectomized. Naive CBA mice rejected C57BL/10 grafts acutely with a median survival time of 7 days. When mice were pretreated with anti-CD4 plus DST 4 weeks before transplantation, all grafts survived indefinitely (>100 days), whereas mice treated with DST alone or anti-CD4 alone rejected acutely (median survival time, 7 and 12 days, respectively). To investigate the importance of thymus, mice pretreated with anti-CD4 plus DST 4 weeks before transplantation were thymectomized or underwent a sham operation 1 day before grafting. Mice with the sham operation accepted grafts indefinitely, whereas thymectomized mice rejected the majority of the grafts (median survival time, 20 days). The thymus is important in maintaining the operational tolerance induced by anti-CD4 plus DST 4 weeks before grafting.

The shortage of human hearts remains a major barrier to the efficacy of heart transplantation for the treatment of end-stage heart disease. One potential solution to the supply problem would be the use of hearts from nonhuman donors (xenografts). We have established a model of mouse to rat xenogeneic bone marrow chimerism, and in this study we have hypothesized that such chimeric rats will accept both donor and recipient specific heart grafts while rejecting third-party mouse and rat grafts. We also investigated humoral responses in naive and chimeric rats with and without donor murine cardiac grafts. Recipient Lewis rats (n = 22) were given 1100 cGy lethal total body irradiation and the same day received 300 x 10(6) donor B10.BR mouse bone marrow cells intravenously. Peripheral blood of surviving rats (n = 18) was typed at 4 weeks and then monthly thereafter. Donor and recipient specific and third-party heterotopic heart transplantations were performed at 6 to 8 weeks after reconstitution with bone marrow. Multilineage bone marrow chimerism was produced in all experimental animals with complete replacement of recipient marrow by donor cells. Murine donor and rat recipient strain hearts transplanted in chimeric rats survived indefinitely. Third-party rat and mouse hearts were rejected, though at a slower rate than bone marrow matched naive controls. High levels of antimouse antibodies were detected in rats with rejected hearts. These antibodies were absent in chimeric animals with long-term surviving heart grafts. Long-term multilineage bone marrow chimerism can be produced in a mouse --> rat bone marrow transplant model. Long-term survival of donor specific and recipient specific vascularized cardiac grafts can be produced in these chimeric animals. These animals are clinically normal but show signs of subclinical immunosuppression regimen as they reject third-party hearts later than naive animals. Our results suggest that antibodies also play a significant role in concordant xenograft rejection, and induction of bone marrow chimerism can overcome this barrier.

The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) effectively reduces sudden cardiac death in patients with severe LV dysfunction. Effect of ICD therapy on total mortality in patients on the waiting list for cardiac transplantation is still uncertain. We retrospectively analyzed 854 unselected consecutive patients (ICD therapy, n=102; 11.9%) on the waiting list for cardiac transplantation between January 1992 and March 2000. Actuarial 12-month total mortality rate on the waiting list was 24.2%; sudden cardiac death was the predominant mode of death (66.7% of total deaths). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed improved survival for ICD (total mortality, 13.2%) compared with non-ICD (total mortality, 25.8%) patients (log rank, P=0.03). No event of sudden death occurred in ICD patients, whereas in non-ICD patients, 12-month sudden death rate was 20.1% (P=0.0001). Nonsudden death rates did not differ between ICD and non-ICD patients (P=0.16). A Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated that absence of an ICD was a powerful independent predictor of total mortality (P=0.02; relative risk, 2.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.16 to 4.17) and sudden cardiac death (P<0.0001; infinite relative risk) on the waiting list.

Invasive screenings at predefined time intervals for acute rejection and transplant coronary artery disease (TxCAD) are standard procedures. However, cardiac biopsies and catheterizations are distressing and risky for the patients and are also costly. We assessed the reliability of pulsed-wave tissue Doppler imaging (PW-TDI) for the timing of invasive examinations in heart recipients in an attempt to avoid unnecessary endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) and catheterizations. PW-TDI obtained at the basal left ventricular posterior wall before 408 EMBs and 293 catheterizations was tested for its diagnostic value regarding rejection and TxCAD with the use of International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation biopsy grading, coronary angiography, and intravascular ultrasound as standards. Early diastolic peak wall motion velocity and relaxation time showed high sensitivities for clinically relevant rejection diagnosis (90.0% and 93.3%, respectively). The negative and positive predictive values for rejection of diastolic parameter changes appeared high enough (up to 96% and 92%, respectively) to allow a reliable noninvasive PW-TDI monitoring with efficiently timed, instead of routinely scheduled, EMBs. At definite cutoff values for systolic parameters, the probability for TxCAD reached 92% to 97%. The Fisher classification functions allowed TxCAD exclusion with 80% probability. Without diastolic parameter changes, acute rejection can be practically excluded, and serial PW-TDI can save patients from routine EMBs. The high specificity and negative predictive value for TxCAD of reduced systolic peak velocities and extended systolic time allow optimized timed catheterizations. Peak systolic velocity and systolic time allow diagnostic classifications that enable patients without known TxCAD but with high risk for catheterization to be spared routine angiographies.

We evaluated PCT as a predictor of early graft failure-related mortality after HTx. PCT and C-reactive protein (CRP) serum concentrations were measured in samples collected immediately before pericardium opening from 81 consecutive brain-dead multiple-organ donors. Donors for high-urgency-status recipients (n=2) were excluded from analysis. The remaining donors were retrospectively divided into 2 groups: donors for recipients who died within 30 days after HTx, after an early graft failure (group II, n=8), and all other donors (group I, n=71). No differences in donor and recipient demographic characteristics were found between groups. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for graft failure-related mortality were 0.71 for PCT and 0.64 for CRP. A PCT value >2 ng/mL as a predictor of graft failure-related mortality had a specificity of 95.8% and sensitivity of 50.0%. The odds ratio for graft failure-related mortality for recipients of hearts from donors with PCT levels >2 ng/mL was 22.7 (unadjusted, 95% CI 3.7 to 137.8, P=0.0007) and 43.8 (after adjustment for prespecified potential confounders, 95% CI 1.4 to 1361.0, P=0.031).

Oxidative stress after ischemia/reperfusion of cardiac allografts leads to cytokine production. Bcl-2, an inhibitor of apoptosis, also has strong antioxidant properties. Caspase-3 is known to cleave bcl-2. This study tests the hypothesis that bcl-2 is downregulated while tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels increase after cardiac transplantation. Furthermore, the use of caspase-3 inhibition was investigated as a strategy for preserving myocardial bcl-2 and mitochondrial cytochrome c after transplantation. PVG-to-ACI rat heterotopic cardiac transplantations were performed in 4 groups designed with 30 minutes' ischemia and 4 or 8 hours of reperfusion (n=4 per group). Treatment consisted of DEVD-CHO 500 microgram IP per animal to donor and recipient 2 hours before transplantation and 250 microgram IC into allograft. Controls were treated with saline. Grafts were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for bcl-2 mRNA, by ELISA for TNF-alpha, for myeloperoxidase activity, and by Western blot for cytochrome c. In untreated groups, bcl-2 mRNA decreased significantly over time, whereas TNF-alpha increased significantly at 4 hours (P=0.003) and returned to baseline after 8 hours' reperfusion (P=NS compared with normal hearts). Treatment with caspase-3 inhibitor showed significant upregulation of bcl-2 mRNA expression after 4 and 8 hours of reperfusion (P<0.001 versus control), with a concomitant decrease in TNF-alpha to baseline levels. Myeloperoxidase activity in all groups was no different from that of normal hearts. Mitochondrial cytochrome c release increased in both control and treatment groups. Bcl-2 is actively downregulated and TNF-alpha is upregulated in this model of cardiac allograft ischemia/reperfusion. Furthermore, the caspase-3 pathway is linked to this process, and blockade of caspase-3 can ameliorate reperfusion injury by upregulating bcl-2 and inhibiting TNF-alpha without affecting cytochrome c release.

Skeletal myoblast transplantation is promising for the treatment of end-stage heart failure. Direct intramyocardial injection is useful for local cell delivery but may not be effective in global dissemination of cells into the heart, which would be advantageous in treating generalized cardiac dysfunction as in dilated cardiomyopathy. We hypothesized that intracoronary infusion of myoblasts would disseminate cells more effectively, leading to functional improvement in global heart failure. Heart failure was induced by the intraperitoneal administration of doxorubicin (total dose 15 mg/kg) in rat. One million primary skeletal myoblasts were then infused via the coronary arteries of an excised, failing doxorubicin-treated heart. After incubation under increased intracoronary pressure, the hearts were subsequently transplanted into syngeneic recipients. For the control group, doxorubicin-treated hearts were infused with medium only and transplanted. Four weeks after transplantation, Langendorff perfusion demonstrated that both maximum dP/dt (2797.6+/-103.3 versus 2326.9+/-133.1 mm Hg/s, P=0.01) and minimum dP/dt (-2067.4+/-88.1 versus -1718.8+/-91.3 mm Hg/s, P=0.02) were improved in myoblast-transplanted hearts compared with medium-infused hearts. This was associated with a sharper slope of the left ventricular developed pressure-volume curve and a reduced slope of the end-diastolic pressure-volume relation in the myoblast-transplanted hearts. Immunohistochemistry for skeletal myosin heavy chain showed that globally disseminated myoblasts had survived and differentiated into multinucleated myotubes that had aligned with the cardiac fiber axis within host myocardium. No significant myocardial infarction was observed.

Adenosine (Ado) triggers numerous protective mechanisms in the heart that may attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury in cardiac grafts. We aimed to establish whether sustained increase in endogenous Ado production by the combined application of Ado metabolism inhibitors and nucleotide precursors attenuates reperfusion injury in transplanted hearts. Rat hearts were collected after the infusion of St Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution, stored at 4 degrees C for 4 hours, and heterotopically transplanted into the abdomen of recipient rats. A solution containing Ado deaminase inhibitor erythro-9(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine, Ado kinase inhibitor 5'-aminoadenosine, and nucleotide precursors adenine and ribose was administered at the time of reperfusion in the treated group, whereas saline was administered to control animals. After 1 or 24 hours, mechanical function of the transplanted hearts was evaluated in an ex vivo perfusion system followed by the determination of myocardial ATP with related metabolites and measurement of the activity of neutrophil-specific enzyme myeloperoxidase in cardiac homogenates. After 24 hours of reperfusion, maximum left ventricular developed pressure increased from 87.0+/-6.8 mm Hg (mean+/-SEM) in controls to 118.1+/-8.2 mm Hg in the treated group (P<0.05), ATP increased from 11.0+/-0.8 micromol/g dry wt in controls to 15.1+/-1.2 micromol/g dry wt in the treated group (P<0.01), and myeloperoxidase activity decreased from 2.23+/-0.60 U/g wet wt in controls to 0.58+/-0.12 U/g wet wt in the treated group (P<0.001). No differences in cardiac function, ATP, or myeloperoxidase activity were observed between the treated group and controls after 1 hour of reperfusion. The administration of Ado metabolism inhibitors with nucleotide precursors causes a sustained increase in endogenous Ado production and exerts a potent protective effect against reperfusion injury in transplanted hearts. Improved cardiac function and elevated ATP concentration were accompanied by complete amelioration of neutrophil infiltration in treated hearts, suggesting that reduction in postischemic inflammation could be an important mechanism of this protective effect.

We studied the role of HSP70 overexpression through gene therapy on mitochondrial function and ventricular recovery in a protocol that mimics clinical donor heart preservation. Hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-liposome technique was used to transfect isolated rat hearts via intracoronary infusion of either the HSP70 gene (HSP group, n=16) or no gene (CON group, n=16), which was heterotopically transplanted into recipient rats. Four days after surgery, hearts were either perfused on a Langendorff apparatus for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C (preischemia studies [n=8/group]) or perfused for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C, cardioplegically arrested for 4 hours at 4 degrees C, and reperfused for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C (postischemia studies [n=8/group]). Western blotting and immunohistochemistry confirmed HSP70 upregulation in the HSP group. Postischemic mitochondrial respiratory control indices (RCIs) were significantly better preserved in HSP than in CON hearts: NAD(+)-linked RCI values were 9.54+/-1.1 versus 10.62+/-0.46 before ischemia (NS) but 7.98+/-0.69 versus 1.28+/-0.15 after ischemia (P<0.05), and FAD-linked RCI values were 6.87+/-0.88 versus 6.73+/-0.93 before ischemia (NS) but 4.26+/-0.41 versus 1.34+/-0.13 after ischemia (P<0.05). Postischemic recovery of mechanical function was greater in HSP than in CON hearts: left ventricular developed pressure recovery was 72.4+/-6.4% versus 59.7+/-5.3% (P<0.05), maximum dP/dt recovery was 77.9+/-6.6% versus 52.3+/-5.2% (P<0.05), and minimum dP/dt recovery was 72.4+/-7.2% versus 54.8+/-6.9% (P<0.05).

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays a role in mediating acute inflammation during ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in the heart, which leads to both necrosis and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) is known to inhibit the effects of IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, resulting in attenuated inflammatory injury, and to protect cells from IL-1beta-induced apoptosis in vitro. We hypothesized that IL-1ra overexpression would provide cardioprotection by reducing inflammation-mediated myocardial damage including apoptosis after I/R injury in vivo. Rat hearts were transfected with human secreted-type IL-1ra gene by intracoronary infusion of Hemagglutinating Virus of Japan liposome and were heterotopically transplanted. IL-1ra overexpression in these hearts was confirmed by enzyme immunoassay and immunohistochemistry. Myocardial tolerance of the transplanted heart was evaluated with the use of a novel system in which the heart, existing within the recipient's abdomen, was given 30 minutes of ischemia by left coronary artery occlusion and 24 hours of reperfusion. Consequently, infarct size was decreased in IL-1ra-transfected hearts compared with control-transfected ones (26.9+/-3.2% versus 46.2+/-3.0%, P=0.001), corresponding to lower myocardial myeloperoxidase activity (2.20+/-0.69 versus 6.82+/-1.19 U/g wet wt, P<0.001) and decreased neutrophil infiltration in histological study. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling and DNA-laddering studies demonstrated that cardiomyocyte apoptosis was attenuated in IL-1ra-transfected hearts (21.4+/-3.3 versus 41.4+/-3.4%, P=0.002), correlating with reduced post I/R upregulation of Bax, Bak, and caspase-3. IL-1ra introduced by gene transfection protected myocardium from I/R injury by attenuating the inflammatory response, which was associated with decreased apoptosis. This suggests a potentially important role of IL-1/IL-1ra in myocardial I/R injury and the value of IL-1ra-gene therapy for myocardial preservation.

Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is expressed and is functionally active in the presence of transplant arteriosclerosis. However, the early involvement of iNOS in alterations of microvascular endothelial function in the absence of preexisting lesions remains unclear; this information would be of prognostic value. We studied the course of iNOS mRNA expression, transcardiac nitric oxide production, and their potential association with microvascular coronary endothelial dysfunction in human cardiac allografts. A total of 42 patients were studied at 1, 6, and 12 months after heart transplantation. Microvascular coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) was tested in an endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and -independent manner (adenosine) using a Doppler flow wire. Endomyocardial iNOS expression was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. iNOS protein and nitrotyrosine levels were detected by immunohistochemistry. Transcardiac plasma nitrite/nitrate (NOx) levels were measured by the Griess reaction. CFVR was impaired in 26.1% of patients (n=11) at 1 month and in 31% of patients (n=13) at 12 months after heart transplantation. Patients who developed impaired CFVR in the first year showed a significant increase in iNOS gene expression. Patients with impairment of CFVR 1 month after heart transplantation had higher levels of iNOS mRNA than patients with a normal CFVR. Patients with an initial impairment of CFVR who did not improve over time presented with significantly higher iNOS mRNA levels. iNOS protein and nitrotyrosine were expressed in the endomyocardial vessels of patients with impaired CFVR. Transcardiac NOx release was higher in patients with impaired CFVR. In human cardiac allografts, microvascular endothelial dysfunction is associated with an enhanced endomyocardial iNOS mRNA expression and higher transcardiac NOx production and is accompanied by the expression of nitrotyrosine protein, suggesting peroxynitrite plays a role in the disease process. The data from the present study suggest an important role for the iNOS/nitric oxide pathway in the regulation of microvascular function in the absence of preexisting atherosclerotic lesions.

Subsequent oral administration of cyclosporine precipitated no reaction. The purpose of this study was to attempt to ascertain the mechanism responsible for the anaphylactic reaction. Hypersensitivity investigations, including total serum IgE and allergen-specific IgE quantifications, skin testing, and basophil activation tests by flow cytometric determination of CD63 upregulation were undertaken in the study patient and in two healthy control subjects who were free of medication. The results of intradermal testing with Cremophor EL were positive after 15 minutes in the study patient only. Both cyclosporine and Cremophor EL induced considerable activation of the basophils from our study patient, with an upregulation of CD63 expression from 1% to 39% and 55%, respectively. In contrast, the expression of CD63 on basophils from the two control subjects remained essentially unchanged. The negative investigative findings in the control subjects, the patient's clinical manifestations in temporal relationship to the infusion, her positive results on intradermal testing with Cremophor, the basophil activation test results, and her uneventful course after oral administration of cyclosporine strongly support the presence of IgE antibodies to Cremophor EL in our patient.

A critical role for the terminal components of complement (C5b-C9) has been demonstrated previously in acute allograft rejection with the use of C6-deficient PVG congenic rat strains. The C6 deficiency prevents the formation of membrane attack complex (MAC) by C5b-C9. Hearts transplanted from PVG.1A (RT1a) rats are rejected acutely (7-9 days) by fully MHC-incompatible C6-sufficient PVG.1L (RT11) recipients, but they survive significantly longer in untreated C6-deficient PVG.1L recipients (19 to >60 days). To investigate the contribution of MAC to chronic rejection and accelerated graft arteriosclerosis (AGA) in long-term cardiac allografts, hearts were transplanted heterotopically from PVG.1A donors to C6-sufficient and C6-deficient PVG.1L hosts that were treated with cyclosporine 15 mg/kg/day for 14 days after cardiac grafting. Alloantibody responses in hosts were measured by flow cytometry at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after transplantation. Vigorously contracting grafts were removed at 60 days (n=5) and at 90-128 days (n=12) after surgery for morphological evaluation. Computerized planimetry measurements were made in complete cross-sections of grafts on all assessable arteries larger than 16 microns in diameter. The survival of most (six of seven) cardiac allografts in C6-deficient recipients was prolonged by cyclosporine treatment to greater than 90 days. In contrast, 14 of 25 hearts that were transplanted to C6-sufficient recipients were rejected between 21 and 84 days with severe vascular injury. AGA, defined as smooth muscle cells forming a neointima inside the internal elastic lamina and luminal compromise, affected a greater percentage of arteries in C6-sufficient than in C6-deficient recipients. AGA developed earlier and more frequently in arteries of medium (<100 micron) diameter than those of large diameter in both C6-sufficient and C6-deficient recipients. Serial sections demonstrated the lesions in medium arteries to be located adjacent to the smooth muscle sphincters at the junction of arteriolar branches.

The relative contribution of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in promoting the rejection or acceptance of experimental cardiac allografts remains controversial. We hypothesized that the posttransplantation induction of a new immune response to graft alloantigens at a distant delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) site would force the immune system to reveal its current disposition toward graft alloantigen as it initiates the new immune response. Thus, we should be able to monitor the evolution of the immunologic relationship between allograft recipients and their grafts at any time posttransplantation by challenging the recipient for DTH responses to donor alloantigen and evaluating the cytokine profiles displayed at the DTH site. We have used the sensitive and quantitative technique of real-time polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the patterns of donor alloantigen-induced cytokine mRNA production for interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-gamma, IL-4, IL-10, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. We evaluated cytokine mRNA expression in cardiac allografts and in donor alloantigen-challenged DTH sites in mice that have either accepted or rejected cardiac allografts. We observed the following. (1) Normal hearts and pinnae exhibited detectable baseline production of cytokine mRNAs: TGF-beta>IFN-gamma=IL-10>IL2->IL-4. (2) Both the accepted and rejecting cardiac allografts produced increased amounts of all cytokine mRNAs tested and displayed few quantitative differences in cytokine mRNA production. Notably, accepted allografts displayed enhanced IL-10 mRNA production on day 7 posttransplantation, but not on day 60 posttransplantation and reduced IFN-gamma mRNA production on day 60, but not day 7. (3) There was a high degree of variability in production levels among the various cytokine mRNAs, both for background levels and for allograft-stimulated levels. (4) Donor-reactive DTH sites of allograft rejector mice displayed a broad array of cytokine mRNAs, whereas the DTH sites of allograft acceptor mice displayed only IL-4 mRNA production. (5) Provision of exogenous TGF-beta or IL-10 at a DTH challenge site of allograft rejector mice caused a shift in the cytokine mRNA profile that minimized IFN-gamma and IL-2 mRNA production but spared IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-beta mRNA production. A broad array of cytokine mRNAs may be stockpiled for future use in cardiac allografts, regardless of whether the grafts will be accepted or rejected. This stockpile is continuously replenished for as long as the graft survives, thereby obscuring any changes in immune disposition of the graft recipient toward graft alloantigens. However, such changes can be revealed by challenge with donor alloantigens at a distant site (DTH challenge). In allograft acceptor mice, this disposition evolves from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory.

Since a lot of the literature on cardiac storage is generated in the laboratory, we were particularly interested to evaluate to what extent bench work finds its way into and clinical practice. The discussion focuses in addition to new areas of research and introduces the concept of integrated organ preservation. Five representative journals (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg, Circulation, J Heart Lung Transplant, Eur J Cardio-thorac Surg and Ann Thorac Surg) were searched by hand for papers published between 1980-1999. All laboratory, animal experimental and clinical studies focused on prolonged cardiac preservation and storage were selected. Two hundred and forty-nine publications were identified using preset criteria. Of these, 196 (79%) were studies performed in animal models and 10 (4%) were experiments carried out on animal tissue. One hundred and five experiments (42% of all studies) were performed in small animals. The most common animal model was of ischemia followed by ex vivo reperfusion (121 studies, 49% of publications). The measures of outcome were classified as biochemical, functional, morphologic and endothelial; the majority of studies had one (48%) or two (40%) end-points. Twenty-five studies (10%) had endothelial measures of outcome, alone or in combination with other types of outcomes. Human clinical work was represented by 34 (14%) studies of clinical transplantation and nine (4%) experiments on human tissue only. There were five randomized clinical trials, representing 2% of all papers and 15% of all clinical research. In conclusion, most of the surgical publications on prolonged cardiac preservation result from animal research. Small animal models of ex vivo ischemia and reperfusion are predominant.

In spite of the high prevalence of Pneumocystis carinii (PC) pneumonia in immunocompromised patients, little is known about the epidemiological characteristics of this infection, and whether the cases of PC pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients are the result of a reactivation of a latent infection or a due to a recent infection is unknown. The aim of this study was to provide information about the epidemiological characteristics of PC pneumonia in a cohort of heart transplant (HT) recipients when compared with the epidemiology of PC infection in a cohort of chronic sputum producers (CSP) representative of the general population of the same geographical area. We identified all the cases of PC pneumonia in the cohort of 72 subjects who underwent cardiac transplantation at our institution between January 1991 and December 1996 and compared them with the cases of PC infection identified in a non-selected cohort of 34 CSP. This second group was included to obtain an approximation of the frequency of PC carriers in the general population. Identification of PC was accomplished through customary stain techniques and immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies. Of the 72 HT recipients four (5.5%) developed PC pneumonia, but one had two episodes. Only one had received primary chemoprophylaxis, but developed PC pneumonia 2 months after discontinuing prophylactic therapy. PC pneumonia episodes were produced 53, 102, 230, 181 and 772 days after the moment of transplant, respectively. PC was identified in two (5.8%) of the 34 CSP. No significant differences were found when the accumulative incidences of PC pneumonia in HT patients and PC infection in CSP were compared (P=0.7). The frequency of PC pneumonia among HT patients is the same as the frequency of PC infection in the general population. This observation and the long interval between transplantation and the development of PC pneumonia observed in the study support the hypothesis that the occurrence of PC pneumonia in immunocompromised patients might be from a new infection rather than from the reactivation of latent organisms. Therefore, continuous prophylaxis might be indicated in areas with a high prevalence of PC for patients at highest risk.

Therapy combining with FK506 and cobra venom factor prolongs graft survival. The proposed underlying mechanism holds that cytoprotective proteins such as Bcl-2 play a role here. We studied the effects of gene transfection of human-bcl-2 on graft survival and coronary artery lesions in concordant cardiac xenografts, and discuss the role of cytoprotective genes in vascular xenograft rejection. Golden-Syrian-hamster hearts were heterotopically transplanted into Lewis rats given FK506 (1 mg/kg daily) and cobra venom factor (0.2 mg/kg; day 0 and 1) intramuscularly. They were divided into 2 groups--grafts transfected vector with the human-bcl-2 gene (Group-B(+)) and vector without the gene (Group-B(-)) using the HVJ liposome method; 4 or 5 grafts from each group were explanted 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks and more than 1 month after transplantation and evaluated by H-E, Elastic-Van-Gieson and immunohistochemical staining of Bcl-2. Coronary arterial lesions were examined using a scoring method. Bcl-2 expression in endothelial cells in Group-B(+) was confirmed within 2 weeks after transplantation but not thereafter. The coronary score in Group-B(+) was significantly lower than that in Group-B(-) within 2 weeks after transplantation but not thereafter. In this hamster-to-rat cardiac xenograft model, the bcl-2 gene was successfully transfected to the coronary endothelium and lasted 2 weeks.

ACUTE REJECTION: Endomyocardial biopsy is the most reliable method to detect acute rejection but is an invasive procedure. Other non-invasive methods have been proposed including tissular Doppler ultrasonography with analysis of the posterior wall velocity and teletransmitted study of the intramyocardial amplitude of the QRS complex. Adding plasmapheresis to the conventional treatment is helpful in improving survival and reducing the incidence of late coronary disease after severe acute reflection. Plasmapheresis also has a preventive effect as do certain inductors such as anti-thrombocyte globulin (ATG). Opportunistic infections are the leading cause of mortality in the year following heart transplantation, generally related to the hypogammaglobulinemia. Intravenous immunoglobulins have helped reduce the frequency of infections. More than 1/3 of donor cancers diagnosed after transplantation will be transmitted to the cardiothoracic organ recipient. Melanoma, choriocarcinoma and renal carcinoma with vascular effraction are the most transferable tumors. Survival at 5 years is lower in heart transplant recipients but at 10 years the incidence of coronary artery disease and infection are the same. However at 10 years, creatininemia is higher as is the frequency of lower limb arteropathies. RHABDOMYOLYSIS: The incidence of rhabdomyolysis after heart transplantation in patients treated with statin is much higher than in the general population, but complementary studies are needed to compare the muscular effects of the different statins in transplant recipients. Coronary artery disease of the graft is the leading cause of late mortality. The known risk factors can be limited by normalizing blood pressure and lipidemia and using ATG to prevent rejection. GROWTH OF THE GRAFT IN CHILDREN: Growth of the graft has been demonstrated in 17 recipients aged less than 13 years at the time of transplantation. Growth was linear and followed the child's weight and height curves. Ultrasound measures normalized 6 months after transplantation. PREGNANCY: The graft continues to function normally in female heart transplant recipients during pregnancy and post-portum. Complementary studies are needed to determine the long-term effect.

We investigated the prognostic value of 99mTc-Tetrofosmin myocardial SPECT (99mTc-TF) in dysfunctional multivessel coronary disease patients who underwent revascularization (RV) or only medical treatment (MT). In 78 coronary patients with 2-3 diseased vessels and left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) <= 40% (24 10%), we have assessed the extension of the stress perfusion defect, and percent of reversibility (R) by quantification of stress-rest myocardial SPECT 99mTc-TF bull's eyes (2 days-protocol), lung/heart ratio (LH) calculated in the original stress SPECT images, and EF by equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography obtained at 24 h. A R value >= 8% was used to identify viable (V) patients. A total of 28 patients underwent RV and 50 only received MT. After a mean follow-up of 22.9 20 months (3-60), they were considered as coronary events (CE): cardiac death, non-fatal infarction and heart transplant. CE rate was 20.5% (16/78). No significant differences were found in the pre-revascularization study characteristics, except a significantly higher mean R value in RV (10.6 9.5%) than in MT patients (6.4 7.8%) p: 0.03, and the main difference was that RV patients showed less CE 2/28 (7%) than the MT group 14/50 (28%) p: 0.02. The CE rate was lower in V patients who underwent RV (6%) than in V patients with MT (45%) p: 0.03, but no significant difference was obtained in non-V patients between RV (7%) and MT (16%) groups. In viable patients, the corresponding survival curves (Kaplan-Meier) showed a CE-free survival at 5 years of 79% in patients RV and of 42% in MT patients, p: 0.03, without significant difference in non-V patients. Patients with viable myocardium by myocardial SPECT have a good prognosis after revascularization, and show higher risk of CE if they are only medically treated. Myocardial viability is an indispensable assessment in prognosis evaluation and, above all, in therapeutic decision making in dysfunctional multivessel coronary disease patients.

RAD is a potent immunosuppressive agent that has been shown to be effective in preventing acute and chronic allograft rejection in animal models. The HMGCoA reductase inhibitors have been found to reduce the incidence of graft vascular disease (GVD) in heart transplant patients and in animal models. This study was designed to investigate the effects of fluvastatin or pravastatin in a rodent model of GVD produced using low doses of RAD to prevent acute rejection. Hearts from Fisher 344 rats were heterotopically transplanted to Lewis rat recipients. RAD was administered orally at 0.5 mg/kg per day for days 0 to 14 and then 0.25 mg/kg per day for an additional 85 days to prevent acute rejection but allow for the development of GVD. Pravastatin (20 mg/kg per day) or fluvastatin (2 or 6 mg/kg per day) was added to the RAD treatment. At the end of a 100-day treatment period, the hearts were harvested for morphometric and histopathologic examinations. Rats treated with fluvastatin, at either dose, had a significant (P< or =0.0239) decrease in coronary arterial intimal thickening (GVD) of approximately 43%. Rats treated with pravastatin had a 22% reduction in GVD that did not reach statistical significance. Treatment with fluvastatin, but not pravastatin, decreased the degree of endomyocardial mononuclear cell infiltration seen with RAD administered alone. Fluvastatin significantly decreased GVD in a rat model produced using low-dose RAD immunosuppression. To a lesser extent, pravastatin also decreased GVD in this model. These data lend further support for the study of fluvastatin, pravastatin, and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for the prevention of GVD in cardiac transplant patients.

Little is known about the long-term impact of cardiac transplantation on activity and modifications of endothelin (ET)-1 system, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and mitochondrial metabolism and morphology in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) versus dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of ET-1, endothelin converting enzyme (ECE)-1, VEGF-C, carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT)-1, and carnitine acetyltransferase (CARAT), as well as the number of normal, edematous, and degenerated mitochondria were assessed in left ventricular biopsies of 21 patients with DCM and 20 with ICM (New York Heart Association class III-IV) before and up to 3 months after cardiac transplantation. Cardiac samples of donated, nonfailing hearts served as controls (n=10). In cardiac biopsies of both ICM and DCM patients, ET-1, VEGF-C, CPT-1, and CARAT mRNA were up-regulated, whereas ECE-1 mRNA was down-regulated (P<0.05). Degenerated mitochondria had the highest number in both groups, followed by normal and edematous mitochondria. After cardiac transplantation, in ICM patients impaired gene expression levels decreased to, or below, normal levels, and the number of normal mitochondria increased (P<0.05). In implanted hearts of DCM patients, however, up-regulated ET-1 transcript levels persisted and the number of normal mitochondria decreased, whereas the number of degenerated mitochondria increased (P<0.05), and edematous mitochondria remained unchanged in number. These results show that cardiac transplantation corrects the impaired hemodynamic and echocardiographic parameters in both groups, whereas in DCM, the molecular pathology of ET-1 system and mitochondria persists. Therefore, it is more likely that these changes are the cause rather than a consequence of DCM.

Perioperative acute right heart failure after orthotopic heart transplantation contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality. Vasodilators administered intravenously may decrease pulmonary vascular resistance, but also affect systemic circulation. A decrease of mean arterial pressure will result in reduced right coronary blood flow and deterioration of right ventricular performance. Vasodilators administered by inhalation, i.e. nitric oxide and prostacyclin, are attractive due to a more selective effect on the pulmonary circulation. This is the first report on the use of aerosolized iloprost, a long-acting prostacyclin analogue, applied for treatment of postoperative right heart failure in cardiac transplantation. After uneventful surgery, a heart transplant recipient was extubated on the first postoperative day and exhibited right heart failure on the following day. Standard treatment did not resolve this clinical problem sufficiently. A trial with inhalation of iloprost (16 microg per inhalation cycle, applied six times per day) was initiated. Iloprost inhalation resulted in a sufficient decrease of pulmonary vascular resistance (-23.5%), while cardiac index (+24.0%) and mixed venous saturation (+9.0%) increased. No profound effect on the systemic vascular resistance was observed (-2.8%). Iloprost inhalation may be an effective alternative to nitric oxide in the intensive care management of acute right heart failure after orthotopic heart transplantation. Due to the prolonged effect on the pulmonary vascular resistance, iloprost is especially useful for extubated patients.

Due to myocyte damage and an associated inflammatory response, it is possible that cardiac troponin T and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations may correlate with the histologic grade of rejection in endomyocardial biopsy samples obtained from patients who have received a heart transplant. In this study, 704 blood samples were obtained from 145 different heart transplant recipients just prior to endomyocardial biopsy. Plasma specimens were assayed for troponin T and CRP concentration and the results compared with the assigned International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) histologic grade. Rejection was defined as an ISHLT grade of 3A or higher. The negative predictive values were near 80% in all cases, and a statistically significant increase in median troponin T concentration was observed across ISHLT grades. After the first month posttransplantation, the specificity of the troponin T test (cutoff 0.1 ng/ml) was 95% and increased to 98% when false positives seen in renal disease patients were excluded. Both tests demonstrated poor sensitivity and positive predictive value for rejection. Neither CRP nor troponin T had sufficient sensitivity to serve as an alternative to endomyocardial biopsy in the diagnosis of acute cardiac allograft rejection. However, the troponin T test had a high specificity, especially when patients with renal insufficiency were excluded, and could serve as an adjunct test in this setting. When combined with a normal serum creatinine, a troponin T > or =0.1 ng/ml prior to endomyocardial biopsy correlated with graft rejection in almost all cases, making biopsy unnecessary.

A total of 284 patients who received the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial xenograft in the mitral position between 1980 and 1984 and 84 patients who received the Carpentier-Edwards pericardial xenograft in the mitral position between 1984 and 1999 were included in the study. The freedom from reoperation rates for both graft types were determined. For morphologic study, the pathologic findings of 23 valves of 123 explanted Ionescu-Shiley pericardial xenografts with structural valve deterioration, nonstructural valve deterioration, or both were determined and compared with those of 20 explanted Carpentier-Edwards pericardial xenografts with structural valve deterioration, nonstructural valve deterioration, or both. Each pathologic finding was graded and assigned a score. Both types were matched for age at reoperation (50-75 years) and duration of valve function (8-11 years). Freedom from reoperation caused by structural valve deterioration, nonstructural valve deterioration, or both was significantly better for Carpentier-Edwards pericardial xenografts than for Ionescu-Shiley pericardial xenografts at 8 years after the operation (Carpentier-Edwards pericardial xenografts: 91.3% vs Ionescu-Shiley pericardial xenografts: 71.9%, P =.0061), but it was similar for both types at 12 years (Carpentier-Edwards pericardial xenografts: 43.6% vs Ionescu-Shiley pericardial xenografts: 43.6%, P =.2865). No severe leaflet tears were seen among Carpentier-Edwards pericardial xenografts.

Increased sympathetic activity and plasma levels of norepinephrine, parasympathetic withdrawal and impaired baroreflex gain have been reported in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Since excessive neurohormonal activation is implicated in the progression of heart failure, it is crucial to measure and quantify it in clinical practice. Some techniques that may be suitable for this purpose such as catecholamine plasma level assessment or direct recording of the neural efferent activity to the peripheral muscles, require expertise and are very unattractive in terms of cost-effectiveness. On the contrary, the measures that test the reflex or tonic responses of the sinus node activity have been extensively used in both experimental and clinical studies. However, consensus regarding their true relevance in the clinical scenario has not yet been reached. Heart rate variability is one of the easiest techniques available for physicians but the identification of the RR intervals in CHF is often very difficult owing to the presence of rhythm disorders or of sino-atrial or atrioventricular blocks and the analytical softwares included in the commercially available Holter systems are not reliable enough. Similarly, for all methods currently employed in clinical practice, the assessment of baroreflex sensitivity in CHF has some limitations or is not applicable for all patients. In this article, the main clinical methods used to assess the autonomic nervous system in CHF are reviewed focusing on the clinical applicability of the obtained parameters. It is underlined that, using these techniques, many investigators have obtained important results in the pathophysiological comprehension of the disease, but to date their use in the clinical setting is very modest. Indeed, before the measurement of the autonomic nervous system can be applied to clinical practice and used to guide therapy, more precise insights into the link between the autonomic indexes and sympathetic or parasympathetic activity and between them and mortality are needed. Moreover, no standardization has been established for the various commercial systems and the development of their software has not been guided by any research committee. For many other techniques there are no commercially available devices and the software has been developed in the physiological laboratories as prototypes. These limitations will be overcome if the researchers succeed in convincing the companies about the importance and the clinical applicability of the evaluation of the autonomic nervous system. With regard to cardiac transplantation, as the donor heart is completely denervated, it constitutes an important physiological model for the study of autonomic activity. The more interesting research field has been the assessment of a possible post-transplant reinnervation both at the experimental and clinical levels. It has been shown that in animal models reinnervation occurs within the first year of heart transplantation. Several authors have demonstrated a time-dependent restoration of myocardial norepinephrine content as well as an increase in the heart rate and myocardial contractility in response to neural sympathetic stimulation. Parasympathetic efferent reinnervation has also been demonstrated in a canine transplanted model within 12 months of surgery. Despite evidence in favor of both sympathetic and parasympathetic reinnervation in animals, the problem of whether such reinnervation also occurs in humans is still debated, especially as far as parasympathetic reinnervation is concerned. The presence, in humans, of sympathetic reinnervation has been documented by different methods. However, there are significant differences regarding the degree of regeneration and the frequency of occurrence. It has also been assumed that the regeneration of sympathetic fibers takes place slowly over time. In contrast, regrowth of parasympathetic nerve fibers in patients after heart transplantation has not been unequivocally confirmed. Although various investigators have used the same method, their results differ and are indeed often contradictory. Recently it has been suggested that the type of surgery may have a major influence on neural and particularly parasympathetic regeneration. If the patients undergo heart transplantation by bicaval techniques the nerves are resected and they are more prone to regenerate towards the donor heart. This is not true if the traditional technique is employed. ", "label": 0}{"text": "The evolving management of acute right-sided heart failure in cardiac transplant recipients. Avoidance of the clinical syndrome of acute right-sided heart failure after heart transplantation is, unfortunately, not possible. Clinical experience and the literature certainly suggest that a significant factor in the successful management of right ventricular (RV) failure is recipient selection. Moreover, threshold hemodynamic values beyond which RV failure is certain to occur and heart transplantation is contraindicated do not exist. Nor are there values below which RV failure is always avoidable. Acute RV failure will remain a difficult and ever-present clinical syndrome in the transplant recipient. Goals in the treatment of this clinical problem include: 1. Preserving coronary perfusion through maintenance of systemic blood pressure. 2. Optimizing RV preload. 3. Reducing RV afterload by decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). 4. Limiting pulmonary vasoconstriction through ventilation with high inspired oxygen concentrations (100% FiO(2)), increased tidal volume and optimal positive end expiratory pressure ventilation. Inhaled nitric oxide is recommended before leaving the operating room in cases where the initial therapies have had little impact. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation is employed in patients with impaired left ventricular (LV) function and may be of benefit in patients with RV dysfunction resulting from ischemia, preservation injury or reperfusion injury. Optimal LV function reduces RV afterload and PVR. A proactive decision regarding RV assist device implantation is made before leaving the operating room and is highly dependent upon overall hemodynamics, size and function of the ventricles as seen on transesophageal echocardiography, renal function and surgical bleeding.

We sought to identify the optimal treatment strategy for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). Surgical treatment of HLHS involves either transplantation (Tx) or staged palliation of the native heart. Identifying the best treatment for HLHS requires integrating individual patient risk factors and center-specific data. Decision analysis is a modeling technique used to compare six strategies: staged surgery; Tx; stage 1 surgery as an interim to Tx; and listing for transplant for one, two, or three months before performing staged surgery if a donor is unavailable. Probabilities were derived from current literature and a dataset of 231 patients with HLHS born between 1989 and 1994. The goal was to maximize first-year survival. If a donor is available within one month, Tx is the optimal choice, given baseline probabilities; if no donor is found by the end of one month, stage 1 surgery should be performed. When survival and organ donation probabilities were varied, staged surgery was the optimal choice for centers with organ donation rates < 10% in three months and with stage 1 mortality <20%. Waiting one month on the transplant list optimized survival when the three-month organ donation rate was > or =30%. Performing stage 1 surgery before listing, or performing stage 1 surgery after an unsuccessful two- or three-month wait for transplant, were almost never optimal choices. The best strategy for centers that treat patients with HLHS should be guided by local organ availability, stage 1 surgical mortality and patient risk factors.

Lung transplantation therefore ultimately is the only alternative for patients whose PPH is severe and cannot be managed medically.

RR, RR variability, and MSNA were recorded 5+/-2 months (n=7, short-term HTRs) and 138+/-8 months (n=7, long-term HTRs) after heart transplantation and compared with matched hypertensive patients (n=7). A coherence function determined the coupling between LF oscillations in MSNA and RR. RR variance did not differ between short-term and long-term HTRs. However, LF variability was only 1+/-0.5 ms(2) in the short-term HTRs but was 15+/-8 ms(2) in the long-term HTRs (P<0.05). Normalized LF variability was also higher in the long-term HTRs (40+/-14 normalized unites) versus the short-term HTRs (6+/-3 normalized united, P<0.05) but did not differ from the LF variability of the hypertensive patients. Long-term HTRs were taking less cyclosporine (P<0.01) but had higher MSNA than the short-term HTRs (62+/-7 versus 31+/-7 burst/min, respectively, P<0.05). Coherence between LF oscillations in MSNA and RR was similar in the long-term HTRs (0.59+/-0.11) and the hypertensive patients (0.60+/-0.07) and was 3-fold greater than in the short-term HTRs (0.20+/-0.06, P<0.05). Cardiac reinnervation after long-term heart transplantation is characterized by a restoration of the coherence between LF oscillations in RR and MSNA. Higher MSNA in long-term than in short-term HTRs suggests that time elapsed after cardiac transplantation may be a major determinant of sympathetic excitation in heart transplant recipients.

Heart allograft tolerance in adult recipients can be induced in the LEW.1W to LEW.1A congeneic strain combination by pre-graft donor-specific blood transfusion (DST). Long-term survivors accept LEW.1W graft but reject third party skin grafts. As tolerant recipients of heart allografts showed an increase in anti-donor class II antibodies, we hypothesize that these antibodies could be instrumental in tolerance induction. However, anti-donor MHC class II alone prolonged graft survival but did not induce heart allograft tolerance in this combination. We analyzed the immune response patterns in heart allograft recipients following the injection of anti-donor class II antibodies (prolongation) or DST priming (tolerance). As suggested by the different phenomena, several immunological patterns were strikingly different between the two models. In strong contrast to DST-tolerant recipients, at 5 days after transplantation, neither Th1/Th2 nor inflammatory cytokines were inhibited in recipients treated with anti-donor class II antibodies, in which only prolongation of graft survival was induced. Nevertheless, in both models, depletion of resident dendritic cells (DC) from donor hearts inhibited tolerance induction (DST) or shortened allograft survival (anti-donor class II antibodies). Moreover, TGF-beta1 was not down-regulated and administration of neutralizing anti-TGF-beta1 antibody, which inhibited tolerance induction (DST), also shortened allograft survival (anti-donor class II antibodies). These results suggest that, in these two MHC class II-restricted models, both TGF-beta1 and donor DC have a pivotal role in prolonging graft survival. However, in the days following transplantation, further inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production, particularly Th1 and macrophage-derived cytokines is required for tolerance induction.

MMF treatment was used for induction in 18 patients, induction and rejection in 23 patients and graft vasculopathy in 3 patients. Dosing by body surface area (mg/m(2)), age and interval from transplantation were all independently associated with MPA level. There was a trend toward requiring higher doses to achieve desired levels (>3 ng/ml) in younger patients. The average dose to achieve desired levels was higher in the immediate post-transplant period. There was a trend that MPA levels for a given dose were higher in patients on concurrent tacrolimus therapy. (1) There is marked individual variation in pharmacokinetics of MMF in pediatric patients; (2) dosing by body surface area may be advantageous; (3) higher MMF doses may be required at younger ages and in the early period after transplantation; (4) lower MMF doses may be required with concurrent tacrolimus therapy; and (5) serum trough MPA levels may relate to efficacy. Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring of serum trough MPA levels may be required for individualized MMF dosing in pediatric cases.

In recent years a syndrome characterized by hypotension, acidosis, and vasodilatation, which we have designated HAV syndrome, has been reported to occur more frequently after heart transplantation (HT), but its pathogenesis is unknown. We analyzed consecutive patients undergoing HT between January 1994 and June 1998 (aged 50 +/- 8 years; 87% male; 40% African American; ischemia time, 190 +/- 20 minutes; given triple immunosuppression without anti-lymphocyte antibodies) in 2 groups: 38 (54%) who developed HAV (systemic vascular resistance < or = 800 dines x sec x cm(-5) and serum bicarbonate < or = 20 mEq/liter) and 32 (46%) who did not. To identify causes of HAV, we compared 113 pre-HT donor and recipient variables, 28 peri-HT variables, and 46 post-HT variables between groups. We used Mann-Whitney, Fisher exact, and chi-squared tests to compare variables and to determine significance. Univariate analysis showed that HAV patients had significantly greater recipient and donor weight (p = 0.000007 and 0.0017, respectively), longer ischemia times (p = 0.0052), pre-HT use of beta-blockers (p = 0.009), and longer waiting times for HT (p = 0.018). African-American patients had less HAV than Caucasians (p = 0.047). Patients with pre-HT mechanical circulatory assistance had less HAV than pharmacologically treated patients (p = 0.014). Multivariate analysis showed that recipient (p = 0.0004) and donor weight (p = 0.0394) and ischemia time (p = 0.0015) independently predicted HAV and correlated with HAV severity. Deaths at < or =30 days of HT occurred more in patients with (33%) than in those without (15%) HAV. (1) Hypotension, acidosis, and vasodilatation after HT are associated with high mortality. (2) Recipient and donor weights and ischemia time are independent risk factors for HAV. (3) Pre-HT mechanical circulatory assistance and African-American race confer protection against HAV. (4) Because HAV risk factors can be altered, prevention may be possible. Further study is needed to identify the cellular and humoral mediators of HAV.

In this study we compare the incidence of cardiac rejection and long-term survival after combined heart and kidney transplantation (HK) and single heart transplantation (H). Combined HK transplantation is a surgical option for patients with irreversible cardiac and renal failure. However, long-term results of combined HK transplantation on immunologic events and patient survival remain unknown. Between 1988 and 1997, 12 consecutive patients underwent combined HK transplantation (HK group) at a single institution. A control group (H group) of 24 single heart transplant recipients operated on within the same period was matched for age, pre-operative pulmonary vascular resistance, hepatic insufficiency and gender mismatch. Recipients and donors were ABO compatible without HLA antigen matching. All patients received immediate triple immunosuppression that included cyclosporine. Because of early renal dysfunction, cyclosporine was switched to anti-thymocyte globulin in 5 patients from the HK group and in 1 patient from the H group (p = 0.01). Actuarial freedom from heart rejection at 6 months and at 1 year following transplantation averaged 90 +/- 9% and 70 +/- 14% in the HK group, and 65 +/- 10% and 49 +/- 11% in the H group, respectively (p = 0.023). Actuarial survival at 1, 5 and 12 years was not significantly different between groups, at 66%, 55% and 28% in the HK group, and 66%, 44% and 32% in the H group, respectively (p = 0.66). The incidence of cardiac rejection was significantly lower. Long-term survival in the HK group was similar to that in the H group. Putative mechanisms of decreased cardiac rejection in the HK group include allogeneic stimulation, donor-derived dendritic cells and induction by anti-thymocyte globulins. The need for long-term immunosuppression may be reduced after combined heart and kidney transplantation.

Accelerated coronary artery disease (ACAD), a serious consequence after heart transplantation, is characterized by diffuse, concentric myointimal proliferation in the arteries. Increasing evidence supports the existence of a local renin-angiotensin system and the role of angiotensin-II in smooth muscle cell proliferation. We investigated the effect of angiotensin-II blocker candesartan and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril on experimental ACAD in a rat model. After heterotopic cardiac transplantation (Fisher to Lewis), recipients received 20 mg/kg/day candesartan or 40 mg/kg/day enalapril per os. Two groups of animals received additional pre-treatment with candesartan or enalapril 7 days before transplantation, and treatment was continued after grafting. All study groups including the controls received 3 mg/kg/day of sub-cutaneous cyclosporine for immunosuppression. A syngeneic group (Lewis to Lewis), serving as extra control, did not receive any treatment. Eighty days after grafting, we assessed the extent of ACAD in large and small arteries, using digitizing morphometry and expressed as mean vascular occlusion (MVO). In enalapril and candesartan pre- and post-treated animals, we observed significant reduction of MVO of intramyocardial arteries compared with the cyclosporine group (p < 0.005), to levels similar to the syngeneic transplants. MVO of epicardial arteries in enalapril and candesartan pre- or posttreated animals did not significantly differ from cyclosporine controls (p > 0.05). Our results support the hypothesis of 2 proliferative compartments in the development of ACAD, with differing receptor or enzyme distribution: the compartment of small, intramyocardial arteries in which ACAD can be reduced by ACE or AT(1) blockade, and that of large, epicardial arteries in which inhibition fails.

BACKGROUND; No significant improvement of overall graft survival in cardiac transplantation has occurred during the past decade, notwithstanding the identification of several prognostic donor and recipient risk factors. By translating multivariate results into iso-risk curves plots, stratified for medical urgency, we attempt to present results in a more practical manner, to be used as guidelines at the time of donor heart offer and of allocation. We analyzed all first heart-only transplants performed in adults and carried out between January 1, 1997, and June 30, 1998 (N = 1120). Before transplant, 687 patients were at home, 233 on hospital wards, and 200 on the intensive care unit. The overall Cox model yielded 5 independent factors associated with 1-year graft outcome: donor age, donor:recipient weight ratio, medical urgency, end-stage heart disease, and transplant country. We used the significant donor variables of donor age and donor:recipient weight ratio for the iso-risk curves; we calculated relative risks for all combinations of donor age and donor:recipient weight ratio. We obtained iso-risk curves by linking equal relative risks. All iso-risk curves showed that with older donor age, the donor:recipient weight ratio must be higher to obtain the same relative risk for all 3 medical urgency groups. The more urgent the heart transplant candidate, the higher the course of the iso-risk curve for all donor ages. Iso-risk curve is an elegant tool for presenting multivariate analyses in a more practical and patient-oriented manner. The more understandable prognostic factors become the more likely we are to achieve better results in cardiac transplantation and to use more optimally donor hearts. As an example, we have demonstrated the interaction between donor age, donor:recipient size ratio, and medical urgency.

The superior cardioprotective efficacy of this solution has been demonstrated previously when compared to University of Wisconsin solution following 4 hours of hypothermic ischemia. This study tested the hypothesis that pinacidil solution may extend preservation time and provide superior cardioprotective efficacy following 12 hours of ischemia. Sixteen rabbit hearts were assigned to receive either pinacidil solution or University of Wisconsin solution in a crystalloid-perfused Langendorff model. Thirty minutes of initial perfusion preceded baseline data acquisition. Left ventricle pressure-volume curves were generated by inflating an intra-ventricular latex balloon. Following cardioplegic administration, hearts underwent 12 hours of hypothermic storage. After 60 minutes of reperfusion, post-ischemic data were acquired. Pinacidil solution demonstrated significantly better myocardial preservation compared to University of Wisconsin solution, with better recovery of developed pressure (53.0 +/- 11.1% vs 20.7 +/- 4.3%, p = 0.017, respectively), post-ischemic coronary flow (55.3 +/- 12.6% vs 23.9 +/- 4.3%, p = 0.034), maximum systolic dP/dT (46.4 +/- 8.3% vs 20.2 +/- 5.1%, p = 0.018) and minimum diastolic -dP/dT (65.3 +/- 10.8% vs 20.2 +/- 5.1%, p = 0.002). Diastolic compliance, expressed as baseline/post-ischemic diastolic slope ratios, was also better preserved by pinacidil solution (0.55 +/- 0.09) vs University of Wisconsin solution (0.40 +/- 0.03) (p = 0.135). A novel pinacidil solution resulted in improved donor heart preservation during 12 hours of hypothermic ischemia compared to the \"gold standard,\" University of Wisconsin solution.

No data comparing the use and efficacy of chronic intravenous inotropic and vasodilator therapy in patients with advanced heart failure are available. we evaluated, in a group of patients with advanced heart failure undergoing chronic infusion with dobutamine or nitroprusside, in addition to optimized oral therapy, (1) the safety of chronic infusion, (2) the efficacy of both drugs in managing unloading therapy and (3) clinical outcome of the two therapeutic strategies. one hundred and thirteen patients receiving optimized oral therapy, in functional class III/IV with symptoms and signs of refractory heart failure and requiring additional pharmacological support with either intravenous dobutamine or nitroprusside were evaluated. Clinical and therapeutic management and clinical outcome of the two groups were considered. dobutamine was administered for 12 h/day for 20+/-23 days at a dosage of 7+/-3 microg/kg/min to 43 patients. The mean dose of nitroprusside was 0.76+/-0.99 microg/kg/min. The mean duration of use of this drug, administered as a 12-h/day infusion was 22+/-38 days. Nitroprusside infusion allowed greater doses of short-term ACE-inhibitors to be used compared to pre-infusion (ACE-inhibitor dose: 55+/-30 mg/day vs. 127+/-30 mg/day P<0.0001) and during dobutamine infusion (ACE-inhibitor dose: 85+/-47 mg/day vs. 127+/-30 mg/day P<0.002). Nitroprusside unlike dobutamine significantly improved the NYHA functional class. Of the 113 patients, 109 (97%) had a cardiac event during a mean follow-up of 337+/-264 days. Forty-four patients required hospitalization for worsening congestive heart failure, 45/113 (39%) patients died during the follow-up and 27/113 (24%) patients had a heart transplant in status one. Hospitalization, because of worsening heart failure was less frequent in the nitroprusside than in the dobutamine subgroup [29/51 (57%) vs. 19/22 (86%) P<0.02]. The overall mortality was 28% (20/70) in the nitroprusside group and 58% (25/43) in the dobutamine group (odds ratio 0.33 CI 0.16 to 0.73 P<0.006). In the group treated with nitroprusside, heart transplantation in status one was performed in 16/33 patients (48%), while in the dobutamine group this was done in 11/14 patients (78%) (odds ratio 0.25 CI 0.06-1.02 P<0.06).

A prospective ethnographic method was used to study 24 parents of 15 children prior to their decision of accepting or rejecting the transplant option for their children. Findings revealed that the style of parent decision making ranged from a desire to make an independent, autonomous choice to a wish for an authoritarian, paternalistic choice. Nurses and physicians can best support families in this situation, showing sensitivity to the steps that parents use to make their decisions. An ethical model of decision making is proposed that includes respect for differences in beliefs and values of all persons involved in the transplantation discussion.

The chemokine receptor, CCR5, and its three high-affinity ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein- (MIP) 1alpha, MIP-1beta, and regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), are expressed by infiltrating mononuclear cells during the rejection of clinical and experimental organ allografts, although the significance of these molecules in the pathogenesis of rejection has not been established. We studied intragraft events in four allograft models. First, we studied cardiac transplants in fully MHC-mismatched mice that were deficient in CCR5 or two of its ligands, MIP-1alpha or RANTES. Second we tested the effects of a neutralizing rat anti-mCCR5 monoclonal antibody on allograft survival. Third we assessed whether a subtherapeutic course of cyclosporine would potentiate enhance survival in CCR5-deficient recipients. Finally, we tested the effect of targeting CCR5 in a class II-mismatched model. Whereas mice deficient in expression of MIP-1alpha or RANTES reject fully MHC-mismatched cardiac allografts normally, CCR5-/- mice, or CCR5+/+ mice treated with a neutralizing mAb to mCCR5, show enhanced allograft survival. MHC class II-disparate mismatched are permanently accepted in CCR5-/- but not CCR5+/+ recipients. Finally, the beneficial effects of targeting of CCR5 are markedly synergistic with the effects of cyclosporine, resulting in permanent engraftment without development of chronic rejection. We conclude that CCR5 plays a key role in the mechanisms of host T cell and macrophage recruitment and allograft rejection, such that targeting of CCR5 clinically may be of therapeutic significance.

BALB/c skin allografts were transplanted onto C57BL/6 Rag 1-/- recipients reconstituted with CD4 cells from CD28-/- or CD40L-/- donors. The popliteal lymph node assay was used to study the role of these pathways on CD4-cell activation and priming in vivo. To investigate the role of CD40 and CD28 blockade on CD4-cell proliferation, the fluorescein dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester was used. We performed heterotopic cardiac transplantation using CD40-/- mice to evaluate the role of CD40 on donor versus recipient cells in CD4-mediated rejection. B6 Rag 1-/- recipients reconstituted with CD28-/- CD4+ T cells acutely rejected allografts (median survival time 15 days), whereas recipients reconstituted with CD40L-/- CD4+ T cells had significantly prolonged survival of BALB/c skin grafts (MST 71 days). CD40L blockade was equivalent to or inferior to CD28 blockade in inhibition of in vivo CD4-cell activation, priming for cytokine production, and proliferation responses to alloantigen. BALB/c recipients depleted of CD8 cells promptly rejected donor B6 CD40-/- cardiac allografts, whereas B6 CD40-/- recipients depleted of CD8 cells had significantly prolonged survival of BALB/c wild-type cardiac allografts. The CD40/CD40L pathway, but not the CD28/B7 pathway, is critical for CD4-mediated rejection responses, however, the responsible mechanisms remain unclear.

All heart, lung, or heart-lung recipients of organs from donors with a history of malignancy were reviewed. Donor and recipient demographics, histologic findings, and recurrence were reviewed. Twenty-two patients received 17 hearts, 3 lungs, and 2 heart-lung transplants from donors with known CNS or other malignancies. No malignancy transmissions were noted with astrocytomas (n = 3) or glioblastomas (n = 1), except a medulloblastoma that recurred at 6 months. The transmission rate for CNS tumors was 17% (1 of 6), and 1- and 3-year survivals were 67% and 50%, respectively. The most common non-CNS donor cancer was renal cell carcinoma (n = 5). Two renal cell cancer transmissions occurred, both when vascular extension was present. The most aggressive tumor transmission was choriocarcinoma (n = 2) and melanoma (n = 2). Two of 3 choriocarcinomas metastasized with 67% mortality, and both melanomas were transmitted and resulted in death.

The IPITTR experience indicates that tumor transmission is high (10 of 22, 45%) in cardiothoracic transplant recipients. Similar to intra-abdominal organ recipients in the IPITTR, (1) renal cell carcinomas without capsular invasion appear safe with no transmission, (2) vascular invasion in renal cell carcinoma appears to result in early tumor transmission, and (3) melanoma and choriocarcinoma have high rates of transmission with early and almost universal death.

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome or a variant was the primary diagnosis in 118 infants (69%). The overall 5-year survival rate was 43%.

As waiting times for transplants have lengthened, long-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has become more common in patients who present with severe cardiogenic shock leading to multiorgan failure. With these patients, we used the biventricular assist device (BVAD, Berlin Heart). In this report, we will describe our 4 years of experience with 11 patients on a BVAD who were discharged home while awaiting transplantation. The 11 patients underwent BVAD implantation from 1997 to 2000. These were 2 women and 9 men. The mean support time was 382 days (range: 156 - 567). The indication for BVAD was cardiomyopathy--six dilated, one restrictive and four ischemic. These patients were monitored for infections, thromboembolic events, bleeding complications, and psychological effects during the time they spent at home. Our experience shows that all of the patients could leave hospital following sufficient training for dressings and anticoagulation after recovering completely from secondary organ dysfunction. The mean time period the patients spent at home was 48 days (range: 3 - 182) days. Seven patients (63 %) had to be readmitted to the hospital--due to transitory ischemic attacks in two cases, hemorrhoidal bleeding in one and wound infections in four cases. One patient died of a traumatic accident during sexual activity. The use of a BVAD is feasible for outpatient use as a bridge to transplantation. It ensures the survival of the patient, enables recovery from multiorgan failure and offers an acceptable quality of life.

Heart transplantation is an established therapy for cardiomyopathy but is limited by organ shortage and expense. As a result, alternative operations have been proposed including coronary bypass, mitral valve repair, and left ventricular reconstruction. Because it is unknown whether alternative operations are less expensive than replacing the diseased heart, we compared in-hospital costs and early outcome of these operations with elective heart transplantation. We compared clinical and financial data of 268 patients with ejection fraction less than 30% who underwent elective heart transplantation (n = 52, UNOS status 2 only), coronary bypass (n = 176), mitral repair (n = 15), or left ventricular reconstruction (n = 25). Data were evaluated for between-group differences, with p less than 0.05 as significant. Preoperative ejection fraction, although similar for heart transplantation (21.2% +/- 1.3%), coronary bypass (25.8% +/- 0.4%), mitral repair (22.9% +/- 1.5%), and left ventricular reconstruction (24.2% +/- 2.1%), was significantly different between the former two (p < 0.001). There was no difference in operative mortality: 5.8% (3 of 52), 3.4% (7 of 176), 6.7% (1 of 15), and 4.0% (1 of 25), respectively (p = 0.8). However, total hospital cost of heart transplantation was significantly greater than all others: $75,992 +/- $5,380, $25,008 +/- $1,446, $32,375 +/- $2,379, and $26,584 +/- $4,076, respectively (p < 0.001). Organ procurement expenses alone comprised 39.7% ($30,169) of total transplant cost. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis failed to show any survival difference between the various groups (p = 0.86) Compared with heart transplantation, alternative operations yield a comparable early outcome and long-term survival, and are markedly less expensive. The cost of transplantation, which is largely due to procurement expenses, is yet another reason to attempt alternative operations for cardiomyopathy whenever feasible.

Because Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most prominent bacterial pathogen of childhood, the objective of this study was to define the role of S. pneumoniae as a pathogen in the cardiac transplant population. Medical records of cardiac transplant patients from March, 1990, through November, 2000, were reviewed to identify invasive pneumococcal infections after transplantation. Demographic, clinical and microbiologic data were reviewed. Nine (11%) of 80 patients had 12 episodes of pneumococcal bacteremia for an incidence rate of 39 cases/1,000 patient years. Patients who were African-American, transplanted before 2 years of age and transplanted because of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy were at increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease (P < 0.05). Six patients were eligible for the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine before their first invasive infection, but only 1 had received it at the recommended age. Most isolates (82%) were penicillin-susceptible, and no single serotype predominated. There were 2 deaths in the study group, but each was unrelated to infection. Three patients (33%) had recurrent invasive disease with a second serotype an average of 12 months after the first infection. The incidence of pneumococcal bacteremia in cardiac transplant patients is higher than in the general pediatric population. Risks for infection were being African-American, being younger than 2 years at the time of transplant and being transplanted because of idiopathic cardiomyopathy. It is plausible that pneumococcal vaccine would decrease this risk. ", "label": 0}{"text": "[Perspective of heart transplantation in advanced congenital cardiopathy: report of a case].

Chronic cardiac transplantation denervation (i.e., global sympathetic denervation with myocardial catecholamine depletion, plus parasympathetic denervation) is known to inhibit myocardial oxidation of glucose. It is not known whether this is due to increased utilization of lactate, lipid or ketone bodies. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the extraction and contribution of blood-borne fatty acids (FA) to overall oxidative energy conversion is increased. In anaesthetised dogs (control n = 6, cardiac denervated n = 6), we investigated fatty acid (FA) utilization. The studies were made at least four weeks after surgical cardiac denervation. Measurements were made of total FAs and with a radio-labelled tracer (U-14C palmitate). The contribution of FA utilisation to overall substrate oxidation rose from 31% (control) to 48% (cardiac denervated). The increase in the ratio (%) of CO2 production from palmitate oxidation to total CO2 production increased from 4.0 +/- 1.8 (control) to 10.6 +/- 5.8 (denervated, p = 0.04). The time from uptake of FA to release of CO2 product was unaltered. We conclude that the contribution of FA oxidation to overall energy conversion is increased in chronically denervated hearts, which is postulated to result from a decline in the active form of pyruvate dehydrogenase. This would appear to be a result of chronic catecholamine depletion. ", "label": 0}{"text": "T cell subsets and in vitro immune regulation in \"infectious\" transplantation tolerance. CD4-targeted mAb therapy results in permanent acceptance of cardiac allografts in rat recipients, in conjunction with features of the infectious tolerance pathway. Although CD4(+) T cells play a central role, the actual cellular and molecular tolerogenic mechanisms remain elusive. This study was designed to analyze in vitro alloimmune responses of T lymphocytes from CD4 mAb-treated engrafted hosts. Spleen, but not lymph node, cells lost proliferative response against donor alloantigen in MLR and suppressed test allograft rejection in adoptive transfer studies, suggesting compartmentalization of tolerogenic T cells in transplant recipients. A high dose of exogenous IL-2 restored the allogeneic response of tolerogenic T cells, indicating anergy as a putative mechanism. Vigorous proliferation of the tolerogenic T cells in in vivo MLR supports the existence of alloreactive lymphocytes in tolerogenic T cell repertoire and implies an active operational suppression mechanism. The tolerogenic splenocytes suppressed proliferation of naive splenocytes in vitro, consistent with their in vivo property of dominant immune regulation. Finally, CD45RC(+) but not CD45RC(-) T cells from tolerant hosts were hyporesponsive to alloantigen and suppressed the proliferation of normal T cells in the coculture assay. Thus, nondeletional, anergy-like regulatory mechanisms may operate via CD4(+)CD45RC(+) T cells in the infectious tolerance pathway in transplant recipients.

Transplants of tissues depleted of passenger leukocytes are upon in vitro culture usually accepted in allogeneic recipients. Accordingly, fully allogeneic embryonic thymic epithelium was suggested to be poorly immunogenic. However, this tissue is capable of inducing donor-specific tolerance to peripheral tissues, when restoring T cell development in nude mice, through the production of regulatory cells. In the present work, adult immunocompetent allogeneic recipients were grafted with embryonic tissues isolated at stages before hemopoietic colonization or even before the establishment of circulation. Allogeneic thymic epithelium of day 10 embryos and heart primordium of day 8 embryonic donors were always rejected. Acute rejection of the thymic anlagen takes place in less than 12 days, with maximal CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell infiltrates at 10 days post-transplant. In addition, a significant infiltrate of NK1.1(+) cells is observed, although without any essential role in this process. Furthermore, recipients lacking the indirect pathway of Ag presentation to CD4(+) T cells do not reveal any significant delay in rejection, even when CD8(+) T cells are also eliminated. Thus, our experimental approach reveals acute allograft rejection in the absence of all known pathways of naive T cell activation and therefore unveils a novel graft rejection mechanism that should be mediated by direct recognition of parenchymal cells. Given the importance of dendritic cells in naive T cell activation, it is likely that cross-reactive memory T cells may also drive rejection.

Recent studies using mouse models demonstrate that CD4(+) T cells are sufficient to mediate acute cardiac allograft rejection in the absence of CD8(+) T cells and B cells. However, the mechanistic basis of CD4-mediated rejection is unclear. One potential mechanism of CD4-mediated rejection is via elaboration of proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-gamma. To determine whether IFN-gamma is a critical cytokine in CD4-mediated acute cardiac allograft rejection, we studied whether the expression of IFN-gamma receptors on the donor heart was required for CD4-mediated rejection. To investigate this possibility, purified CD4(+) T cells were transferred into immune-deficient mice bearing heterotopic cardiac allografts from IFN-gamma receptor-deficient (GRKO) donors. While CD4(+) T cells triggered acute rejection of wild-type heart allografts, they failed to trigger rejection of GRKO heart allografts. The impairment in CD4-mediated rejection of GRKO hearts appeared to primarily involve the efferent phase of the immune response. This conclusion was based on the findings that GRKO stimulator cells provoked normal CD4 proliferation in vitro and that intentional in vivo challenge of CD4 cells with wild-type donor APC or the adoptive transfer of in vitro primed CD4 T cells failed to provoke acute rejection of GRKO allografts. In contrast, unseparated lymph node cells acutely rejected both GRKO and wild-type hearts with similar time courses, illustrating the existence of both IFN-gamma-dependent and IFN-gamma-independent mechanisms of acute allograft rejection.

The development of accelerated graft arteriosclerosis is a major cause of late death after orthotopic heart transplantation. The influence and the extent of peritransplant injury, especially of cardiomyocyte or capillary endothelial cell edema is discussed. A morphometric ultrastructural analysis of myocardial biopsies from 29 donor hearts (21 male, age 34+/-11 years) was performed. Right ventricular biopsies were obtained before cardioplegia (A), immediately following cardioplegia (B) (Custodiol, Dr. F. K\u00f6hler Chemie GmbH, Alsbach-H\u00e4hnlein, Germany), before implantation (C), after 30 (D) or 60 (E) min of reperfusion and 1 week after transplantation (F). Mean ischemic time was 185+/-68 min. Quantitative electron microscopy was carried out in five samples per heart and time point and in 30 test fields per sample by 'random systematic sampling' and 'point and intersection counting'. As parameters for cell edema the volume density of myofibrils in cardiomyocytes and the mean barrier thickness of capillary endothelia were analyzed. P-values of less than 0.05 were regarded as significant. Significant differences in contrast to the previous values are marked by *. The volume density of myofibrils (vol.%) was as follows: (B) 63.6+/-3.2, (C) 61.8+/-3.2, (D) 62.9+/-3.2, (E) 63.6+/-4.5.

Apart from a generally accepted edema of cardiomyocytes a relevant capillary endothelial cell edema develops during clinical heart transplantation. In contrast to cardiomyocytes the cell edema of endothelia shows a more pronounced and significant progression during cold ischemia and early reperfusion. After 60 min of reperfusion it is still significantly more pronounced than at the onset of ischemia. After 1 week there are no statistical differences compared to the initial values. Thus, an edema of capillary endothelia probably will trigger inhomogeneities in capillary perfusion. Peritransplant injury of endothelia may contribute to the later development of accelerated allograft arteriosclerosis.

Experimental and control animals then acted as recipients of fully mismatched WF vascularized cardiac allografts. Recipients received immunosuppression in the form of cyclosporine at a tapering dose that allows for long-term allograft survival. Animals were sacrificed at either 3 or 6 mo, with allograft arterial luminal occlusion scored on elastin stains by a blinded observer. At 3 mo, mean vessel scores were significantly higher in the RT1(u).A-immunized versus class II-immunized and control groups (P < 0.05). By 6 mo, there was progression of chronic allograft vasculopathy and a significantly higher mean vessel score in the RT1(u).A- and RT1(u).D-immunized versus RT1(u).B and control groups (P < 0.05).

Concomitant with functional changes were marked increases in apoptotic cells at 2 (2.69%) and 6 (5.98%) hours of reperfusion with a concomitant decrease in lamin B1 (2% and 7.6%, respectively) with no evidence of necrotic cells.

Donor hearts were subjected to 18 and 24 hours of PRES (2 degrees C to 4 degrees C) with and without cyclosporine A (CyS) treatment (apoptosis blocker). CyS was given to the donor animal (10 mg/kg), in the PRES solution (10(-5) mol/L), slowly infused during the PRES period (1 mL/min), and also to the recipient animal (2.5 mg/kg). After 18 hours of PRES with CyS, function returned to 100% within 1 hour and stayed at this level throughout a 6-hour recovery period. Apoptotic myocytes were reduced (55%) after 18 hours PRES with CyS treatment, and 6-hour reperfusion lamin B1 was reduced to only 3.7%. Twenty-four hour PRES in UW resulted in no functional recovery. However, after CyS treatment, functional recovery returned to 100% after 4 hours of reperfusion. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine phosphate (CP) concentrations were surprisingly the same with or without CyS treatment at 18 hours and lower with 24 hours. Use of CyS in the PRES solution prolongs myocardial viability during donor heart PRES.

Split-liver transplantation is becoming a useful technique to expand the donor pool. Whether the split should be performed in situ or ex situ is not clear. One potential disadvantage of in situ splits is that prolonged surgical time and increased blood loss may negatively affect the function of other solid organs (kidneys, pancreas, and heart) procured from the same donor. Therefore, we studied the function of other organs posttransplantation. Between September 1, 1999, and March 31, 2000, we performed six in situ splits at the University of Minnesota (Minneapolis, MN). These six splits yielded six right-lobe liver grafts and six left-lobe liver grafts, which were transplanted into 12 adult-size recipients. Other grafts obtained from these six donors were as follows: kidney (n = 11), heart (n = 4), lungs (n = 1), pancreas (n = 2), and kidney-pancreas (n = 1). We then analyzed posttransplantation function of these grafts and the postoperative course of transplant recipients. All six donors were hemodynamically stable at the time of procurement. Mean donor age was 19.7 years. Mean surgical time for the procurement was 7.4 hours, with an average blood loss of 490 mL during in situ splitting of the liver. The 12 liver grafts showed good initial function with no primary nonfunction. The other organs also showed good function. Of 11 kidney recipients, only 1 patient developed delayed graft function, which resolved within 4 days. In addition, 1 kidney was lost early because of severe acute rejection. For the 10 recipients with functioning kidneys, mean creatinine level at hospital discharge was 2.0 mg/dL, and mean creatinine level after an average 9-month follow-up was 1.3 mg/dL. Of the 4 heart transplant recipients, 3 patients had good graft function immediately posttransplantation, with an ejection fraction greater than 60%, minimal inotropic requirements, and no surgical complications. The fourth heart transplant recipient, a critically ill status 1 patient, had poor initial function and a prolonged intensive care unit stay.

In cardiac transplant recipients, long-term survival may be limited by transplant coronary artery disease (TxCAD). Hyperhomocysteinemia (Hhcy) has been associated with vascular disease and is common in transplant recipients. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between fasting homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations and TxCAD in a cohort of cardiac transplant recipients. Forty-eight patients more than 5 yr after transplant were recruited from a cohort of 72 consecutive patients with in-depth analysis of homocysteine levels from the Cardiac Transplant Clinic. Early morning fasting blood was obtained, and the plasma separated and frozen within 30 min. Hcy concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with pulsed integrated amperometry. Coronary angiograms were reviewed in a blinded fashion. TxCAD was diagnosed, using the most recent angiogram, when a >25% lesion was present anywhere in the coronary tree. Forty-eight patients transplanted between 1985 and 1994 were studied. The mean Hcy concentration for the cohort was 23.5+/-5.0 micromol/L, all patients had homocysteine levels above the upper range of normal (5-15 micromol/L). Hcy concentrations were significantly higher in patients with angiographic evidence of TxCAD: 25.0+/-5.9 vs. 21.9+/-3.4 micromol/L, p=0.03. This effect persisted when covariates were taken into account using logistic regression analysis. Hhcy is associated with TxCAD. Prospective studies are required to confirm this association and to assess the efficacy of Hcy-lowering therapy in this patient population.

To determine whether conversion from cyclosporin A (CsA) to tacrolimus (TAC)-based immunosuppressive therapy is safe and might lead to improvement in the clinical side effect profile we studied 55 cardiac allograft recipients. Ten stable patients were electively converted (0.2-1.5 yr after transplantation; group I) and 45 patients were converted on indication (0.5-14 yr after transplantation; group II). We studied blood pressure, cholesterol level and renal function in all patients. To unravel the mechanisms by which CsA may exert its toxic effects and to evaluate whether conversion is associated with immune activation, we analyzed the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 system and intragraft interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-15 mRNA expression by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative flow cytometry in the selectively converted patients (group I). Conversion did not result in immune activation as no clinical, histological or molecular signs of immune activation (increased intragraft IL-2 and IL-15 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression) leading to rejection were found. It did not improve renal function neither in patient group I nor in patient group II. However, after conversion the blood pressure decreased (group I: systolic 154+/-16 vs 143+/-21 mmHg, p=0.03, diastolic: 99+/-11 vs 90+/-11, p=0.02 and group II: systolic 155+/-17 vs 142+/-14, p<0.001, diastolic: 99+/-11 vs 91+/-8 mmHg, p<0.001).

We compare the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blocker on density of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) in a heterotopic heart transplantation model. Hearts of F344 rats were heterotopically transplanted into Lewis rat recipients immunosuppressed with cyclosporine (10 mg/kg/day). Recipients were treated orally with the AT(1) receptor blocker L-158809 (3 mg/kg/day, n = 6), enalapril (3 mg/kg/day, n = 6), or vehicle only (n = 6) for 90 days. Density of myocordial beta-ARs was determined with an autoradiographic technique using [(3)H]CGP-12177. Graft status, the sum of the functional score and the score for color, was preserved better in the L-158809-treated group (5.8 +/- 0.9) and in the enalapril-treated group (5.6 +/- 0.8) than in the vehicle-treated group (3.8 +/- 0.9, p < 0.05). The grades of graft coronary artery disease in the L-158809-treated group and in the enalapril-treated group were significantly less than that seen in the vehicle-treated group. The density of myocardial beta-AR (fmol/mg of protein) was 3.5 +/- 0.5 in the L-158809-treated group (p < 0.05 vs. vehicle-treated group) and 3.2 +/- 0.5 (p < 0.05) in the enalapril-treated group but was 2.2 +/- 0.4 in the vehicle-treated group. L-158809 is as effective as enalapril in restoring myocardial beta-AR density in immunosuppressed rat transplant model, and this efficacy, as well as the prevention of graft coronary arteriosclerosis, is probably associated with the preservation of graft status.

We have shown that treatment with molecularly engineered, allochimeric [alpha1 hl/u]-RT1.Aa class I MHC antigens bearing donor-type Wistar-Furth (WF, RT1.Au) amino acid substitutions for host-type ACI (RTI.Aa) sequences in the alpha1-helical region induces donor-specific tolerance to cardiac allografts in rat recipients. This study examined the effect of allochimeric molecules on the development of chronic rejection. Allochimeric [alpha1 hl/u]-RT1.Aa class I MHC antigenic extracts (1 mg) were administered via the portal vein into ACI recipients of WF hearts on the day of transplantation in conjunction with subtherapeutic oral cyclosporine (CsA, 10 mg/kg/day, days 0-2). Control groups included recipients of syngeneic grafts and ACI recipients of WF heart allografts treated with high-dose CsA (10 mg/kg/day, days 0-6). WF hearts in ACI rats receiving 7 days of CsA exhibited myocardial fibrosis, perivascular inflammation, and intimal hyperplasia at day 80. At day 120, these grafts displayed severe chronic rejection with global architectural disorganization, ventricular fibrosis, intimal hyperplasia, and progressive luminal narrowing. In contrast, WF hearts in rats treated with [alpha1 hl/u]-RT1.Aa molecules revealed only mild perivascular fibrosis, minimal intimal thickening, and preserved myocardial architecture. Alloantibody analysis demonstrated no IgM alloantibodies in all groups. An attenuated, but detectable, anti-WF IgG response was present in recipients receiving allochimeric molecules, with IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses predominating. Immunohistochemical analysis of allografts demonstrated minimal T cell infiltration and IgG binding to vascular endothelium. Treatment with allochimeric molecules prevents the development of chronic rejection. Such effect may be in part caused by deviation of host alloantibody responses.

The use of homograft tissue instead of various artificial materials in contemporary cardiovascular surgery, although limited by the constant shortage of donor organs, has become the clinically preferable procedure. The proper technique of heart retrieval, with strict donor qualification criteria and sterility procedures, is one of the key points in the successful preparation of allografts to be used later in a selected group of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, especially in the repair of pediatric congenital heart defects. The article presents the most popular surgical technique to use for retrieving a heart for cardiac homograft in multiorgan procurement and routine autopsy, including the immediate preliminary preparation and transport, as recommended by the majority of tissue bank institutions. The qualification criteria for tissue donation, delicate preparation techniques, and sterility protocols are also important issues for successful cardiac homograft retrieval.

The death rate due to rejection with this invasive method is 5-6 % in the first postoperative year. The aim of this retrospective data analysis from cardiac recipients was to prove the diagnostic reliability of a non-invasive electrophysiological method for rejection monitoring. We daily analyzed the QRS-complex amplitude of the intramyocardial electrogram, which we received over a period from one year via a pacemaker with a telemetric capability. The diagnostic guideline for a suspected rejection was the reduction of the QRS-complex amplitude by more than 8 %. Out of 734 patients 558 were included in the study. Biopsy was only performed when the non-invasive rejection monitoring data (QRS-complex amplitude plus echocardiography) showed a discrepancy for rejection. None of the patients died due to rejection, 273 at least once underwent a biopsy, and 285 never had a biopsy. The method reached a sensitivity of 0.9777, a specificity of 0.9634, a negative predictive value of 0.9850, and a positive predictive value of 0.9459. Daily electrophysiological non-invasive monitoring of rejection seems to be superior to endomyocardial biopsy. Death of patients due to rejection can be minimised.

Reduced skeletal muscle strength is characteristic of individuals following heart transplantation. Weight lifting exercise has been demonstrated as an effective means by which to increase muscular strength in other cardiac patients but the appropriateness of this form of exercise in heart transplant patients has not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to describe the cardiovascular responses of heart transplant patients to a single, prolonged bout of weight lifting training. Twenty-three heart transplant recipients were stratified into early (Early; 3 months; n=6), intermediate (Intermediate; 1-3 years; n=7) and late (Late; 5-14 years; n=10) post transplant groups and studied in four experimental conditions: supine rest, upright rest, single leg-press exercise (28 repetitions over 2 min 20 s at 50% 1 repetition maximum) and recovery. Swan-Ganz catheterization allowed measurement of right heart pressures and cardiac output by thermodilution. Systemic arterial pressures and heart rate were measured continuously using a non-invasive finger cuff. Cardiac output increased by 30, 40 and 54% during exercise in Early, Intermediate and Late, respectively. Heart rate increased by 4.5% in Early compared to 11 and 16% increases in Intermediate and Late. At peak exercise, systolic blood pressures reached average values of 179+/-9, 180+/-14 and 176+/-8 mmHg in Early, Intermediate and Late, respectively. Average mean pulmonary artery pressure did not exceed 30 mmHg and average pulmonary wedge pressure did not exceed 15 mmHg in any group during the exercise. These observations indicate that a lengthened set of single leg-press exercise at a moderate lifting intensity can be performed within safe and acceptable physiological limits in patients following heart transplantation.

Arterial blood pressure and cardiac output are often reduced in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Counterregulatory mechanisms with increased neurohormonal activation and changes in the distribution of cardiac output are assumed to secure vital organ perfusion. However, clinical examination of patients with CHF frequently reveals neurological symptoms with dizziness and memory problems, suggesting altered brain perfusion. In this study we determined whether cerebral blood flow (CBF) is reduced in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III and IV (n=12) compared with healthy control subjects (n=12). Furthermore, we examined whether heart transplantation (n=5) could restore CBF. CBF was estimated by single-photon emission computed tomography and (133)Xe as tracer, and middle cerebral artery velocity was measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasound. In the CHF patients, CBF was 36+/-1 mL/min per 100 g, corresponding to a 31% reduction compared with the control group (52+/-5 mL/min per 100 g) (P<0.05). After heart transplantation, CBF increased from 35+/-3 mL/min per 100 g before transplantation to 50+/-3 mL/min per 100 g within the first postoperative month (P<0.05). We conclude that CBF is substantially, but reversibly, reduced in patients with NYHA class III/IV heart failure.

Laboratory services for the support of heart and lung transplantation in Australia have adapted to the special needs of the clinicians looking after the heart and lung transplantation patients. Pre-transplantation standardized tests encompassing a wide variety of different parameters are carried out both to establish the suitability of patients for a transplant and to maximize the chance of success following this procedure. Potential solid organ recipients routinely have blood samples sent to a number of centers Australia-wide so that human leukocyte antigen (HLA) presensitization can be checked for at the time a donor becomes available in any state in Australia. Although prospective HLA matching is not performed for thoracic organ transplant recipients, pre-existing antibodies to donor HLA antigens are a contra-indication to transplantation. Following transplantation, the predominant roles of the laboratory are in the monitoring of immunosuppressive drug levels, in the detection of allograft rejection, and in the detection of bacterial infection or viral reactivation. While a number of markers have been proposed in the detection of rejection, we currently rely on interpretation of the histological analysis of biopsies. The treatment with immune suppressive agents, in particular cyclosporin A, has made organ transplantation from non-HLA identical donors possible. As cyclosporin A and other immune suppressive drugs have significant side effects, their concentrations need to be carefully followed to guarantee sufficient immune suppression while avoiding renal failure and other complications including excessive immunosuppression and infectious disease risk. Recently, the role of viral reactivation with the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has attained more prominence. HCMV is a potential pathogen in up to 90% of thoracic organ transplant recipients and in the pre-gancyclovir era, it was a major cause of morbidity and mortality in at-risk lung transplant recipients. New PCR-based assays that measure the viral load levels of HCMV allow earlier intervention and more appropriate treatment strategies to prevent the HCMV disease syndromes and optimize the HCMV prophylaxis strategy. Diagnostic pathology testing to support heart and lung transplantation is a combination of routine testing and specialized testing. Depending on the time-critical nature of the tests, this testing has to be done on site or in more centralized testing facilities.

We have confirmed that NOS2 increases cardiac allograft survival. We now show that there is less inflammation of cardiac allografts in wild-type hosts than in NOS2-null hosts. Furthermore, staining for von Willebrand factor reveals that the presence of NOS2 is correlated with the presence of Weibel-Palade bodies inside endothelial cells, whereas the absence of NOS2 is correlated with the release of Weibel-Palade bodies. Weibel-Palade bodies contain mediators that promote thrombosis and inflammation. Therefore, nitric oxide (NO) may stabilize the vessel wall and prevent endothelial activation in part by inhibiting the release of the contents of Weibel-Palade bodies. Prevention of Weibel-Palade body release might be a mechanism by which NO protects the vessel wall from inflammatory disorders such as atherosclerosis or graft arteriosclerosis.

These mice cannot mount an indirect response. Eliminating the indirect pathway actually made it more difficult to achieve prolonged allograft survival when we used costimulatory blockade than when both pathways were available. Costimulatory blockade was ineffective even when CD4(+) T cells from normal animals were transferred into recipients that lacked MHC class II molecules.

Therefore, in this study, we examined the ability of splenic mature dendritic cells to induce operational tolerance to fully allogeneic antigens using mouse heterotopic heart transplantation model. CBA (H2k) mice received i.v. injections with donor splenic dendritic cells or B cells in the absence or presence of monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for CD40 ligand or CD80/CD86 2 weeks before transplantation of a C57BL/10 (H2b) heart. When donor dendritic cells were injected i.v. 2 weeks before transplantation, rejection response was accelerated compared with that of naive mice [median survival time (MST) = 7 and 8 days, respectively]. However, when CD40 pathway was blocked by anti-CD40 ligand mAb, i.v. injection of donor dendritic cells but not B cells induced indefinite graft survival (MST >100 and 20 days, respectively). Mice treated with anti-CD40 ligand mAb alone rejected their grafts with a MST of 18 days. Intravenous injection of donor dendritic cells and B cells in combination with anti-CD80/CD86 mAbs was less effective to induce graft prolongation (MST = 9.5 and 13 days, respectively).

Chemokines play an essential role in regulating the infiltration of leukocytes into allografts in experimental models. Little is known of their expression or function after human cardiac transplantation. We analyzed 169 sequential human endomyocardial biopsies by immunocytochemistry for infiltration by CD3(+) T cells and the expression of the chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR3, CCR5, and CXCR3. In both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, the expression of each of the chemokine receptors correlated with the degree of CD3(+) T-cell infiltration. In particular, the expression of CXCR3 was temporally and spatially associated with CD3(+) T-cell infiltrates and correlated with the histopathological diagnosis of acute rejection (OR, 11.73 and 4.05, respectively; P<0.001). Of 7 patients followed up longitudinally for 1 year, 4 with consecutive biopsies developed intimal thickening by intravascular ultrasound. In these patients, there was a trend for persistent expression of CD3- and CXCR3-expressing infiltrates in the later part of the first posttransplant year. The chemokines eotaxin, IP-10, lymphotactin, MCP-1, Mig, RANTES, and SDF-1 were examined in an additional 35 biopsies by RT-PCR. Eotaxin, lymphotactin, MCP-1, Mig, and SDF-1 were present in both normal and rejecting biopsies. However, the CXCR3 ligand IP-10, which was rarely expressed in normal biopsies, was markedly induced in acute rejection (OR, 19.43; P=0.01).

Inbred lean Zucker rats (>26 generations) served as donors and recipients of the cardiac grafts. Donor hearts were explanted at 60 or 90 days. Explanted hearts were processed for coronary artery histological analysis. Cytokine expression was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the presence of T cells within the explanted hearts was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Forty-six transplantations were made, and TxCAD developed in all but one of the transplanted hearts. Overall, one third of the vessels examined were affected by TxCAD, and in roughly half of these vessels, the disease was severe. Native hearts were free of atherosclerosis. Interleukin-2 was absent from the transplanted hearts, and T cells were present in minimal amounts (<1 per low-power field).

Rationale for chronic parenteral inotropic support. The available evidence suggests that while chronic inotropic support likely exerts a long-term deleterious effect on survival, their use is accompanied by short-term enhancements in symptomatology and decreases in medical resource use, thereby curtailing the overall medical costs. The decision to use chronic parenteral inotropic support should not be made lightly and must be considered only after all evidence based therapeutic options has been investigated thoroughly and tried (Fig. 1). This should include not only hemodynamic monitoring-based drug therapy but [figure: see text] also appropriate consideration for options such as heart transplantation or patient enrollment into large-scale drug trials that seek to answer pertinent issues relating to various aspects of advanced heart failure therapeutics. The use of parenteral inotropic support as a chronic bridge to transplantation is accepted widely but remains controversial in other scenarios. For instance, when refractory congestion or hypoperfusion is exhibited in the absence of any definitive medical or mechanical option, it may be wise to contemplate inotropic support after appropriate informed consent has been obtained from the patient. Lastly, it is of great importance to continually seek ways to transit the patient from this approach to a definitive therapeutic end point, such as with transition to oral beta-blockade, which may be better tolerated in the patient with advanced heart failure using an inotropic umbrella.

However, the mechanisms of altered myocyte function caused by nitric oxide production in this setting are not established. We measured intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) transients (fluo-3, confocal microscopy), fractional shortening (video motion), and L-type Ca2+ currents (whole-cell patch clamp) 5 days after transplantation in ventricular myocytes freshly isolated from syngenic (Balb/C into Balb/C) and allogenic (Balb/C into C3H) transplants. L-type Ca2+ currents, [Ca2+]i transient amplitudes, and fractional shortening did not differ between nonrejecting, syngenic and rejecting, allogenic transplants. Catecholamine responsiveness as analyzed by the change in the peak [Ca2+]i transient induced by 100 nM isoproterenol was also similar. Superfusion with l-arginine, an NOS substrate, caused decreased shortening with no change in [Ca2+]i transients in allogenic myocytes, but had no effect in syngenic myocytes.

This study tests the hypothesis that a combination of ganciclovir plus CMV hyperimmune globulin (CMVIG) is more effective than ganciclovir alone for preventing acute CMV illness and its long-term sequelae. The study population receiving CMVIG (n=80) included 27 heart transplant recipients (D+/R-) and 53 heart-lung and lung transplant recipients (R+ and/or D+). Each group was matched with historical controls who underwent transplantation within the preceding 2-3 years. Outcome measures compared were as follows: 3-year incidence of CMV disease; fungal infection; acute rejection; survival; rates and severity of transplant coronary artery disease (in heart patients) defined by intimal thickness (ultrasound) and coronary artery stenosis (angiographic); and incidence and death from obliterative bronchiolitis defined by pathological criteria on endobronchial biopsy specimens (in heart-lung/lung patients). Patients treated with CMVIG had a higher disease-free incidence of CMV, lower rejection incidence, and higher survival rate compared with the patients treated with ganciclovir alone. The coronary artery intimal thickness and the prevalence of intimal thickening were lower in the patients receiving CMVIG. Heart-lung and lung transplant patients treated with CMVIG had lower incidences of obliterative bronchiolitis and death from obliterative bronchiolitis and longer survival compared with the patients treated with ganciclovir alone.

The mechanisms of cardiac allograft vasculopathy and its predisposing factors are multifactorial and as yet not well established. To determine the influence of endothelial dysfunction on the development of intimal thickening, we prospectively analyzed the vasomotor response to acetylcholine and nitroglycerin, as well as other donor and recipient variables. Findings were correlated with the coronary intimal thickness, which was evaluated by means of intravascular ultrasonography. Nineteen patients who had undergone heart transplantation 4.89 +/- 2.35 years previously and who had angiographically normal coronary arteries were included. Endothelial function was analyzed by quantitative coronary analysis of the vasomotor response of the left anterior descending artery to acetylcholine. An intimal thickness index, reflecting the percentage of intima obstructing the coronary lumen, was calculated. Nine (47%) patients showed endothelial dysfunction, and the remaining 10 (53%) patients had a normal response. Four (44%) of 9 patients with a weight gain of greater than 20% after the operation showed endothelial dysfunction compared with none of the 10 patients with normal responses (P <.04). The severity of the intimal thickness correlated with the years after transplant (r = 0.45, P <.05). Patients with endothelial dysfunction had more intimal thickening than those without (32% +/- 17% vs 17% +/- 12%, respectively; P <.05). Furthermore, the degree of intimal thickening correlated with the magnitude of the vasomotor response to acetylcholine (r = -0.60, P =.006). No relationship was found between intimal thickness and the vasodilatory response to nitroglycerin. As independent variables for intimal thickness, multivariate analysis detected the magnitude of the response to acetylcholine (P =.0005), years after transplant (P =.01), and ischemic time (P =.03). Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is a multifactorial disease the severity of which increases over time. Endothelial dysfunction is a predictive factor of intimal thickening severity.

A 6-year-old female who had been admitted to the hospital after cerebrovascular embolization of a fragment of sarcoma of the mitral valve experienced sudden cardiovascular collapse due to occlusion of the left coronary artery. She was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and underwent coronary embolectomy and resection of the tumor from the mitral valve and its tendinous cords. Left ventricular function did not improve, and she underwent orthotopic heart transplantation.

This study reports the first direct, quantitative measurement using an electrochemical method of NO produced from rejecting allograft tissue studied in vitro. A rat heterotopic abdominal transplant preparation was utilized. Day 7 isograft (ACI to ACI) or allograft (Lewis to ACI) transplanted hearts were atraumatically harvested and suspended at 4 degrees C in Ringers-Hepes solution. An electrochemical system highly sensitive and specific for NO consisting of a Nafion-coated platinum disk electrode (lower limit, 50 nM NO) coupled to an analysis system measured ongoing oxidation of NO. Measurements were carried out after inserting the electrode in the tissue block and warming the block to 25 degrees C. Additional measurements were also made after incubation of tissue with aminoguanidine (AG), a relatively selective iNOS inhibitor. Direct measurements (mean +/- SEM) from allograft tissue indicated a fourfold increase in NO as compared with isografts (13.41 +/- 4.40 microM NO vs. 3.43 +/- 2.04 microM NO). Incubation of allograft tissue with AG reduced NO levels to isograft levels (13.41 +/- 4.40 microM NO vs. 5.94 +/- 3.14 microM NO); AG had no effect on measured isograft NO levels. Direct, quantitative measurement of NO from tissue is feasible and reproducible, and discrimination between different levels of NO production can be made.

We evaluated the applicability of the technique on RNA extracted from human endomyocardial biopsies and isolated cardiomyocytes, and compared the technique to the RT-competitive PCR approach. Primers and probes were designed to amplify the three subtypes of human beta -adrenoceptors (beta1-, beta2- and beta3 AR), as well as reference genes such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), and the oncogene ABL by real-time RT-PCR. Specific primers and a deleted competitor were synthetized to compare the quantitation of the beta 3 AR mRNA expression by RT-competitive PCR. We validated the technique on human cardiomyocytes either freshly isolated or selectively excised from fixed sections of human myocardium by Laser Capture Microdissection. The standard curves obtained for the cDNA's analysed showed mean slopes comprised between -3.3 and -3.7.

When compared with healthy controls, transplant recipients had tachycardia at rest (126 +/- 3.7 beats/min; p < 0.001); significantly reduced tolerance (9.3 +/- 0.4 min; p < 0.001), a maximum heart rate of 169 +/- 5.4 beats/min (p < 0.05); a cardiac output of 5.65 +/- 0.6 L/min (p < 0.05); and a lower heart-rate increase from rest to peak exercise (p < 0.001) but a similar VO2 peak. The heart-rate increase correlated significantly with time post-transplant (r = 0.55; p < 0.05), number of rejection episodes per year (r = - 0.63; p < 0.05), and number of immunosuppressive drugs (r = - 0.60; p < 0.05). The recipients had normal FVC and FEV1 values. After surgery, few heart transplant recipients undertake physical activity, possibly owing to over-protective parents and teachers and to a lack of suitable supervised facilities. The authors stress the importance of a cardiorespiratory functional evaluation for assessment of health status and to encourage recipients, if possible, to undertake regular physical activity.

Using a alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase wild-type (GalT(+/+)) to deficient (GalT(-/-)) mouse bone marrow transplantation model, we have previously demonstrated that a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen is capable of permitting induction of allogeneic and xenogeneic mixed chimerism. Chimerism is associated with the rapid and lasting tolerization of anti-Gal alpha 1,3Gal (Gal) natural antibody (Ab)-producing B cells. However, one limitation of this model is that anti-Gal natural Ab levels are lower in GalT(-/-) mice than in humans and other primates. To overcome this limitation, we have now investigated the possibility of inducing such tolerance in GalT(-/-) mice that produce much higher levels of anti-Gal Abs due to presensitization with Gal-bearing xenogeneic cells. B6 GalT(-/-) mice that were pre-sensitized with rabbit red blood cells received non-myeloablative conditioning with depleting anti-CD4 and CD8 mAbs, 3Gy whole body and 7Gy thymic irradiation, and infusion of BALB/c GalT(+/+) bone marrow cells (BMC). Although engraftment of standard marrow doses was inhibited by the presensitization, long-lasting mixed chimerism could be induced in recipients of a high dose [160 x 10(6)] of allogeneic wild-type BMC. Achievement of persistent chimerism was associated with high levels of anti-Gal IgG(1) pretransplant, suggesting an inhibitory effect of non-complement-fixing IgG(1) Ab on anti-Gal-mediated marrow rejection. Induction of mixed chimerism was associated with a rapid disappearance of serum anti-Gal and tolerization of anti-Gal Ab-producing cells. B cells with anti-Gal receptors became undetectable in mixed chimeras. Mixed chimeras accepted subsequently transplanted donor-type GalT(+/+) hearts (> 140 days), whereas rapid (within 2 days) rejection of GalT(+/+) hearts occurred in conditioned control GalT(-/-) mice. In conclusion, when a high dose of GalT(+/+) BMC was administered to pre-sensitized GalT(-/-) mice, chimerism and tolerance were achieved. The absence of B cells with receptors recognizing Gal in mixed chimeras suggests a role for clonal deletion/receptor editing in the maintenance of B cell tolerance.

Antibodies play a crucial role in the rejection of xenografts. We tested the hypothesis that xenografts are protected against antibody-mediated attack early after transplantation in a concordant model. We investigated the role of xenoreactive antibodies as a stimulus for protection and the effects of a total blockade of the antibody response by the leflunomide analog malononitrilamide 279. Hamster cardiac xenografts were transplanted to Lewis rat recipients. Second transplants and retransplants of xenografts were performed to untreated rats that had a xenograft in place for 3 d. Untreated rats rejected hamster cardiac xenografts after 4.0 +/- 0.0 d. Significant levels of anti-donor IgM, as measured by flowcytometry, were present on day 3 after transplantation (11.2% +/- 2.8 vs. 1.2% +/- 0.0 on day 0, P < 0.001). 'Fresh' second xenografts transplanted to rats that had a first xenograft in place for 3 d and had anti-hamster antibodies, underwent hyperacute rejection. The first xenografts remained functioning. Xenografts that were removed on day 3 from untreated rats and then retransplanted remained functioning. Xenografts that were removed on d 3 from rats that had been treated with malononitrilamide 279, 15 mg/kg/d and were retransplanted underwent hyperacute rejection. IgM levels at the time of removal were 1.1% +/- 0.5 in these rats and not different from baseline (P = 0.96). We conclude that xenografts are protected against antibody-mediated damage early after transplantation. The presence of anti-donor antibodies might be an essential stimulus for the induction of protection. There seems to be a delicate balance between the injurious and protective effects of antibodies. Treatment strategies that are designed to block antibody formation completely might prevent the induction of protection.

The effects of pre-transplant blood transfusion vary from induction of antibodies and accelerated graft rejection, to prolonged survival and even tolerance. The beneficial 'transfusion effect' in allotransplantation is believed to be merely T-cell mediated. In xenotransplantation, T-cell independent mechanisms form a major hurdle. In this study we investigated the effects of pre-transplant hamster blood transfusion on the survival of hamster cardiac xenografts in T-cell deficient athymic nude rats. Nude rats rejected xenografts after 3.8 +/- 0.5 d (n = 8), and immunocompetent Lewis rats after 4.0 +/- 0.5 d (n = 8), following a similar IgM response (P = NS). Hamster blood transfusion 3 d before transplantation in nude rats led to an IgM response and long-term xenograft survival in 17/20. Timing was of importance: blood transfusion 7 d before transplantation resulted in 45% long-term xenograft survival (n = 20). Injection of purified hamster erythrocytes, leukocytes or minced heart also led to survival of xenografts for > 100 d in nude rats, but not in all cases. Second xenografts transplanted to long-term survivors did not provoke an IigM response, and were accepted for > 100 d (n = 4). Transfer of serum from long-term survivors to untreated nude rats resulted in survival of xenografts for > 100 d (n = 4). In Lewis rats pre-transplant blood transfusion induced hyperacute rejection of xenografts after 158 +/- 128 min (n = 8, P < 0.01). We conclude that pre-transplant hamster blood transfusion can induce long-term survival of hamster cardiac xenografts in T-cell deficient athymic nude rats. This blood transfusion effect is mediated by humoral factors and can be transferred by serum. Elucidation of underlying mechanisms might provide some insight into xenotransplantation nonresponsiveness of T-cell independent immunefactors.

In recent experiments, in which we compared hDAF transgenic rat hearts perfused with 15% human serum in the Langendorff device and hDAF rat hearts transplanted into cynomolgus monkeys, we demonstrated that in the ex vivo heart perfusion model both homozygous and heterozygous hDAF hearts survived longer as nontransgenic controls. Surprisingly, we found that only homozygous hDAF hearts were protected against hyperacute rejection in vivo. The first aim of this study was to determine whether perfusion of mouse hearts with higher human serum concentrations or human blood might explain some of the differences found in survival time of the recently performed experiments with rat heart xenografts. Secondly, we investigated whether the observed differences in survival times of rat xenografts between in vivo and ex vivo transplantation would also hold for mouse hearts transgenic for hDAF. An ex vivo model was used to perfuse hDAF mouse hearts and controls with human serum or blood, and hDAF transgenic hearts and controls were transplanted into cynomolgus monkeys. hDAF transgenic mouse hearts survived significantly longer than their controls when perfused with 15% human serum, but no difference was found when 30% human serum was used, or when these hearts were transplanted into cynomolgus monkeys. However, in both the in vivo and ex vivo models the amount of PMNs adhering to the vascular endothelium was significantly lower in hDAF transgenes as compared with their controls. In conclusion, in the ex vivo situation, the efficacy of hDAF transgenesis in preventing HAR is limited by serum complement concentration.

Immunoglobulin isotype switching represents an important component of antibody maturation in the development of humoral immune responses. We have recently conducted a series of studies in a nonimmunosuppressed rodent model to define the kinetics of xenoantibody production and seek evidence for the maturation of xenoantibody Ig gene expression by xenograft recipients. LEW rats were transplanted with hamster cardiac xenografts and the grafts were allowed to remain in situ for prolonged immune stimulation of the host. Anti-hamster antibodies were examined at days 4, 8, 21, 28 and 40 post-transplantation. cDNA libraries specific for rat mu or gamma heavy chains were constructed from B lymphocytes of the xenograft recipients at day 4 and day 21 post-transplantation. Selected cDNA clones encoding the Ig V(H)HAR family of genes from each group were sequenced and analyzed for the presence of somatic mutations. We found that the reactivity of xenoantibodies examined with flow cytometry underwent sequential changes in which IgM titers peaked at day 8 post-transplantation (PTx) and returned to low levels after 21 days. IgG titers started to increase at about one week PTx and peaked at 21-28 days. All the IgG isotypes (IgG1, 2a, 2b and 2c) were differentially involved in the IgG responses. Serum passive transfer experiments demonstrated that IgM antibody fractions separated from sera at day 4 post-transplantation were capable of causing hyperacute rejection (HAR) of hamster xenografts, whereas IgM fractions from days 21-40 failed to cause HAR (N = 7, MST = 4 days), a pattern that was consistent with a rise in total xenoreactive IgM levels at days 4-8 and a fall to low levels at 21 days post-transplantation. IgG-containing fractions separated from day 21-40 antisera caused HAR (N = 7, MST = 36 min) whereas IgG fractions from day 8 sera failed to induce graft rejection. Genetic analysis of the rearranged VH genes from 10 cDNA clones demonstrated that the Ig mu (n = 5) and gamma (n = 5) chain clones used the same family of VH genes (V(H)HAR family) to encode their antibody binding activity. The majority (80%) of the IgM clones were present in their original germline configuration. In contrast, the nucleotide sequences from IgG clones manifested an increase in the numbers of replacement mutations in the CDR region of the Ig heavy chain genes, providing evidence for a potential role for somatic mutation in the maturation of IgG xenoantibody responses as the humoral response matures with time post-transplantation.

The present study aimed to investigate the role of cellular immune response in the absence of membrane attack complex (MAC) formation in the concordant mouse-to-rat heart xenografting. Hearts from BALB/c mice were transplanted into the neck vessels of C6-competent (C6(+)) and C6-deficient (C6(-)) PVG rats. Liposome-encapsulated dichloro-methylene diphosphonate (Lip-Cl2MDP) was administered at a dose of 10 ml/kg 2 days before transplantation and every 5 days thereafter. Cyclosporine (CsA) was administered intramuscularly (i.m.) at a dose of 15 mg/kg per day. The heart xenografts were harvested for immuno-histological analysis at the time of rejection and the functioning grafts were removed at 70 days after transplantation. In untreated C6(+) rats, xeno-grafts survived for 2.3 +/- 0.5 days. Treatment with CsA or Lip-Cl(2)MDP in C6(+) rats did not significantly affect graft survival (2.5 +/- 0.6 and 2.3 +/- 0.4 days, respectively). In untreated C6(-) rats, xenografts survived for 5.0 +/- 0.6 days. However, Lip-Cl(2)MDP in C6(-) rats resulted in a prolongation of graft survival to 11 +/- 2.3 days (P < 0.05 vs. untreated C6(-) rats), while treatment with CsA alone in these rats led to more than 70 days' survival in four out of six grafts (61 +/- 16 days). In untreated C6(+) rats, immunohistology showed a severe myocardial necrosis and thrombosis with a scarce cellular infiltrate in the rejected xenografts. By contrast, in untreated C6(-) rats, xenografts were heavily infiltrated by macrophages and T cells. The number of macrophages, but not T cells, was markedly reduced in Lip-Cl(2)MDP-treated rats. In CsA-treated C6(-) rats, the grafts harvested at 70 days after transplantation had a normal morphology, with a minimal cellular infiltrate. Our data indicate that MAC-mediated injury plays an essential role in concordant xenograft rejection. Once this mechanism has been prevented, suppression of T cells allows for long-term xenograft survival.

Allotransplantation was performed in the Dark Agouti-to-Lewis (DA-to-Lewis; kidney, heart, and aorta) and Brown Norway-to-Lewis (BN-to-Lewis; kidney) strain combinations, and hamster heart xenotransplantation was performed in athymic and euthymic Lewis rats. The compounds were administered daily orally, starting the day of transplantation. In kidney and heart transplantation the minimal efficacious dose of CsA was 5.0 mg/kg/d. For MPS this dose was 10 mg/kg/d in BN-to-Lewis kidney transplantation, 20 mg/kg/d in DA-to-Lewis heart transplantation, and 10 mg/kg/d in hamster-to-athymic rat heart transplantation. At these doses the first signs of adverse effects were evident, indicating a narrow therapeutic window. No window was established for MMF in these models or for MPS in DA-to-Lewis kidney transplantation. There was no potential synergy between CsA and MPS or MMF regarding efficacy, but fewer side effects were noted in efficacious combinations, in particular for MPS. In aorta transplantation, MPS and MMF dose-dependently inhibited intima thickening. The combination of 20 mg/kg/d MPS and 10 mg/kg/d CsA gave long-term survival of hamster-to-rat xenografts. Despite the overall comparable efficacy and narrow therapeutic window of MPS and MMF when given alone, MPS apparently is better tolerated than MMF in some of the transplant models. The combination of these agents with CsA allows fine-tuning between optimal immunosuppression and adverse side effects.

Naturally occurring antibodies (Nabs) that bind to terminal galactose alpha1,3-galactose carbohydrate structures (Gal) are present in humans and Old World monkeys but are negatively regulated in other mammalian species because they express Gal epitopes on their cell surfaces. A Gal knockout mouse (Gal-/-) model, generated by homologous disruption of alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase gene, is capable of producing natural anti-Gal Abs. To study the genetic control of the anti-Gal response, we have generated anti-Gal hybridomas from Gal-/- mice and analyzed VH genes of anti-Gal Abs from na\u00efve animals and from mice stimulated by rat heterotopic heart transplantation. Six immunoglobulin (Ig)M anti-Gal hybridomas derived from na\u00efve Gal-/- mice exhibited anti-Gal binding activity with some cross-reactivity to related carbohydrate structures. These na\u00efve anti-Gal Abs used five different VH genes in a germline configuration. Anti-Gal IgM hybridomas isolated after a rat heterotopic heart xenograft (4 days) utilized germline VH gene segments from the VH7183 family and exhibited less cross-reactivity. In contrast to mice 4 days after xenograft, we have predominantly isolated IgG anti-Gal hybridomas from mice 21 days after rat heterotopic heart xenografts, indicating an isotype switch. Nine of the IgG anti-Gal hybridomas secreted IgG3 subclass and one produced IgG1. Sequence analysis of the VH gene usage from the induced anti-Gal IgG antibodies demonstrated a restricted gene utilization (VHJ606-V14A). Our results demonstrate that the anti-Gal response in na\u00efve Gal-/- mice is encoded by multiple germline progenitors. In response to a xenograft, the induced anti-Gal Abs exhibited a restricted gene usage and somatic mutations, indicating a positive selection.

Cyclosporine nephropathy (CyAN) is a major limiting factor in the otherwise successful widespread use of cyclosporine in solid organ transplant. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) has been implicated as an important fibrogenic cytokine in the development of this disease. TGF-beta-inducible gene-H3 (beta(ig)-H3) is a TGF-beta1- induced gene product, which acts as a marker for biologically active TGF-beta1. This study reports TGF-beta1 gene expression and beta(ig)-H3 tissue distribution in non-renal allograft CyAN. Renal tissue from nine patients who had developed CyAN after successful heart or heart-lung transplantation and from four kidneys removed for tumour were analyzed for TGF-beta1 gene expression beta(ig)-H3 protein with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. TGF-beta1 gene expression was increased in CyAN compared to nephrectomy (P<0.0001). Beta(ig)-H3 protein expression was identified in distal convoluted tubular epithelium and parietal glomerular epithelium in CyAN, and not in nephrectomy samples. Expression of TGF-beta1 mRNA was significantly higher in renal tissue from patients not receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy for hypertension (P<0.05).

While left ventricular assist devices have clinically proven benefit, their use in geriatric patients raises ethical issues. Where these devices are currently not approved as destination therapy, their use must be reflected upon in conjunction with allograft transplantation. Age-based organ allocation policies could facilitate left ventricular assist devices as a bridge to nowhere for some geriatric patients. Specifically, the extended use of a left ventricular assist device by older patients could, in theory, put them in a position of not being able to get an allograft due to the fact that they have aged while on the waiting list. Unless these devices are approved as destination therapy, or age-based organ allocation policies contain exception clauses, an older person's cardiac dilemma could be confounded as an assist device recipient.

Although 677C-->T transition in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is associated with increased homocysteine levels in the general population, it is unclear whether MTHFR polymorphism influences homocysteine metabolism after heart transplant. Homocysteine, serum folate, renal function, concentrations of cyclosporine and its metabolites, and MTHFR genotype were determined in 57 heart transplant recipients (age, 55 +/- 11 yr; 21% women; time from transplant, 48 +/- 42 months). Forty nine percent of the study population presented with hyperhomocysteinemia. Homocysteine was 17.1 +/- 5.9 micromol/liter, 19.4 +/- 4.9 micromol/liter, and 26.3 +/- 14.2 micromol/liter for genotypes CC, CT, and TT, respectively (p = 0.028, Kruskal-Wallis test).

The vasculoprotective effects of estrogen are well-established not only in women with age-related atherosclerosis, but also after experimental vascular injury and in chronic allograft vasculopathy. Evidence exists that the newly discovered estrogen receptor (ER) beta, rather than the classical ERalpha is related to the vasculoprotective effect. Here we investigate whether and to what extent the two ERs are expressed in cardiac allografts in the rat and human in native state and during acute and chronic rejection. Rat cardiac allografts were performed from male DA (AG-B4, RT1(a)) to male WF (AG-B2, RT1(v)) strain and syngeneic transplants from DA to DA strain; human male-to-male heart allograft endomyocardial biopsies came from our biopsy files. Under in situ hybridization, ERbeta mRNA was prominently expressed in rat vessels and stroma, whereas ERalpha mRNA was present in low levels only. In immunohistochemistry, 2 ERbeta-specific antibodies stained rat and human vessels and stroma, whereas only a weak or no signal was obtained with 2 ERalpha-specific antibodies. Interestingly, the mRNA and protein expression levels in the rat carried only a weak correlation with the intensity of acute rejection, i.e., was not related to the intensity of inflammation. Our results demonstrate that ERbeta is the predominant ER in rat and human cardiac allografts, and suggest that, unless additional ERs are identified, the vasculoprotective effects of estrogen derivatives in cardiac allograft vasculopathy are mediated by ERbeta rather than by the classical ERalpha.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) has been implicated in cardiovascular disease. Polymorphism of the TNF-alpha gene promoter region (position -308) influences an individual's production of TNF-alpha. This affects susceptibility to acute rejection after cardiac transplantation. Because the highest serum levels of TNF-alpha have been found in recipients with cardiac transplant vasculopathy and because TNF-alpha blockade can prevent the disease in rabbits, we investigated the effect of TNF-alpha promoter polymorphism on the development of vasculopathy in human cardiac allograft recipients. Using sequence-specific primers to the TNF-alpha gene and polymerase chain reaction, the genotypes of 147 cardiac transplant recipients and 134 heart donors were identified. An association was sought between the presence of high-producing (A homozygotes, GA heterozygotes) or low-producing (G homozygotes) TNF-alpha genotype and the development of coronary vasculopathy, diagnosed by routine surveillance coronary angiography. We found that 31.9% of recipients and 27.0% of donors were high TNF-alpha producers. The presence of the high-producing TNF-alpha allele led to an earlier diagnosis of vasculopathy; 3.42 years (+/- 91.3 days) vs 3.84 years (+/- 76.3 days) for high- and low-producing cardiac graft recipients, respectively; 3.52 years (+/- 87.3 days) vs 3.78 years (+/- 77.4 days) for high- and low-producing donor grafts, respectively. However, neither of these differences were significant. By Kaplan Meier actuarial analysis and log-rank test, TNF-alpha polymorphism had no effect on the freedom from vasculopathy when considering either recipient (p = 0.99) or donor (p = 0.86) TNF-alpha genotype. Multivariate analysis identified increasing donor age and the number of acute rejection episodes of International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade 3 or greater as independent risk factors for vasculopathy in both the recipient and donor cohorts.

This may be advantageous for the treatment of heart failure patients. Therefore, the present study investigates the mode of action of levosimendan in both failing and nonfailing (NF) human myocardium. The effects of levosimendan on contractile force, Ca(2+) transient (fura 2), and the force-frequency relationship (0.5-3 Hz) were studied in left ventricular terminally failing [dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM; n = 18)] and nonfailing (NF) myocardium (donor hearts, n = 6). Levosimendan (0.03-10 micromol/l) increased contractile force in NF (EC(50): 0.38 micromol/l). In left ventricular failing myocardium, levosimendan only increased force after prestimulation with isoprenaline (0.1 micromol/l, EC(50) levosimendan: 0.062 micromol/l) or after elevation of the extracellular Ca(2+) concentration from 1.8 to 3.2 mmol/l. After application of isoprenaline, levosimendan shortened relaxation and contraction kinetics. Levosimendan did not change the systolic Ca(2+) transient but it improved the force-frequency relationship in DCM. In conclusion, levosimendan improves contraction in failing human myocardium under conditions with already increased intracellular Ca(2+).

Coronary endothelial dysfunction may be an early marker for cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) in orthotopic heart transplant recipients. Using serial studies with intravascular ultrasound and Doppler flow-wire measurements, we have previously demonstrated that annual decrements in coronary endothelial function are associated with progressive intimal thickening. The present study tested whether endothelial dysfunction predicts subsequent clinical events, including cardiac death and CAV development. Seventy-three patients were studied yearly beginning at transplantation until a prespecified end point was reached. End points were angiographic evidence of CAV (>50% stenosis) or cardiac death (graft failure or sudden death). At each study, coronary endothelial function was measured with intracoronary infusions of adenosine (32-microgram bolus), acetylcholine (54 microgram over 2 minutes), and nitroglycerin (200 microgram) into the left anterior descending coronary artery; intravascular ultrasound images and Doppler velocities were recorded simultaneously. Of the 73 patients studied, 14 reached an end point during the study (6 CAV and 8 deaths, including 4 with known CAV, 1 graft failure, and 3 sudden). On the last study performed, the group with an end point had decreased epicardial (constriction of 11.1+/-2.9% versus dilation of 1.7+/-2.2%, P=0.01) and microvascular (flow increase of 75+/-20% versus 149+/-16%, P=0.03) endothelium-dependent responses to acetylcholine compared with the patients who did not reach an end point. Responses to adenosine and nitroglycerin did not differ significantly. Endothelial dysfunction, as detected by abnormal responses to acetylcholine, preceded the development of clinical end points. These data implicate endothelial dysfunction in the development of clinically significant vasculopathy and suggest that serial studies of endothelial function have clinical utility.

Cyclosporin A (CsA) is commonly measured by immunoassay techniques that have a limited analytical range. The consequence of this is that low CsA concentrations that may be clinically significant are difficult to measure and that high concentrations require sample dilution, which introduces error and increases cost. More specific assays, such as HPLC, do not have the required turnaround times for busy transplant clinics. CsA was measured in whole blood from 180 cardiac and lung transplant recipients by a liquid chromatography--tandem mass spectrometry (MS) assay, and the results were compared with the Dade Behring Emit assay. Proteins were precipitated with acetonitrile containing ascomycin as internal standard. We used isocratic elution on a Supelco CN column (33 x 3.0 mm; 3- microm bead size) with a mobile phase of 65% aqueous acetonitrile containing ammonium acetate (2 mmol/L) and formic acid (1 g/L), at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, with a sample injection volume of 6 microL. We used positive-ion electrospray MS to monitor the ammonium adducts of the compounds of interest decomposing under controlled conditions to the most dominant fragments of the individual molecules. Calibration curves used linear least-squares regression with 1/x weighting. Maximum sensitivity was obtained by monitoring fragmentation of the ammonium adducts m/z 1220-->m/z 1203 for CsA and m/z 809-->m/z 765 for ascomycin. Sample throughput, including preparation time, was 30 samples in 1.5 h with an injection-to-injection cycle time of 1.5 min. The calibration curve was linear to 5000 microg/L, with a detection limit of 0.03 microg/L and a limit of quantification of 1 microg/L. Regression analysis [tandem MS method (y) and Emit assay (x)] yielded a slope of 1.09 (+/- 0.03), an intercept of 6.2 (+/- 4.5) microg/L, and S(y/x) = 27 microg/L.

CD8alpha+ and CD8alpha- dendritic cells (DCs) arise from committed bone marrow progenitors and can induce or regulate immune reactivity. Previously, the maturational status of CD8alpha-(myeloid) DCs has been shown to influence allogeneic T cell responses and allograft survival. Although CD8alpha+ DCs have been implicated in central tolerance and found to modulate peripheral T cell function, their influence on the outcome of organ transplantation has not been examined. Consistent with their equivalent high surface expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules, sorted mature C57BL/10J (B10; H2(b)) DCs of either subset primed naive, allogeneic C3H/HeJ (C3H; H2(k)) recipients for Th1 responses. Paradoxically and in contrast to their CD8alpha- counterparts, mature CD8alpha+ B10 DCs given systemically 7 days before transplant markedly prolonged B10 heart graft survival in C3H recipients. This effect was associated with specific impairment of ex vivo antidonor T cell proliferative responses, which was not reversed by exogenous IL-2. Further analyses of possible underlying mechanisms indicated that neither immune deviation nor induction of regulatory cells was a significant contributory factor. In contrast to the differential capacity of the mature DC subsets to affect graft outcome, immature CD8alpha+ and CD8alpha- DCs administered under the same experimental conditions significantly prolonged transplant survival. These observations demonstrate for the first time the innate capacity of CD8alpha+ DCs to regulate alloimmune reactivity and transplant survival, independent of their maturation status. Mobilization of such a donor DC subset with capacity to modulate antidonor immunity may have significant implications for the therapy of allograft rejection.

TNF-alpha and lymphotoxin (LT)alpha have been shown to be important mediators of allograft rejection. TNF-R1 is the principal receptor for both molecules. Mice with targeted genetic deletions of TNF-R1 demonstrate normal development of T and B lymphocytes but exhibit functional defects in immune responses. However, the role of TNF-R1-mediated signaling in solid organ transplant rejection has not been defined. To investigate this question, we performed vascularized heterotopic allogeneic cardiac transplants in TNF-R1-deficient (TNF-R1(-/-)) and wild-type mice. Because all allografts in our protocol expressed TNF-R1, direct antigraft effects of TNF-alpha and LTalpha were not prevented. However, immunoregulatory effects on recipient inflammatory cells by TNF-R1 engagement was eliminated in TNF-R1(-/-) recipients. In our study, cardiac allograft survival was significantly prolonged in TNF-R1(-/-) recipients. Despite this prolonged allograft survival, we detected increased levels of CD8 T cell markers in allografts from TNF-R1(-/-) recipients, suggesting that effector functions, but not T cell recruitment, were blocked. We also demonstrated the inhibition of multiple chemokines and cytokines in allografts from TNF-R1(-/-) recipients including RANTES, IFN-inducible protein-10, lymphotactin, and IL-1R antagonist, as well as altered levels of chemokine receptors. We correlated gene expression with the physiologic process of allograft rejection using self-organizing maps and identified distinct patterns of gene expression in allografts from TNF-R1(-/-) recipients. These findings indicate that in our experimental system TNF-alpha and LTalpha exert profound immunoregulatory effects through TNF-R1.

Accelerated coronary arteriosclerosis remains a major problem for the long-term survival of cardiac transplant recipients. However, the pathogenesis of graft vasculopathy is poorly understood and there is no effective therapy. Tranilast is a promising drug that may prevent post-angioplasty restenosis. Here, we investigated whether orally administered tranilast inhibits the development of intima hyperplasia in a mouse model of cardiac transplantation. Cardiac allografts from BALB/c mice were transplanted heterotopically into C3H/He mice. Mice were administered either vehicle or tranilast everyday by gavage. Morphometrical analysis of the cardiac allografts harvested at 2 months revealed that the administration of tranilast significantly reduced the development of coronary atherosclerosis. In the mice treated with tranilast, up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 was observed in the allografts, accompanied by a reduced number of proliferating cells. Tranilast also suppressed transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) expression.

It is hard to better the descriptions of William Heberden: There is a disorder of the breast, marked with strong and peculiar symptoms, considerable for the danger belonging to it.... Those who are afflicted with it are seized, while they are walking, and more particularly when they walk soon after eating, with a painful and most disagreeable sensation in the breast.... the moment they stand still all this uneasiness vanishes. After it has continued some months, it will not cease so instantaneous upon standing still ...

But the natural tendency of this illness be to kill the patients suddenly.... The os sterni is usually pointed to as the seat of this malady ... and sometimes there is with it a pain about the middle of the left arm. The usual cause of myocardial ischaemia is coronary atherosclerosis. Other diseases of the coronary arteries (emboli, spasm, vasculitis, Kawasaki disease, congenital anomalies), other cardiac diseases (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe hypertension, severe aortic valve disease), and high output states (severe anaemia, thyrotoxicosis) are all uncommon or rare causes of angina. However, while angina is usually associated with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, the converse is not always true. The condition of coronary atherosclerosis is very common (fatty streaks and more advanced plaques are almost universal in adults in industrialised countries) but it does not always cause myocardial ischaemia. Furthermore, myocardial ischaemia may present other than with angina - for each presentation there is a wide differential diagnosis.

Insomnia in patients with heart transplantation and cardiac disease is a common problem. Organic factors, immunodepressant medication (e.g. ciclosporine and steroids) and psychological factors may account for this symptom. The article reviews different hypnotic drugs and their value in the treatment of insomnia. For short-time treatment, medication with benzodiazepine hypnotics may be useful. If the problems of drug dependence and rebound insomnia are taken into consideration, treatment with non-benzodiazepine hypnotics offers more safety and comfort. If insomnia is part of a depressive syndrome, pharmacotherapeutical intervention with antidepressive sedative medication is required. With regard to cardiac disease, treatment with mirtazapine, nefazodone or trazodone should be preferred because of the chinidine-like effect of tricyclic antidepressants (TCA). Sedative neuroleptic medication (e.g. melperone) is commonly given to geriatric patients; nevertheless, patients with chronic insomnia may also benefit from this medication. The risks and benefits of hypnotic drugs are discussed especially in relation to pharmacological interaction (cytochrome system) and cardiac disease.

We previously characterized a facilitating cell (FC) in mouse marrow that enables engraftment of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) without causing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The FC shares some cell surface molecules with T cells (Thy1+, CD3epsilon+, CD8+, CD5+, and CD2+) but is T-cell receptor (TCR) negative. Historically, depletion of CD3+ or CD8+ cells from rat marrow was associated with an increased rate of failure of engraftment. In this study, we evaluated whether depletion of alphabeta- and gammadelta-TCR(+) T cells from donor marrow would retain engraftment potential yet avoid GVHD. Wistar-Furth rats were conditioned with 950 cGy of total body irradiation and transplanted with ACI bone marrow processed to remove either alphabeta-TCR(+), gammadelta-TCR(+), or alphabeta- plus gammadelta-TCR(+) T cells. Recipients were typed for chimerism at 28 days and monthly thereafter. Recipients of marrow depleted of alphabeta- (group A), gammadelta- (group B), or alphabeta- and gammadelta-TCR(+) T cells (group C) engrafted and had an average chimerism level of 73.0+/-8.3%, 92.3+/-9.2%, and 46.3+/-32.8%, respectively. Aggressive T-cell depletion did not remove the FC population (CD8+/CD3+/TCR(-)). Group A and group B both developed GVHD, with a higher incidence of GVHD in group B compared to group A. None of the recipients in group C developed GVHD. These data demonstrate that depletion of T cells from rat marrow does not impair engraftment of HSCs, indirectly supporting the existence of FCs in rat marrow. Moreover, donor alphabeta- and gammadelta-TCR(+) T cells contribute to GVHD in a nonredundant fashion, although alphabeta-TCR(+) T cells are more potent as the effector cells. Finally, the level of donor chimerism is influenced by the composition of the graft, because recipients of marrow that contain alphabeta-TCR(+) T cells exhibited significantly higher donor chimerism compared to recipients of marrow depleted of both alphabeta- and gammadelta-TCR(+) T cells.

Tolerance was achieved by transplantation of CTLA4Ig-transduced ACI liver allografts in Lewis recipients. Recipient long-term survivors received a second transplant, consisting of a cervical heterotopic heart from the same ACI donor strain. Animals were sacrificed at predetermined intervals following the second transplant and the heart and liver were processed for histology and cytokine mRNA expression.

The cytokine cascade was activated within the allografts; however, the pattern of acceptance was not associated with predominance of a specific Th subtype. The pattern of acceptance of an allograft following CTLA4Ig-mediated costimulatory blockade is not related to long-term predominance of Th2 cells, a phenomenon that may be unique to the setting of a tolerant liver.

However, their efficacy to regulate immunological responses in vivo remains unclear. Here, we report that repetitive intraperitoneal injection of recombinant Lewis rat-derived MHC class I antigens in Dark Agouti (DA) rats modulates alloreactivity. RT1.A1 (Lewis derived) genes were cloned into mammalian expression vectors, and RT1.Aa (DA derived) genes were used to transfect a rat myeloma cell line. RT1.A1 molecules were injected intraperitoneally in DA recipients that subsequently underwent transplantation with Lewis-derived cardiac allografts. Soluble class I antigens were secreted by the transfected cells and were shown to be heterodimeric, peptide-loaded, and conformationally folded. Injection of donor-derived soluble MHC significantly reduced the ability of recipient animals to mount a cytotoxic T-cell response to donor-derived tissue. More interestingly, this treatment significantly prolonged donor-graft survival and allowed 60% of treated animals to develop graft tolerance (>120 days), when donor sMHC were combined with a single subtherapeutic dosage of cyclosporine. Thymectomy of recipient animals before transplantation did not interfere with induction of peripheral tolerance. Donor-derived sMHC are potential tolerogens for down-regulating the cytotoxic T-cell response of animals that undergo transplantation.

The pretransplant group included 45 patients (average age, 38 months) supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and listed for transplantation (31 heart, 8 lung, and 6 heart-lung), and the post-transplant group included 20 patients (average age, 83 months) who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation after thoracic organ transplantation (12 heart, 6 lung, and 2 heart-lung transplants). Hospital course and outcomes were evaluated. With regard to pretransplant extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, patients listed for heart transplants were more likely to survive to transplantation than were those listed for lung or heart-lung transplants (12/31 [39%] vs 1/14 [7%], P =.03). There was no difference in long-term survival between heart transplant patients after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and those without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (12-month actuarial survival, 83% vs 73%; P =.68). Patients who survived for prolonged periods on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (>250 hours) typically received heart transplants (7/8 [88%]). With regard to post-transplant extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, patients receiving lung or heart-lung transplants had better short-term outcomes than those receiving heart transplants (63% survived to discharge vs 33%). All 3 patients with early graft dysfunction receiving lung transplants survived to discharge. Long-term outcomes among those undergoing heart transplantation after support with an extracorporeal membrane oxygenator are comparable with those of patients not receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be a useful post-transplant support device, particularly in patients undergoing lung transplants. ", "label": 0}{"text": "[Cellular polarization].

Clinical and experimental evidence demonstrating the effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in patients with heart failure continues to accumulate. It is well established that high concentrations of TNF-alpha appear in the circulation of patients with heart failure and that these levels have a directly proportional correlation with the patient's functional class. TNF-alpha levels also show a linear relation with prognosis. These circulating levels are responsible for the decreased expression of myocardial TNF-alpha receptors observed in heart failure. As a result of extrapolation of findings from experimental animals, we assume that TNF-alpha is deleterious to myocardial function in humans because it induces a negative inotropic state in patients who have not undergone heart transplant. Supporting this assumption is the fact that the resolution or improvement of pressure overload (obstructive hypertrophic myocardiopathy, by ethanol ablation) and volume overload (terminal dilated myocardiopathy, by ventricular assistance) states is accompanied by a decrease in myocardial TNF-alpha expression. The use of specific antagonists of circulating TNF-alpha in patients with symptomatic heart failure has been demonstrated to be safe and possibly effective. At present, multicenter studies are under way to assess the efficacy of this antagonism in a larger number of patients. If the results of these studies are favorable, we will have new therapeutic elements for managing patients with advanced hear failure. The transplanted heart behaves differently from the native heart. From the early stages of HTx, myocardial TNF-alpha expression is greatly increased (much more than in patients with heart failure) and not associated with contractile dysfunction, in contrast with what occurs in the native heart. However, we know that the transplanted heart soon develops ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, and late graft failure, even in the presence of normal epicardial coronary arteries. Clinical evidence suggests that TNF-alpha may be involved in these processes. ", "label": 0}{"text": "Poly(ADP-Ribose) polymerase inhibition reduces reperfusion injury after heart transplantation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the novel poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor PJ34 (N-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-phenanthridin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylacetamide) on myocardial and endothelial function after hypothermic ischemia and reperfusion in a heterotopic rat heart transplantation model. After a 1-hour ischemic preservation, reperfusion was started either after application of placebo or PJ34 (3 mg/kg). The assessment of left ventricular pressure-volume relations, total coronary blood flow, endothelial function, myocardial high energy phosphates, and histological analysis were performed at 1 and 24 hours of reperfusion. After 1 hour, myocardial contractility and relaxation, coronary blood flow, and endothelial function were significantly improved and myocardial high energy phosphate content was preserved in the PJ34-treated animals. Improved transplant function was also seen with treatment with another, structurally different PARP inhibitor, 5-aminoisoquinoline. The PARP inhibitors did not affect baseline cardiac function. Immunohistological staining confirmed that PJ34 prevented the activation of PARP in the transplanted hearts. The activation of P-selectin and ICAM-1 was significantly elevated in the vehicle-treated heart transplantation group. Thus, pharmacological PARP inhibition reduces reperfusion injury after heart transplantation due to prevention of energy depletion and downregulation of adhesion molecules and exerts a beneficial effect against reperfusion-induced graft coronary endothelial dysfunction.

The prevalence and severity of apoptosis is determined predominantly by the intensity of macrophage infiltration and may be mediated by NO-related mechanisms. Apoptosis of interstitial, endothelial, and inflammatory cells is also present in heart allografts and may influence the degree and extent of vascular injury contributing to allograft rejection. Ongoing apoptosis of inflammatory cells suggests an immunoregulatory role. Studies of the involvement of NO in myocyte damage and Fas-FasL interactions in peripheral tolerance have raised the exciting possibility that these pathways can be exploited in a beneficial way. Further understanding of the role of apoptosis and the cellular and biochemical mechanisms that are involved in cardiac myocyte death and in inflammatory, endothelial, and interstitial cell death may provide insights into therapeutic modalities to suppress allograft rejection and vasculopathy.

Specimens had been analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and/or Southern blot for T-cell and B-cell (immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain genes) gene rearrangements (BGR). The categories for PTLDs were as follows: 1, 1; 2, 6; and 3, 4. The plasmacytic and polymorphic B-cell hyperplasias (PBCHs) revealed no monoclonal/aberrant cells by FCI or genotypic studies (GS). Three of 4 polymorphic B-cell lymphomas (PBCLs) revealed monoclonal or aberrant (no surface light chain) B cells by FCI; 1 of 3 revealed a BGR. However, the 1 case with no monoclonal/aberrant B cells by FCI revealed a BGR. Both immunoblastic lymphomas revealed monoclonal or aberrant B cells by FCI; 1 revealed a BGR. Both multiple myelomas revealed monoclonal plasma cells by FCI; 1 revealed a BGR. In the 4 PTLDs with monoclonal/aberrant B cells by FCI and no clonality detected by GS, the GS were performed on fresh and paraffin-embedded tissue samples. FCI of the plasmacytic and PBCHs supported no clonal process by GS. FCI defined a clonal process in 2 PBCLs, I immunoblastic lymphoma, and 1 multiple myeloma that were negative by GS. However, 1 PBCL that was polyclonal by FCI was monoclonal by GS. Thus, FCI is useful for identifying a clonal process in PTLDs with negative results by GS; FCI and GS should be performed routinely in PTLDs to detect a clonal process.

Heart-lung transplantation (HLT) for Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) provides superior early and intermediate survival when compared with other forms of transplantation. The early risk factors and long-term outcome of HLT for ES are less well defined. We analyzed 263 patients who had undergone HLT at our institution during more than 15 years. Fifty-one consecutive patients with ES who underwent HLT, 33 (65%) of which had simple anatomy, were compared with 212 cases having HLT for other indications (non-ES). Female sex and previous thoracotomy were more prevalent in the ES group. Patients with ES had greater postoperative blood loss and returned more frequently to the operating room for control of bleeding. There were 8 (16%) early deaths in the ES group compared with 27 (13%) in non-ES (p = 0.65). One-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates for ES were 72.6%, 51.3%, and 27.6%, respectively, compared with non-ES of 74.1%, 48.1%, and 26.0%, respectively, and there was no difference in survival overall (p = 0.54). Among ES patients, previous thoracotomy was a risk factor for hospital death. A subgroup analysis based on simple versus complex type of ES did not show statistically significant differences in terms of postoperative course or early or late survival. Heart-lung transplantation is a successful procedure for ES. Despite a greater frequency of risk factors and a more difficult operative course, early and late outcome with HLT is comparable to non-ES recipients.

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate nifedipine-induced epicardial and microvascular response in human coronary arteries with and without endothelial dysfunction and intimal thickening. The investigation was performed in 70 patients 5 +/- 5 months after heart transplantation. Coronary vasomotor function was determined with intracoronary acetylcholine adenosine, and nifedipine, respectively. Intravascular ultrasound was used to detect significant intimal hyperplasia. In a subgroup (n = 38), coronary sinus and aortic endothelin concentrations were determined. Epicardial dilation to nifedipine was significantly enhanced in coronary arteries with endothelial dysfunction (p = 0.04), whereas adenosine-induced epicardial dilation was attenuated in segments with endothelial dysfunction (p = 0.002). In cases of intimal hyperplasia, nifedipine-mediated distal vasodilation was increased compared with normal segments (p = 0.03). Coronary flow index nifedipine was enhanced in patients with microvascular endothelial dysfunction (p = 0.037). A trend was observed between high endothelin plasma levels in the coronary sinus and an increased microvasodilation to nifedipine (p = 0.04). The study shows that epicardial and microvascular dilation to nifedipine is enhanced in the setting of coronary endothelial dysfunction, suggesting supersensitive dilator response. The association between microvascular response to nifedipine and endothelin levels in the coronary sinus needs further clarification.

The human body releases endogenous nitric oxide (NO) from three main sources: neurons, inflammatory processes (induced NO) and endothelium. The chemical industry produces NO by reacting sulfur dioxide and nitric acid, or sodium nitrite and sulfuric acid, or by oxidation of ammonia. Inhaled NO acts on smooth muscle cells of the pulmonary endothelium, causing relaxation by stimulation of guanylate-cyclase. The short half life of NO and its immediate breakdown into hemodynamically inactive but toxic metabolites make this drug a selective pulmonary vasodilator that can decrease pulmonary arterial pressure, improving right ventricular ejection fraction while decreasing intrapulmonary shunt and improving oxygenation.NO has demonstrated its usefulness in treating right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension after heart surgery, especially in the transplanted patient. Doses have usually ranged from 5 to 20 parts per million. However, great individual variability in response to NO has been reported. Between 30 and 40% of patients do not respond to treatment. NO is also used to assess the reversibility of chronic pulmonary hypertension in patients who are candidates for heart transplants.

The amelioration of damage by rinsing the graft before re-warming and transplantation was also examined. Rat donor hearts were preserved for 2 hr (0 degrees C) as follows: Series A was preserved with colloid-free UW (MUW), St. Thomas' solution (ST), or calcium-supplemented MUW (MUW+Ca) followed by either transplantation or warming (22 degrees C) for 10 min before transplantation. Series B was preserved with MUW, rinsed with fresh MUW, ST, MUW+Ca, or low-potassium MUW before warming and transplantation. All heart isografts were transplanted heterotopically with an indwelling left intraventricular balloon-tipped catheter. Graft function was measured 1 and 7 days after transplantation. Grafts re-warmed rapidly during implantation. Function (left ventricular developed pressure, contractility, and relaxation) was significantly and persistently diminished in MUW-preserved grafts subjected to additional warming before transplantation. Preservation with ST was less effective than MUW despite being unaffected by warming. Preservation with MUW+Ca and rinsing with fresh MUW or ST before re-warming allowed recovery of function within 7 days despite significantly diminished function on day 1. This study demonstrated that an increase in the peri-transplant warm ischemic period was detrimental when hearts were preserved with MUW. Preservation with calcium-supplemented MUW or rinsing the heart with fresh MUW or ST before transplantation ameliorated this damage.

The mechanisms of tolerance were studied. Host-specific tolerance was established in PG490-88-treated BALB/c recipients. Significant numbers of host reactive Vbeta3+ T cells (3.56+/-1.66% among CD4, 4.06+/-1.62% among CD8, P<0.0001 vs. normal BALB/c mice, P>0.05 vs. normal B10.D2 mice) were present in PG490-88-treated mice, suggesting that clonal deletion was not responsible for the observed tolerance. Spleen cells from PG490-88-treated mice could not respond to the host antigens measured by a popliteal lymph node weight gain assay. The unresponsiveness was unable to be overcome by supplementation of exogenous interleukin (IL)-2. Tolerant Vbeta3+ T cells obtained from PG490-88-treated mice proliferated normally to nonantigen-specific T cell receptor cross-linking. Neither antigen-specific nor nonantigen-specific suppressor cells were found in PG490-88-treated mice. The tolerant mice produced IL-4 rather than IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma. Host-specific tolerance induced by PG490-88 in a murine bone marrow transplantation model is not due to deletion of alloreactive cells. Moreover, suppressor cells are not involved in the maintenance of tolerance. Rather, PG490-88 seems to lead to allogeneic tolerance either through the induction of a state of antigen-specific anergy of the responding T cells or through the induction of T-helper cell, type II (TH2) responses.

Prostacyclin can reduce PPHT to a level at which LiTx can be performed. In patients refractory to that treatment, combined (heart-)lung-LiTx is the only life-saving option. We report two cases of (heart-)lung-LiTx in patients with refractory severe PPHT. Patient 1, a 52-year-old female with viral cirrhosis and severe refractory PPHT, received a double-lung Tx followed by LiTx. After liver reperfusion, fatal heart failure occurred. Patient 2, a 42-year-old male with viral hepatitis and congenital liver fibrosis, also suffered from severe refractory PPHT. He successfully received an en bloc heart-lung Tx followed by LiTx. The rationale to replace the heart was an anticipated risk of intraoperative right heart failure after liver reperfusion and the technical ease of heart-lung versus double-lung Tx. Severe refractory PPHT is a fatal condition seen as a contraindication to LiTx. This condition can be treated by replacing thoracal organs in addition to the liver.

We evaluated serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a potential surveillance marker of acute cellular rejection. Blood samples (n=62) were analyzed from 23 patients and compared with controls (n=18) using an ELISA for VEGF. Results were correlated with endomyocardial biopsy rejection grades. Mean baseline VEGF levels of the transplant population were consistently higher than controls. Serum VEGF levels were significantly higher during acute cellular rejection when compared with the non-rejecting transplant group (700.7+/-154 pg/ml vs. 190.5+/-29 pg/ml). VEGF decreased two- to eightfold after immunosuppressive therapy in 9 of 11 rejection episodes.

The Norwegian health care system, like other health care systems in the world, is in the midst of a changing financial environment for hospital reimbursement for patient care. Since 1997 the Norwegian government has introduced a new financing model of block grant and activity-based financing. In this model, diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) play an important role in hospital financing. The initial motive for developing the DRGs was to improve hospital productivity and efficiency and to develop a tool to control increasing hospital costs better. We raised the question as to whether the DRG system in fact covers actual costs in patient groups undergoing heart transplantation (n = 12), lung transplantation (n = 4), and thoracotomy for other diseases (n = 10). A new prospective cost model was developed to measure actual costs related to individual patients. The patients were closely observed and the related data collected during the hospital stay. Each patient's hospital stay was divided into four different categories of resource requirements, defined as heavy intensive care, light intensive care, intermediate care, and ordinary care. In addition, the number of staff involved and the duration of surgery and procedures were recorded, as were medicine costs and material costs. Based on these data, the actual costs for each patient were calculated. These were then compared with the respective DRG reimbursement (100 % coverage) for the corresponding group. We found that the median cost for heart transplantation was US$ 50,590 (1 US$ = 7.5 NOK based on the exchange rate at the time of the study), while the respective DRG reimbursement was US$ 65,662. For lung transplantation, the respective figures were US$ 46,668 vs US$ 65,662, and for thoracotomy, US$ 24,307 vs. US$ 11,004. We found that our method was applicable to a hospital setting.

Biosensors play a critical role in the real-time determination of relevant functional physiological needs.

Host sensitization to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens is among the most critical of problems facing heart transplantation.

We investigated the significance of selectin-P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1)-mediated in vivo interactions in the immune cascade leading to rejection of cardiac allografts in skin presensitized rats. Infusion of a soluble recombinant form of PSGL-1 (rPSGL-Ig) during skin graft-mediated sensitization prevented Day 1.0 +/- 0.1 \"accelerated\" rejection in sensitized rat recipients, and prolonged cardiac allograft survival to Day 3.8 +/- 1.0 (p < 0.001). This therapy significantly depressed serum IgM levels and decreased intragraft expression of Th1 type cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-gamma) as well as of IL-1beta and MCP-1, as compared with controls, without affecting the initial number of infiltrating mononuclear cells (MNC). A profound decrease in graft-infiltrating MNC was recorded at 24 hours in rPSGL-Ig-treated rats. The expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an inducible heat shock protein 32 that protects against oxidative cell/tissue injury, was found in approximately 14-fold higher levels in the rPSGL-Ig-treated recipients as compared with controls. The HO-1 overexpression in rPSGL-Ig-treated hosts, primarily by infiltrating macrophages, was accompanied by virtual absence of myocardial infarcts and decreased frequency of TUNEL + cells at the graft site. Moreover, down-regulation of HO-1 expression by zinc protoporphyrin, an HO-1 antagonist, decreased expression of antiapoptotic Bag-1 molecule in recipients conditioned with rPSGL-Ig. Thus, the blockade of selectin-PSGL-1 interactions depresses intracardiac allograft expression of Th1 type cytokines, and might inhibit the differentiation of Th1 type cells. In addition, it up-regulates HO-1 expression and protects against myocardial infarction and apoptosis. Hence, this study reports on a previously unrecognized role of selectin-PSGL-1-mediated interactions after in vivo alloantigenic challenge.

Transforming growth factor beta I (TGF beta I) is a potent multifunctional cytokine with profibrogeneic effect. TGF beta I gene polymorphism correlates with cytokine production. In the present study, we looked for a predictor of renal insufficiency after HTx. In 175 HTx pts and 268 controls, polymorphism in the signal peptide of the TGF beta gene, substitution of leucine-proline at codon 10 and arginine-proline at codon 25, was evaluated by PCR. Renal function was followed after HTx and was compared with the TGF beta I genotypes. There were no differences in the frequencies of alleles and genotypes of TGF beta I gene in the healthy population and HTx recipients; TGF beta I genotype distribution in recipients with ischemic heart disease and dilated cardiomyopathy was almost identical. Renal function was decreasing in most HTx recipients with time. Progression of renal insufficiency (RI) was worse in patients with Leu at codon 10 (LeuLeu vs. LeuPro p < 0.01, LeuLeu vs. ProPro; p < 0.01). RI progression was also more pronounced in individuals homozygous at codon 25 (ArgArg vs. ArgPro; p < 0.01). In individuals heterozygous at codon 10 (LeuPro), the genotype at codon 25 determined the progression of RI (LeuPro/ArgArg vs. LeuPro/ArgPro; p < 0.05).

The plasma concentration of noradrenaline ([NA]) is higher than that of adrenaline ([A]) both in normal subjects and in heart transplant recipients (HTR). Since in both groups the myocardial density of beta1-adrenergenic receptors is much greater than that of beta2-adrenergenic receptors, the chronotropic response of a denervated heart to changes in plasma [NA] and [A] in the absence of reinnervation should be similar to that of agonist stimulation of beta1-receptors. To test this hypothesis, 17 HTR and 9 healthy subjects (CTL) performed incremental exercise on a cycle ergometer to voluntary exhaustion. Heart rate (HR) was recorded by electrocardiography. [NA] and [A] were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography at rest and at increasing workloads (w). In both groups, HR and [NA+A] increased with w, and HR with [NA+A]. Normalized HR values, plotted against the logarithm of [NA+A], fitted significantly logistic curves. The affinity constants were different, i.e. 2599+/-350 and 487+/-37 ng.l(-1), for HTR and CTL, respectively. The chronotropic effect of changes in [NA+A] in HTR was similar to that of combined beta1- and beta2-adrenergic activation evoked by applying isoprenaline to isolated heart myocytes (Brodde OE, Pharmacol Ther 60:405-430, 1993).

The dobutamine echocardiographic test (DET) is frequently used in coronary artery disease to detect viable myocardium, but few data are available about its role in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM). The aims of this study were to evaluate the clinical role of DET and the prognostic implications of the 'contractile reserve' in patients with IDCM treated with optimal medical therapy, including beta-blockade (BB). A total of 51 patients with IDCM underwent DET at diagnosis. A positive response to DET (DET+) was judged to be a significant increase (> or =10 points) in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with a peak value > or =40%, and a reversed restrictive left ventricular filling pattern (RFP) if present at baseline study. Improvement at follow-up was defined according to combined clinical and echo-Doppler criteria. In all, 22 patients (43%) were classified as DET+. DET+ patients were less symptomatic (P<0.001), with lower heart rate (P<0.01), less enlarged left and right ventricles (P<0.0001 and P<0.05), higher LVEF (P=0.0001), less frequent RFP (P=0.01), and lower pulmonary pressure (P<0.01).

Among clinical data, NYHA classes I-II (OR=0.25, P=0.07) and BB dosage (OR=0.97, P<0.005) were significantly associated with higher transplant-free survival at multivariate analysis. The addition of DET+ (OR=0.34, P<0.05) showed a moderate but significant improvement of sensitivity, but the predictive power of the model remained low (sensitivity, 0.67; specificity, 0.55). Absence of left bundle branch block (OR=0.27, P<0.01) and BB dosage (OR=1.03, P<0.005), but not DET+, were predictive of improvement. In patients with IDCM, DET response is associated with a more favourable outcome, since it suggests an earlier stage of the disease. However, in the light of our data, the incremental prognostic power of DET response compared to clinical evaluation at enrollment, despite being significant, seems to be of limited clinical value.

Cell adhesion molecules and their ligands are essential for regulating lymphocyte recirculation and leucocyte emigration into an inflamed or injured tissue. Vascular endothelial selectins as mediators of leucocyte rolling and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) have been found to be up-regulated on activated endothelium during acute allograft rejection. This study was designed to investigate whether ICAM-1 or selectin-ligand deficiency, or a combination of both, affected graft survival during acute cardiac allograft rejection. To this goal, we performed cardiac transplantation using mice deficient in genes for ICAM-1 or alpha(1,3)fucosyltransferase Fuc-TVII, representing a model for general absence of selectin-ligand expression, and a newly developed strain with a double mutation in Fuc-TVII and ICAM-1 alleles. Transplantation of a heart from ICAM-1 -/- or Fuc-TVII/ICAM-1 double-mutated mice into allogeneic recipients resulted in limited (2-2.5 days) but nevertheless significant prolongation of the graft survival (P<0.01 and P<0.01 in log-rank test) compared with the survival of unmodified hearts. When ICAM-1 -/- hearts were transplanted into Fuc-TVII -/- recipients, the median survival time was prolonged by 8 days (P<0.01). These data indicate that endothelial ICAM-1 is involved in adhesion events during acute cardiac allograft rejection but reveal that the loss of one type, selectin/leucocyte ligand or selectin/endothelial ligand interaction, does not markedly affect graft survival, thereby suggesting a role for other compensatory adhesion molecule/ligand interactions.

In a model of cardiac transplantation investigating immunosuppression by inhibition of CD40 ligand costimulation, we have applied a combination of cluster algorithms and self-organizing maps to analyze a panel of 60 candidate genes. Dendrograms generated by cluster analysis distinguished different molecular bases of rejection. Using self-organizing maps, we identified nine genes (CD4, CCR3, CCR5, LT beta, MIP-1 alpha, MIP-2, CD8 alpha, IP-10, and RANTES), each with a unique profile of transcriptional expression, that reproduce the differentiation of states of rejection in dendrograms. Using histology and immunohistochemistry, we correlated differential regulation of CD4 and CD8 at the levels of mRNA and protein.

Recurrent and de novo neoplasms are ominous risk factors for transplant patients. In particular, when organ transplantation is attempted to cure isolated cancers, conventional immunosuppression likely promotes cancer reestablishment. Therefore, drugs with both immunosuppressive and antineoplastic activity are needed. We show that the anticancer agent paclitaxel may fulfill these diverse expectations. Heterotopic heart transplantation was performed in the ACI-to-Lewis or Lewis-to-ACI rat-strain combination and paclitaxel was injected i.p. daily (days 0-14) at doses from 0.75-1.5 mg/kg. Serum cytotoxic antidonor antibody levels were measured using a complement-mediated cell cytotoxicity assay. In vitro, the effect of paclitaxel on Lewis lymphocyte viability and apoptosis was determined. Also, Lewis lymphocytes preconditioned with irradiated ACI cells+/-paclitaxel, were restimulated with ACI cells and tested for cytotoxic T cell (CTL) activity and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. Paclitaxel promoted heart allograft survival in a dose-dependent manner in both high- and low-responder transplant combinations. Furthermore, low-doses of paclitaxel (0.75-1.0 mg/kg) and cyclosporine (1 mg/kg) in combination synergistically increased transplant survival. Immunologically, paclitaxel markedly reduced the antidonor cytotoxic antibody response. In vitro, nearly 90% of prestimulated lymphocytes were killed by paclitaxel and cells became positive for the apoptosis marker, annexin-V. Furthermore, paclitaxel reduced CTL activity and IL-2 production after alloantigen rechallenge. Paclitaxel, a clinically proven antineoplastic agent, also has potent immunosuppressive properties in rodent organ transplantation.

We report on the cytoprotective effects of HO-1 in a rat cardiac I/R injury model, using cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) as HO-1 inducer and zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) as HO-1 inhibitor. Three groups of Lewis rats were studied: group 1 control donors received phosphate-buffered saline 48 hr before the harvest; group 2 donors were pretreated with CoPP at -48 hr; and in group 3, donors received CoPP at -48 hr and ZnPP was given to recipients at reperfusion. Hearts were harvested, stored in University of Wisconsin solution (4 degrees C) for 24 hr, and then transplanted to syngeneic (Lewis) rats. Sixty percent of control grafts ceased their function in <15 min. In contrast, 80% of CoPP-pretreated grafts survived 14 days. All grafts stopped functioning within 24 hr after CoPP + ZnPP therapy. Cardiac HO-1 enzymatic activity and protein expression correlated with beneficial effects of CoPP and deleterious effects of adjunctive ZnPP treatment. Markedly less apoptotic (TUNEL+) myocyte/endothelial cells could be detected in CoPP cardiac grafts, as compared with controls. The expression of antiapoptotic (Bcl-2/Bag-1) proteins was up-regulated in the CoPP group. HO-1 overexpression provides potent protection against cold I/R injury in a stringent rat cardiac model. This effect depends, at least in part, on HO-1-mediated up-regulation of a host antiapoptotic mechanism, especially in the early postreperfusion period.

Maneuvers that interfere with signals 1, 2, 3, or Ag processing can result in indefinite allograft survival.

We hypothesized that secondary lymphoid organs are important for interactions among lymphocytes, alloantigen, and immunosuppressants that lead to tolerance. To explore this, cardiac allografts were performed with a tolerogenic immunosuppressive regimen. Concurrent administration of anti-L-selectin (CD62L) Ab, which prevents lymph node homing, prevents indefinite allograft survival and tolerance. Anti-CD62L Ab is not costimulatory, and Fab and F(ab')(2) anti-CD62L have similar activities. Flow cytometry and histologic examination show that Ab shifts T cells away from lymph nodes and into spleen, peripheral blood, and graft. Tolerance is not induced in CD62L(-/-) mice, and adoptive transfer of CD62L(-/-), but not CD62L(+/+), T cells prevents tolerization in wild-type recipients. FTY720, an immunosuppressant that promotes chemokine-dependent, but CD62L-independent, lymph node homing, reverses the Ab effect. Blockade of other homing receptors also prevents tolerization.

Previous work on blockade of CD40-CD40 ligand interaction in mice and primates with anti-CD40 ligand mAbs has resulted in a moderate prolongation of allograft survival without the development of true allograft tolerance. In this study, we show in rats that adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of CD40Ig sequences into the graft resulted in prolonged (>200 days) expression of CD40Ig and in long-term (>300 days) survival. Recipients expressing CD40Ig displayed strongly (>90%) inhibited mixed leukocyte reactions and alloantibody production at early (days 5 and 17) and late time points (>100 day) after transplantation, but showed limited inhibition of leukocyte infiltration and cytokine production as evaluated by immunohistology at early time points (day 5). Recipients of long-surviving hearts showed donor-specific hyporesponsiveness since acceptance of second cardiac allografts was donor specific. Nevertheless, long-term allografts (>100 days) displayed signs of chronic rejection vasculopathy. Occluded vessels showed leukocyte infiltration, mainly composed of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells, macrophages, and mast cells. These recipients also showed antidonor CTL activity. Recipients expressing CD40Ig did not show nonspecific immunosuppression, as they were able to mount anticognate immune responses that were partially inhibited at early time points and were normal thereafter. We conclude that gene transfer-mediated expression of CD40Ig resulted in a highly efficient inhibition of acute heart allograft rejection in rats. This treatment induced donor-specific inhibition of certain alloreactive mechanisms in the short-, but not the long-term, which resulted in long-term survival of allografts concomitant with the development of chronic rejection.

To test the hypothesis that the functional phenotype of cardiac microvascular endothelial cells is maintained partly by a cardiac myocyte platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B-induced paracrine pathway, we conducted in vitro studies with murine cardiac cells. These studies demonstrated that unlike young endothelial cells, endothelial cells of the aging heart do not express PDGF-B when cultured in the presence of cardiac myocytes.

Each year over 50,000 persons in the United States could potentially benefit from some form of permanent cardiac replacement or assistance. Approximately 7000 of these persons get on the waiting list for a transplant, and 2300 are transplanted. About 2000 patients are reportedly exposed to a mechanical cardiac assist device, most often as a bridge to transplant. The majority of persons who might benefit from cardiac replacement are never referred for treatment and, thus, the number of deaths on the waiting list is a misleading indicator of access to transplantation and overall patient mortality. The total economic burden associated with coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure now exceeds $140 billion each year, with approximately $700 million directly spent on heart transplant procedures alone. If a viable total artificial heart is devised to replace a failed heart, or a ventricular assist system to permanently assist a failing heart, direct aggregate expenditures alone are likely to be somewhere between $5.4 and $24.0 billion annually. Based on individual patient care costs, as well as aggregate national expenditures, insurers will be reluctant to pay for the permanent use of such devices, even though cost is reportedly not a consideration in coverage decisions. Today, medical benefits and added value are concepts that will shape the coverage determination process, as will increasingly liberal policies regarding payment for treatment costs in relationship to clinical trials.

Data from 185 patients were retrospectively evaluated for adverse events, duration of exposure (person-days), and the mean atorvastatin dose exposure. Changes in lipid parameters, and prednisone and cyclosporine doses were determined. 48 patients received atorvastatin for 24,240 person-days at a mean dose exposure of 21 +/- 10 mg.

The incidence of cardiac allograft vasculopathy increases with time after heart transplantation. Allograft vasculopathy is associated with endothelial dysfunction and reduced endothelium-dependent nitric oxide-mediated vascular effects. In this study, temporal changes in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) expression in human myocardial biopsies were investigated during the first 3 years after heart transplantation. In each patient (n = 7), the immunohistochemical presence of NOS3 and inducible nitric oxide synthase were examined in serial biopsies taken at 1, 4, and 26 weeks and at 1, 2, and 3 years after transplantation. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase was present in vascular endothelial cells in all biopsies at the time of transplantation. A rapid fall within the first months in the number of NOS3-positive biopsies was observed, with a possible difference in the rate of disappearance among the capillaries, the arterial endothelium, and the venous endothelium. After 2 years, very little NOS3 could be detected. Inducible nitric oxide synthase was present in vascular smooth muscle cells throughout the study period and did not change. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity is gradually lost after heart transplantation. These changes may be responsible for the coronary endothelial dysfunction often seen after human cardiac transplantation.

Complex congenital cardiac anomalies involving ventricular hypoplasia require either staged palliative reconstruction, converting the circulatory system to a single ventricle based pump, or allogeneic transplantation. Tissue engineering offers the potential for complete reconstruction of these defects, but is limited by the inability to model myocardial tissue engineering in a small animal. Our goal was to develop a small animal model for ventricular tissue engineering using rat heterotopic heart transplantation. Donor hearts were explanted after cardioplegic arrest and the left ventricular volume was augmented by the implantation of a biodegradable engineered construct. The heart was then transplanted heterotopically into syngeneic recipients creating either a volume loaded, functioning left ventricle, or a non-functioning left ventricle. Some of the engineered constructs were seeded with multipotent bone marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells before implantation. Animals were evaluated by echocardiography, morphology, histology, and immunohistochemistry after 1 month. A scaffolding constructed from polytetrafluoroethylene, polylactide mesh, and type I and IV collagen hydrogel resulted in minimal intracardiac inflammation without aneurysmal dilatation. Successful transplantation and differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells was accomplished using this scaffolding. No ventricular arrhythmias resulted from this surgical manipulation and echocardiography revealed both end systolic and diastolic volume augmentation with ventricular expansion. We have developed an in vivo model of ventricular tissue engineering using heterotopic heart transplantation. Future work will focus on construction of ventricular tissue around pre-fabricated vascular networks in order increase cellular engraftment for ventricular reconstruction.

Oxidative stress after ischemia-reperfusion of cardiac allografts leads to activation of cardiomyocytes and production of cytokines. Bcl-2, an inhibitor of the apoptotic pathway, also has strong antioxidant properties. Ischemia-reperfusion injury after transplantation leads to decreased bcl-2 and increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 is known to attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury and inhibits apoptosis of myofibroblasts. We hypothesize that TGF-beta1, prevents bcl-2 cleavage and increased TNF-alpha production. Rat PVG donor hearts were heterotopically transplanted into ACI recipients. Donor hearts were procured and assigned to groups: (1) intracoronary TGF-beta1 (200 ng/ml) perfusion and pressure at 78 psi for 45 minutes (n = 4); (2) intracoronary TGF-beta1 perfusion and incubation for 45 minutes without pressure (n = 4), (3) saline perfusion and incubation for 45 minutes without pressure (n = 4). Hearts were procured 4 hours after transplantation and analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for bcl-2 mRNA expression, ELISA for TNF-alpha, and for myeloperoxidase activity (MPO). Bcl-2 decreased in untreated animals (bcl-2:G3PDH ratio = 0.85 +/- 0.73 vs 1.16 +/- 0.11, not significant [NS]), whereas TNF-alpha increased to 669.99 +/- 127.09 vs 276.84 +/- 73.65 pg/mg total protein in controls (p < 0.003). In TGF-beta(1) pressure-treated hearts, bcl-2 was up-regulated (2.49 +/- 0.6 vs 1.16 +/- 0.11, controls, p < 0.005), whereas TNF-alpha was unchanged (396.1 +/- 100.38 vs 276.84 +/- 73.65 pg/mg, NS). Hearts treated with TGF-beta1 and pressure showed significant up-regulation of bcl-2 compared with hearts treated with TGF-beta1 without pressure (2.49 +/- 0.6 vs 1.17 +/- 0.6, p < 0.02). MPO showed no differences. Bcl-2 is down-regulated and TNF-alpha up-regulated in this model of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Furthermore, TGF-beta1 is linked to this process and ameliorates reperfusion injury by up-regulating bcl-2 and inhibiting TNF-alpha.

The use of lung grafts from non-heart-beat donors (NHBDs) is one way of solving the critical donor organ shortage. Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) and gabexate mesilate (FOY), a protease inhibitor, can attenuate some types of neutrophil-mediated tissue injury. Using an isolated lung ventilation and perfusion model, we studied the effects of these agents on reperfusion injury following lung transplantation from NHBDs. Five groups of minipigs were studied. In group 1(n = 6), the lungs were flushed and harvested after cardiac arrest, and were reperfused for 2 hours after 2 hours of cold ischemia. In group 2 (n = 6), the lungs were harvested after 2 hours of in situ warm ischemia, followed by 2 hours of cold ischemia and 2 hours of reperfusion. In groups 3 (n = 7), 4 (n = 7), and 5 (n = 6), the procedure was the same as in group 2, except in group 3, NO was inhaled before and after ischemia, in group 4, FOY was given intravenously, and in group 5, a combination of inhaled NO and intravenous FOY were administered. Compared with group 1, group 2 had higher mean pulmonary arterial pressure, vascular resistance, and lower arterial blood oxygen tension. Furthermore, these negative effects of warm ischemia were also reflected in the contents of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, histology, and permeability change. Either FOY or NO administration (groups 3 or 4) ameliorated the associated injury. A combination of FOY and NO use (group5) decreased the parameters of lung reperfusion injury measurement to a larger degree than either agent individually. The inhaled NO and FOY can protect NHBD lung grafts at an early reperfusion period. Their use in combination has an additive protective effect that might be applied to the protection of NHBD grafts from preservation and reperfusion injury.

Largely initiated by studies among Greenland Eskimos in the early 1970s, great attention has been given to the possible effects of the very long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in a variety of cardiovascular disease states. A series of possibly positive effects on pathogenetic mechanisms in cardiovascular disease has evolved from laboratory studies in cell cultures and animals as well as in humans, focusing mainly on eicosanoid metabolism with reduced activities of platelets and leucocytes, reduced plasma triglycerides and, antiarrhythmic effects in the myocardium. A rationale for a positive effect of very long chain n-3 PUFA in the secondary prophylaxis after revascularization procedures obviously also exists. The positive clinical effects based on prospectively randomized trials are summarized as follows. After coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), the SHOT study showed statistically significant reduction in angiographic vein graft occlusion in 610 patients after 1 yr with supplementation of 3.4 g/d of highly concentrated very long chain n-3 PUFA. The reduction in occlusion rates was significantly related to the change in the n-3 PUFA concentration in serum phospholipids during the study period with the occlusion rate in the upper quartile of such changes at only approximately 50% of that in the lower quartile. These results were also clearly related to the presence of angina pectoris and occurrence of myocardial infarction after 1 yr. Several studies were conducted in patients after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). By 1993, two meta-analyses indicated a positive effect on the restenosis rate, a significant problem after otherwise successful PTCA. During the late 1990s, three large prospective randomized placebo-controlled angiographic studies were conducted with very long n-3 PUFA 5.1-8.0 g/d, all with completely negative results. Today, therefore, very long chain n-3 PUFA supplementation cannot be recommended to reduce the incidence of restenosis after PTCA. All studies were performed without stenting of the coronary lesion. In the very special revascularization procedure of heart transplantation, evolving hypertension and accelerated atherosclerosis have been major clinical problems. In other studies, positive effects by supplementation with very long chain n-3 PUFA (3.4-5.7 g/d) were obtained on the surrogate end points coronary vasoreactivity to acetylcholine and hypertension, respectively. On the basis of the presently available literature from clinical studies, recommendations for supplementation with very long chain n-3 PUFA can be given to patients after venous CABG (up to 3.4 g/d), and after heart transplantation (3.4-5.7 g/d) but not to patients after traditional PTCA. In fact, data from substudies suggested the possibility that large doses (5.1 g/d) of very long chain n-3 PUFA might be contraindicated because they induce a proinflammatory state in patients under oxidative stress.

In the year 1902, the first successful experimental organ transplant, i.e., an autotransplant of a dog's kidney from its normal position to the vessels of the neck, which resulted in some urine flow, was performed in the Vienna Physiology Institute under the direction of Hofrath Exner by Dr. Emerich Ullman (1861-1937). Since then, the art of transplant surgery has come a long way in establishing itself as an important discipline with the support disciplines of immunology, molecular biology, etc., for the restoration of a failing organ. Today there is a major discrepancy in the demand and supply of organ grafts. The aim of the present study is to see whether fetal organ and tissue, with its intrinsic advantages of hypo-antigenicity, can survive in a HLA and sex-randomized host in a surgically prepared vascular subcutaneous axillary fold, without any immunosuppressive support. We have earlier reported two cases of fetal thymic transplant, collected from consenting mothers undergoing hysterotomy and ligation. Fourteen cases were recruited for the present study after thorough informed consent and approval by the Ethical Committee of the Project. Of these, five patients were suffering from advanced cancer, three from diabetic gangrene, three from ischaemic heart disease and three from rheumatoid arthritis, liver abscess and disc prolapse. The ages of the patients varied from 39 to 82 years. Six fetal thymuses, three fetal liver tissues, three fetal cardiac tissues, one fetal pancreas and one fetal lung tissue were transplanted. All the fetuses were dissected and the selected tissues/organs were transplanted within one to three minutes after collecting them from the consenting mothers undergoing hysterotomy and ligation. The fetal tissue graft was placed in a surgically prepared subcutaneous vascular axillary fold, 2x1 cm, under local anaesthesia in the consenting adult recipient. Sequential Hb, Tc, Dc, ESR were done to see the impact of the transplant on the host system. After one month, the transplanted fetal tissue was taken out by an elliptical incision and the tissue was processed for histological staining. All the 14 patients tolerated the transplant procedure well. There was no fever, intractable pain or any other specific serious side-effect justifying removal of the transplant earlier. There was no discharge from the incision site and the healing and scar were by and large normal. There was no unusual leucocytosis or lymphocytosis. The serial histological study did not suggest features of transplant rejection. Pregnancy and neoplasm are two outstanding examples of natural tolerance to homograft. In both cases, blocking antibody has an important role in the phenomenon of immunotolerance.

Previous studies have suggested an independent role of ET-1 and PDGF in the development of cardiac allograft arteriosclerosis (i.e., chronic rejection).

Acute rejection induced both ET-1 receptors in the arterial wall. On linear regression analysis of chronically rejecting cardiac allografts, a strong correlation between intimal thickening and immunoreactivity of ET-1 and ET receptors A and B (ET(A) and ET(B)) in the arterial walls was observed. Treatment with Bosentan, a mixed ET-1 receptor antagonist, significantly reduced the incidence and intensity of arteriosclerotic lesions in rat cardiac allografts, as well as total intragraft ET(A) and ET(B) mRNA expression and intimal cell ET-1 and receptor immunoreactivity.

Transplantation of neonatal cardiomyocytes is a novel approach for the treatment of heart failure and myocardial infarction, but quantitative information on long-term cell survival and development is limited. Male donor cardiomyocytes were isolated from neonatal Fischer 344 rats (1-2 days), purified, and injected into the left ventricular wall of female syngeneic adult rats. One hour to 12 weeks later, genomic DNA was isolated from recipient hearts. The amount of male DNA per sample was determined by quantitative real-time TaqMan PCR of the male-specific Sry gene. Transplanted cell survival was 57 +/- 9% at 0-1 h, 24 +/- 6% at 24 h, 28 +/- 11% at 7 days, 27 +/- 3% at 14 days, 23 +/- 8% at 4 weeks and 15 +/- 3% at 12 weeks. The caspase inhibitor AcYVADcmk failed to improve transplanted cell survival at 24 h, suggesting that apoptosis did not play a major role in cell loss. Histology revealed that transplanted cells became more elongated over time, developed cross-striations, and that their nuclei increased in size. However, at 12 weeks, transplanted cells and their nuclei were still smaller than those of host myocardium. We established a quantitative survival profile for neonatal cardiomyocytes transplanted into normal adult myocardium. There was significant loss of cells within 24 h, but 15% of transplanted cells survived 12 weeks. Those cells that did survive underwent differentiation and developed visible sarcomeres, suggesting a potential contribution toward ventricular function.

One concern focuses on whether chronological or functional age is the better predictor of positive outcomes when considering heart transplantation for an elderly patient with end-stage heart disease. Another concern is related to the philosophical and ethical rationale for allocation of scarce resources to those near the end of a normal life expectancy. However, the number of people who are older than age 65 years and have received a donor heart has increased and will continue to due to aging of the people who received a transplant a decade ago, as well as the growing number of people who undergo heart transplantation after the age of 65.

In this phenomenological study, in-depth interviews were used to obtain a description of spouses' experiences in heart transplantation. Thematic analysis of the transcripts revealed four major, interrelated themes: death-life, vigilance, change, and gift. The experience was contextualized by the existential grounds of time and other people. Findings suggested that the changes inherent in the transplant experience have not been fully described in previous studies. The theme of death-life was dominant and pervasive in all interviews. As the threat of their husbands' deaths became less prominent, wives reported difficulty letting go of their vigilance. Although the most outstanding gift was that of the donor organ, spouses also gratefully remembered the donor and donor family. Time was not perceived as a boundary separating periods of the transplant experience; all aspects of time seemed to be woven seamlessly from the past through the present and into the future.

We investigated the delivery of a donor-specific MHC class I gene, H-2K(b), using a newly constructed replication-defective recombinant adenovirus (AdSV40K(b)) to recipient tissue before transplantation as a means of inducing donor-specific immunological unresponsiveness. AdSV40K(b) was able to transduce both a fibroblast cell line and freshly isolated bone marrow cells (BMCs) resulting in cell surface expression of H2-K(b) protein. Intravenous infusion of AdSV40K(b)-transduced syngeneic CBA/Ca (H-2(k)) BMCs into CBA recipient mice treated with an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody 27 days before transplantation of a fully MHC-mismatched, C57BL/10 (H-2K(b+)), cardiac allograft resulted in significant long-term graft survival when compared with mice receiving the same dose of syngeneic BMCs transduced with a control adenovirus, AdRSVbetagal. Despite the induction of H-2K(b)-specific hyporesponsiveness following pretreatment with AdSV40K(b)-transduced CBA BMCs, persistence of H-2K(b) mRNA in central or peripheral tissues could not be demonstrated by RT-PCR. This result was in contrast to the observed persistence of K(b) mRNA both in the periphery and thymus following the infusion of transgenic CBK (H-2(k) + K(b)) BMCs. We conclude that ex vivo adenoviral gene transfer of a single donor MHC class I gene to recipient BMCs in combination with transient depletion of CD4(+) cells is sufficient to induce long-term graft survival of a fully allogeneic cardiac graft. In addition, detectable microchimerism is not a prerequisite for graft survival.

It is well established that consumption of a meal releases a gradually developing and quite marked increase in blood flow to the gastrointestinal organs and a similar and simultaneous increase in cardiac output (CO). It is not known through which mechanism the pumping of the heart adjusts so accurately to the gastrointestinal flow increase. We have approached this problem by serving a standardized, mixed meal to five patients with recently transplanted and thus denervated hearts and to five sex- and age-matched controls. Pre- and postprandial levels of CO and blood flow in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) were recorded with Doppler ultrasound technique. The patients with transplanted hearts had significantly higher preprandial levels of heart rate (HR) and CO than the controls. With a timing similar to that seen in the controls did all five patients develop considerable and synchronous postprandial increases in superior mesenteric arterial flow and in CO. Increases in superior mesenteric arterial flow were significantly greater than the controls. Also, COs, high even before meals were given, increased further and to the same relative extent as in the control persons. The marked postprandial increase in CO, probably secondary to the increase in intestinal blood flow, could hardly come about through any sort of nervous reflex to the recently transplanted and denervated hearts. It appears more likely that a humoral connection of some sort exists between the two circulatory events.

Nitric oxide (NO) derived from the up-regulation of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) is believed to play an important role in organ rejection. In experimental models of acute cardiac transplant rejection (i.e., without immunosuppression), treatment using NOS inhibitors to prevent acute rejection have yielded conflicting results. This is most likely due to potential inhibition of constitutive NOS. Accordingly, agents that trap NO directly may have some advantage. In the current study, we evaluated the actions of a ruthenium-based NO scavenger, AMD6221, to inhibit the nitrosylation of myocardial protein and to prolong cardiac allograft survival in a model of acute cardiac transplant rejection (without immunosuppression). In addition, we evaluated the efficacy of AMD6221 used in combination with low-dose cyclosporine (CsA) (i.e., a model of delayed graft rejection). Heterotopic abdominal cardiac transplantation was performed using rat strains with disparities at major and minor histocompatibility loci. Grafts were harvested on postoperative day 6 for histologic examination or analysis of myocardial protein nitrosylation using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Other animals were monitored twice daily to determine rejection times. Plasma was also taken at postoperative day 6 for determining the concentration of NO by-products (nitrate plus nitrite). Treatment with AMD6221 either prolonged graft survival and/or caused a marked decrease in myocardial nitrosylprotein formation as determined by EPR spectroscopy. In vivo scavenging of NO by AMD6221 was verified by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of nitrosylated-drug in plasma samples. Low-dose CsA given alone or in combination with AMD6221 completely blocked formation of myocardial nitrosylprotein complexes. Whereas low-dose CsA alone prolonged graft survival, combination therapy with CsA plus AMD6221 produced a synergistic effect on graft survival. These studies indicate that treatment with a ruthenium-based NO scavenger, such as AMD6221, may be an effective regimen used alone or in combination with CsA to protect myocardial proteins from posttranscriptional modification and to prolong cardiac graft survival.

To test the stationary heart rate we performed a scanning of Holter in qualified strips of four beats in which the three consecutive intervals demonstrate a constant acceleration or deceleration sequential variations of tachographic values. The results obtained demonstrated that in normal and transplanted subjects stationary and non stationary strips are evident. Both in normal and in transplanted subjects non-stationary strips are prevalent, although in different ways: in normal subjects the stationary and non-stationary ratio is 1:1.40; in transplanted subjects the ratio is 1:1.68. Non-stationary strips, that in the cartesian plane do not demonstrate any directional variation, in normal subjects are, on average, higher than in transplanted subjects. The same phenomenon is available for the strips with only one variation. The strips with three consecutive variations are much more evident (more 50%) in transplanted subjects. These strips are also more numerous compared to the sum of all the other strips with a single variation.

This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that transplant coronary vasculopathy (CV) is associated with increased myocardial protein expression of both tissue factor (TF) and integrin alphavbeta3. The vitronectin receptor (integrin alphavbeta3) and TF have recently been found to play a key role in apoptotic cell death and vascular endothelial cell injury. A total of 77 heart transplant recipients underwent simultaneous endomyocardial biopsy and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) at one year of transplant. Patients with pre-existing donor coronary atherosclerosis (n = 35) or with acute rejection (grade >1A, n = 10) at the time of the IVUS were excluded from the analysis. The remaining 32 patients constitute the cohort of the present study. A computerized biopsy score was derived based on the duration and severity of cellular rejection. Both TF and alphavbeta3 expression in the heart biopsy specimens were evaluated by immunoperoxidase histochemistry and Western blot analysis. Patients with CV (n = 24) had increased expression of alphavbeta3 (2.7-fold, p = 0.003) and TF (7.9-fold, p = 0.04) compared with patients without evidence of vasculopathy (n = 8). In the absence of myocardial fibrosis, alphavbeta3 expression correlated significantly with the cellular rejection score (r = 0.58, p = 0.02).

The non-depleting anti-CD4 mAb RIB5/2 is a powerful inducer of tolerance to MHC-incompatible renal and heart allografts in rat recipients. In vitro the mAb blocks the proliferation and cytokine production of alloreactive T cells. To learn more about the mechanism of anti-CD4-mediated suppression, we applied differential display reverse transcription-PCR to identify differences at mRNA level between T cells stimulated by alloantigen in the presence or absence of anti-CD4 mAb. A sequence alignment of a 550-bp DNA fragment appearing only in anti-CD4 mAb-treated cells resulted in at least 95% homology to a mouse cDNA encoding for the anti-apoptotic protein Bag-1. Further investigation of Bag-1 expression during mixed lymphocyte reactions revealed a three- to fourfold up-regulation of Bag-1 mRNA expression in anti-CD4 mAb-treated allogeneic cultures which was confirmed at protein level. Bag-1 up-regulation was associated with an increase resistance to apoptosis of T cells from anti-CD4 mAb-treated cultures. Application of antisense oligonucleotides specific for Bag-1 reduced Bag-1 protein expression and restored susceptibility to apoptosis. In addition, up-regulation of Bag-1 mRNA could also be detected in graft-infiltrating T cells from anti-CD4 mAb-treated rats in vivo. Thus, the expression of Bag-1 in a subset of anti-CD4 mAb-treated alloreactive T cells conferred resistance against apoptosis, potentially contributing to the long-term survival of these cells.

The most common measurements of pulmonary hypertension include systolic and mean pulmonary artery pressures, PVR, and transpulmonary gradient. Pulmonary artery pressures greater than 50 mm Hg, PVR greater than 6 Woods units, and transpulmonary gradient greater than 15 mm Hg that are unresponsive to optimal vasodilators are contraindications to orthotopic heart transplantation. Therapies used to reduce PVR in the cardiac catheterization laboratory include high-flow oxygen; sublingual nitroglycerin; and intravenous inotropic agents, vasodilators, and selective pulmonary vasodilators. Systemic hypotension may be an undesirable side effect of vasodilators. Inhaled agents such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin are specific to the pulmonary vasculature and reduce PVR without causing systemic hypotension. All pharmacological therapies used to optimize pulmonary hemodynamics before transplantation can be used during transplantation in patients who are at high risk for acute right ventricular failure and death after orthotopic heart transplantation because of elevated pulmonary hemodynamic values. Use of larger donor hearts for patients with elevated PVR and referral for heart-lung transplantation are potential treatment options. A heterotopic heart transplantation might also be attempted. However, because of the poor success with heterotopic transplantation, other options such as treatment with inhaled pulmonary vasodilators show much more promise and are associated with long-term survival after transplantation.

Transplantation tolerance is a dynamic state that involves several homeostatic mechanisms intrinsic to the host. One of these mechanisms is activation-induced T cell death (AICD). However, it is unclear where AICD takes place during alloreactive responses. Since activated T cells can re-enter the thymus, we hypothesized that mature T cells activated by an allograft could be deleted upon re-entry into the thymus. To test this hypothesis, we used wild-type or 2C TCR transgenic mice receiving syngeneic or allogeneic heterotopic, vascularized heart grafts. First, we demonstrated that ex vivo CFSE-labelled T cells re-entered the thymus when transferred into allograft recipients but not when transferred into isograft recipients. Next, we compared the changes in cell subset numbers and incidence of apoptosis in the thymi and spleens of allograft or isograft recipients. Seven days after transplantation, at a time in which all the allografts were undergoing rejection, cells expressing donor-MHC class II molecules had migrated to the thymus and to the spleen. In the thymus of allograft recipients, overall cellularity was significantly reduced by 40% and associated with an increase in the number of double negative (CD4-CD8-) thymocytes and a decrease in double positive (CD4+CD8+) thymocytes, consistent with increased negative selection of thymocytes. Additionally, thymi of allograft recipients showed an increase in the number of recently activated, mature T cells (TCRhi, CD25+, CD44+) and a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells, especially in the thymic medulla, that involved mature T cells as indicated by the TCRhi, CD44+, CD4 or CD8 single positive phenotype. Spleens of allograft recipients were increased in size and cellularity but did not show any of the changes in cell subsets seen in the thymi. Our data show that after allografting there is an increase in apoptotic cell death that is associated with negative selection of developing thymocytes as well as of alloreactive mature T cells that have re-entered the thymus upon activation in the periphery.

To overcome this problem, many programs have begun to use marginal or extended donors after reports suggesting equivalent outcomes with no additional risk. As our use of extended donor lungs increased and our recipient selection criteria expanded, we believed it was appropriate to reevaluate outcomes with extended donor lungs compared with outcomes with standard donor lungs and recipients outside of the currently accepted guidelines. We performed a retrospective review of 128 consecutive lung or heart-lung transplants from January 1, 1997, to June 30, 2000. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. Donors were considered extended if any one of the following criteria were met: age greater than 55 years, smoking longer than 20 pack-years, presence of chest radiographic film infiltrate, PO (2) of less than 300 mm Hg, or purulent secretions on bronchoscopy. Guideline and nonguideline recipients were defined on the basis of previously published criteria. Of a total of 123 donors, 63 (51%) were extended. Forty-eight donors failed 1 criterion, 10 failed 2 criteria, and 5 failed 3 criteria. One hundred twenty-eight transplants were performed. The 30-day mortality for the standard donor group was 4 (6.2%) of 65 versus 11 (17.5%) of 63 for the extended donor group (P =.047). Although many extended donor lungs will result in acceptable postoperative function, caution needs to be exercised in the uses of certain extended donor lungs because there seems to be an increased early mortality rate in that group of recipients. Nonguideline recipients appear to have acceptable early mortality, except when they received extended donor lungs. ", "label": 0}{"text": "The pig as a source of cardiac xenografts. The inadequate availability of human donor hearts and other organs has inspired interest in the field of xenotransplantation. Historically, ten attempts to transplant animal hearts into human recipients have been reported. Those who received hearts from nonhuman primates (i.e., baboons and chimpanzees) survived rather longer than did those who received hearts from nonprimates (i.e., sheep and pigs). Nevertheless, current opinion is that the pig is the best candidate as a source of hearts for humans despite the considerable immunologic disparity between the two species. Pigs are available in large numbers and can be bred easily and rapidly. They grow to appropriate sizes and their cardiovascular system is similar to that of humans. Substantial knowledge has been accumulated regarding both genetic engineering and tolerance induction in pigs, two strategies that may help to overcome the existing immunologic barriers. Concern has been raised, however, with regard to the potential for the transfer of a porcine infection with the pig organ to the human recipient.

In such patients, heart transplantation is the treatment of choice. The number of patients awaiting transplantation is several-fold higher than the number of procedures performed. Heart transplantation therapy has numerous limitations and is associated with serious complications. The left ventricular assist device is a step towards this goal. It can be attached to the weakened left ventricle to temporarily increase blood flow to the body. The use of left ventricular assist devices helps the failing heart to recover and extends the duration over which a patient's heart can wait for a replacement donor heart. This therapy is in use for only up to a few months.

Recently, a successful implantation of the AbioCor (Abiomed), the first fully implantable replacement heart, was accomplished. The AbioCor's internal battery system eliminates the need for the patient to be permanently immobilized through tubes or wires connected to an external power source. Innovative transcutaneous energy transmission permits the recharging of internal batteries.

Mongrel dogs were divided into 3 groups according to the warm ischemia time and the method of reperfusion before starting the autoperfusing heart-lung circuit. Group A (n=4) had 60 minutes of warm ischemia and reperfusion without leukocyte-depleted hot shot, Group B (n=5) had 30 minutes of warm ischemia and reperfusion with leukocyte-depleted hot shot, and Group C (n=7) had 60 minutes of warm ischemia and reperfusion with leukocyte-depleted hot shot. We calculated stroke work via the heart-lung circuit to evaluate cardiac function of the resuscitated hearts. The criteria for \"recovery\" has been reported elsewhere. Myocardial water content of the resuscitated hearts was also measured and analyzed. No inotropic agents were used. The recovery rates in groups A, B and C were 0%, 80% and 57%, respectively, and the group B rate was significantly higher than the group A rate (p=0.04). Although myocardial water content did not differ between groups B and C, it was significantly lower in recovered hearts than in non-recovered hearts (p=0.04). Significant negative correlation was observed between the maximum stroke work value and myocardial water content in the resuscitated hearts (r=0.668, p=0.03). The autoperfusing heart-lung circuit is useful for evaluation and maintenance of cardiac function.

The proportion of cardiac transplant recipients with preexisting sensitization to HLA alloantigens has been increasing. Sensitization prolongs duration to obtaining a donor and predicts poorer long-term allograft survival because of increased risk of cellular rejections. We investigated the effect of cyclophosphamide pulse therapy in sensitized cardiac allograft recipients. Pretransplant and posttransplant outcomes were compared between 88 cardiac allograft recipients at risk for sensitization and 26 sensitized recipients treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide pulse therapy together with intravenous immune globulin before transplant and as part of a cyclosporine-based triple immunosuppressive regimen after transplant. Preformed IgG anti-HLA antibodies predicted longer duration to transplantation, earlier cellular rejection, and 2.7-fold higher cumulative rejection frequency (P=0.002). Before transplant, cyclophosphamide reduced waiting time and mortality to levels in nonsensitized patients. After transplant, cyclophosphamide prevented induction of IgG anti-HLA class II antibodies and interleukin-2 receptor--positive T-cell outgrowth from biopsy sites (both P<0.01), prolonged the rejection-free interval (P=0.009), and reduced cumulative rejections to levels in nonsensitized patients (P=0.003). By multivariable analysis, the risk of rejection was 3.7-fold higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil than patients treated with cyclophosphamide (P=0.019). There were no differences in infectious or other significant complications. Immunosuppression incorporating intravenous cyclophosphamide before and after transplantation is safe and highly effective in sensitized cardiac transplant recipients. When used after transplantation as part of triple immunosuppression, cyclophosphamide is superior to mycophenolate mofetil in reducing rejection.

Isogeneic Lewis to Lewis and allogeneic Dark Agouti (DA) to Lewis rat cardiac transplants were studied 3 and 5 days after heterotopic intraabdominal transplantation (n=6/group). Myocardial blood flow (MBF), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), maximum pressure development (+dP/dt), and end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) were measured using an intraventricular balloon. Contractile response to dobutamine (5 microg/kg/min) was also assessed. In separate groups beta-adrenergic receptor density and adenylyl cyclase activity were measured in the grafts, in the recipients' native hearts and in native hearts of sham-operated controls. During mild to moderate rejection cardiac function indices remained unchanged, although MBF and contractile response to dobutamine decreased significantly (P<0.05) in the allogeneic group. The beta-adrenergic receptor density was significantly (P<0.05) increased in both isografts and allografts and in the native hearts of allografted recipients in comparison to native hearts of controls. Adenylyl cyclase activity showed a significant decrease (P<0.05) only in allografts. During severe rejection, LVSP and +dP/dt decreased and LVEDP increased in allografts in comparison to isografts (P<0.05). This was accompanied by a significant decrease in MBF, contractile response to dobutamine, beta-adrenergic receptor density, and adenylyl cyclase activity (P<0.05). Both microcirculatory disturbances and primary alteration in adenylyl cyclase activity may contribute to decreased contractile reserve in mild to moderate cardiac allograft rejection, whereas beta-adrenergic receptor density seems to be also influenced by cardiac denervation. Severe rejection leads to systolic and diastolic heart failure with complex dysregulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor/adenylyl cyclase pathway and impaired microcirculation.

The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate the effects of a tacrolimus-based immunosuppression on the skeleton and to investigate in a prospective, longitudinal, randomized, double-blind, study the effect of 0.25 microg calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) versus placebo in the prevention of bone loss and fracture rate after heart transplantion (HTx). A total of 53 patients (5 female, 48 male, mean age: 53+/-11 years) were randomized to the study medication. Basic therapy included calcium and sex hormone replacement in hypogonadism. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) were performed at baseline, after 12 and 24 months. Biochemical indexes of mineral metabolism were measured every 3 months. Overall bone mineral density (BMD) was significantly decreased after HTx (T-score-LS: 89+/-13%; FN: 88+/-14%).

Beyond the first 6 months after HTx, calcium, vitamin D, and hormone supplementation in hypogonadism lead sufficiently to bone mineral recovery. Besides immunosuppression, both concomitant hypogonadism and secondary hyperparathyroidism play a major role for the bone loss and should be therefore monitored and treated adequately.

The heart rate (HR) and O(2) uptake (VO(2)) responses to cycle ergometer exercise and the role of O(2) transport in limiting submaximal and maximal aerobic performance were assessed in 33 heart transplant recipients (HTR) [14 children (P-HTR), 11 young adults (YA-HTR) and 8 middle-age adults (A-HTR)] and in 28 age-matched control subjects (CTL). In 7 P-HTR (\"responders\") the HR response to the onset of exercise (on-response) was as fast as that of CTL, whereas in all other patients (\"non-responders\") the HR on-response was typical of the denervated heart. Compared with non-responder P-HTR, responder P-HTR were also characterized by a normal peak HR (177+/- 16 vs. 151+/- 25 beats/min), an equally slow time constant for the VO(2) on-response (tau: 54 +/- 11 vs. 62+/- 13 s) and a similar low (approximately 60% of that of CTL) peak VO(2) (28 +/- 7 vs. 26 +/- 10 ml/kg per min).

In conclusion, a sizeable number of paediatric patients (responder P-HTR) may reacquire the normal HR response to exercise, both in terms of kinetics and maximal level. Despite the almost complete recovery of cardiovascular function, and, probably, oxygen delivery, both the kinetics of the VO(2) on-response and the maximal aerobic power of the responder P-HTR were similar to those of non-responder P-HTR.

Cardiorespiratory synchronization, studied within the framework of phase synchronization, has recently raised interest as one of the interactions in the cardiorespiratory system. In this work, we present a quantitative approach to the analysis of this nonlinear phenomenon. Our primary aim is to determine whether synchronization between HR and respiration rate is a real phenomenon or a random one. First, we developed an algorithm, which detects epochs of synchronization automatically and objectively. The algorithm was applied to recordings of respiration and HR obtained from 13 normal subjects and 13 heart transplant patients. Surrogate data sets were constructed from the original recordings, specifically lacking the coupling between HR and respiration. The statistical properties of synchronization in the two data sets and in their surrogates were compared. Synchronization was observed in all groups: in normal subjects, in the heart transplant patients and in the surrogates. Interestingly, synchronization was less abundant in normal subjects than in the transplant patients, indicating that the unique physiological condition of the latter promote cardiorespiratory synchronization. The duration of synchronization epochs was significantly shorter in the surrogate data of both data sets, suggesting that at least some of the synchronization epochs are real. In view of those results, cardiorespiratory synchronization, although not a major feature of cardiorespiratory interaction, seems to be a real phenomenon rather than an artifact.

Prolonged cold ischemia has been suggested as a factor that will exacerbate later graft arterial disease (GAD), a major limiting factor for long-term transplant survival.

Mild GAD developed in isografts undergoing 4-hour cold ischemia. Relative to control isografts, cold ischemia induced transiently enhanced endothelial expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) at 4 hours post-transplant. There was also transiently-augmented gene expression of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and transforming growth factor-beta in these cold-ischemic isografts. By 3 days post-transplantation, however, there were no longer any differences between control and cold ischemic isografts. Cold ischemia did not significantly affect the final grade of either parenchymal rejection or GAD in long-term (4 to 12 weeks) major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I- or MHC II-mismatched allografts molecules transplanted without immunosuppression. At early time points after cold ischemia (4 to 24 hours), allografts mismatched for MHC I and/or MHC II showed enhanced expression of ICAM-1 and cytokines comparable to that seen in isografts. By day 7 post-transplant, both control and cold ischemia allografts showed comparable expression of cytokines and adhesion molecules.

In order for xenotransplantation to become a clinical reality, and fulfill its promise of overcoming shortages of human organs and tissues, rejection mediated by the host's immune system must first be overcome. In primates, preformed natural antibodies that bind the carbohydrate antigen Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GIcNAc-R (alphaGal), which is synthesized by UDP galactose:beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminide alpha(1-3)galactosyltransferase (E.C. 2.4.1.151) or simply alphaGT, mediate rigorous rejection of transplanted pig organs and tissues. In alphaGT knockout mice (GT0 mice), which like humans contain in their serum antibodies that bind alphaGal, expression of a retrovirally transduced alphaGT in bone marrow-derived cells is sufficient to prevent production of alphaGal-reactive antibodies. Here, we demonstrate that reconstitution of lethally irradiated GT0 mice with alphaGT-transduced bone marrow cells from GT0 littermates prevents antibody-mediated rejection of cardiac transplants from wild-type mice.

The aim of this study was to identify some of the mechanisms that could be involved in blunted ventilatory response (VE) to exercise in the supine (S) position. The contribution of the recruitment of different muscle groups, the activity of the cardiac mechanoreceptors, the level of arterial baroreceptor stimulation, and the hemodynamic effects of gravity on the exercising muscles was analyzed during upright (U) and S exercise. Delayed rise in VE and pulmonary gas exchange following an impulselike change in work rate (supramaximal leg cycling at 240 W for 12 s) was measured in seven healthy subjects and six heart transplant patients both in U and S positions. This approach allows study of the relationship between the rise in VE and O2 uptake (VO2) without the confounding effects of contractions of different muscle groups. These responses were compared with those triggered by an impulselike change in work rate produced by the arms, which were positioned at the same level as the heart in S and U positions to separate effects of gravity on postexercising muscles from those on the rest of the body. Despite superimposable VO2 and CO2 output responses, the delayed VE response after leg exercise was significantly lower in the S posture than in the U position for each control subject and cardiac-transplant patient (-2.58 +/- 0.44 l and -3.52 +/- 1.11 l/min, respectively). In contrast, when impulse exercise was performed with the arms, reduction of ventilatory response in the S posture reached, at best, one-third of the deficit after leg exercise and was always associated with a reduction in VO2 of a similar magnitude. We concluded that reduction in VE response to exercise in the S position is independent of the types (groups) of muscles recruited and is not critically dependent on afferent signals originating from the heart but seems to rely on some of the effects of gravity on postexercising muscles.

Complement plays a critical role in many pathologic processes and in xenograft rejection. Therefore, effective complement inhibitors are of great interest. In pig-to-primate organ transplantation, hyperacute rejection results from antibody deposition and complement activation. Complement activation blocker-2 (CAB-2), a recombinant soluble chimeric protein derived from human decay accelerating factor (DAF) and membrane cofactor protein, inhibits C3 and C5 convertases of both classical and alternative pathways. CAB-2 reduces complement-mediated tissue injury of a pig heart perfused ex vivo with human blood. Therefore, we studied the efficacy of CAB-2 when a pig heart is transplanted heterotopically into rhesus monkeys receiving no immunosuppression. Graft survival in three control monkeys was 1.26 +/- 0.2 h; it was markedly prolonged in eight monkeys that received CAB-2. Of the six monkeys that received a single dose of CAB-2 (15 mg/kg i.v.), four had graft survivals of 21, 95, 96, and 108 h, and two died at 7 to 11 h post-transplant with a beating graft, as a result of technical complications. The two monkeys given multiple doses of CAB-2 had graft survivals of 95 and 96 h. CAB-2 markedly inhibited complement activation, as shown by a strong reduction in generation of C3a and SC5b-9. At graft rejection, tissue deposition of iC3b, C4 and C9 was similar or slightly reduced from controls, and deposition of IgG, IgM, C1q and fibrin did not change. Thus, complement inhibition with CAB-2 abrogates hyperacute rejection of pig hearts transplanted into rhesus monkeys, but does not prevent delayed/acute vascular rejection. These studies demonstrate that the beneficial effects of complement inhibition on survival of a pig heart xenograft in rhesus monkeys are similar to those in other primate species and that CAB-2 may be useful in xenotransplantation and other complement-mediated conditions.

The cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) is secreted mainly by activated T lymphocytes and characterizes the T-helper 2 (Th2) sub-type. In transplantation Th2 cells are believed to induce graft tolerance. Previous studies revealed that patients with a relatively high frequency of IL-4 producing helper T lymphocytes (HTL) before heart transplantation (HTX) had no or less rejection episodes compared with patients with a low frequency of IL-4 producing HTL. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in the promoter region of the IL-4 gene, which influence promoter strength. We investigated whether there was a correlation between SNP genotypes in the IL-4 promoter and heart failure, and rejection after HTX. Seventy HTX patients, 61 donors, and 36 controls were genotyped for the 3 SNPs by sequencing. Of the SNPs at -285 and -81, only the C and A alleles, respectively, were found in this study. Both alleles were found for the -590 SNP. No relation between patient genotype of the SNP at -590 and heart failure and rejection was found. However, incidence of rejection was significantly lower in patients that received a donor heart with the T-positive genotype compared with patients that received a heart from a T-negative donor. Patients who had the T-negative genotype and received a heart from a T-positive donor, suffered significantly less from rejection than T-negative patients that received a T-negative donor heart. This was not significant in the T-positive patient group. This indicates that IL-4 production within the donor heart and by cells from the donor is important for reducing incidence of episodes of rejection.

Elevated pulmonary vascular resistance is a major limitation for heart transplantation. Urapidil is a centrally and peripherally acting anti-hypertensive drug, able to decrease elevated pulmonary vascular resistance in patients with either chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or heart failure. Urapidil is available as an oral or intravenous drug. In this study, we evaluated the possible beneficial effects of intravenous urapidil in patients with reversible, elevated pulmonary vascular resistance who were scheduled for heart transplantation. After approval by the Ethics Committee and written consent, 22 consecutive patients with end-stage heart failure and history of pulmonary vascular resistance >3 Wood units were enrolled into an open, prospective study. Using a (right ventricular ejection fraction) REF-Swan-Ganz catheter, hemodynamics were determined during administration of nitric oxide, and before and after 3 repeated intravenous applications of 10 mg urapidil. The treatment goal was reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance by at least 30%. Twenty-two patients were included to obtain complete data for 14 patients. Eight patients were not treated with urapidil: 7 patients had normal pulmonary vascular resistance at baseline, and 1 patient experienced moderate pulmonary edema before the study began. Two patients did not reach the treatment goal. In patients who responded to urapidil, the following hemodynamic changes were observed: decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (-48%), decreased transpulmonary gradient (20.0 to 13.7 mm Hg), decreased mean pulmonary arterial pressure (40 to 31 mm Hg), decreased systemic vascular resistance (-27%), mean arterial pressure (80 to 72 mm Hg), and increased right heart ejection fraction (21% to 27%). Heart rate remained unchanged. Intravenous urapidil lowered elevated pulmonary vascular resistance in patients before heart transplantation. In comparison with other vasodilative drugs, the major benefit of urapidil is its oral formulation.

Zinc (Zn) blocks caspase-3 activation in cardiac allografts and therefore may synergistically decrease apoptosis along with cyclosporine (CsA), which inhibits mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. Simultaneous treatment of rat recipients of heterotopic heart transplants with zinc chloride (ZnCl(2)) thus may allow lower doses of CsA for immunosuppression. PVG (RT1(c)) rat hearts were transplanted heterotopically into the abdomen of ACI (RT1(a)) rats. Group 1 (n = 15) rats received no treatment. Group 2 rats (n = 8) received 2 mg/kg/day CsA (sub-therapeutic dose) by oral gavage. Group 3 rats (n = 9) received 2 mg/kg/day oral CsA in addition to 1 mg/kg/day sub-cutaneous ZnCl(2) delivered by osmotic pump. All rats were imaged using Annexin V-bound (99m)Technetium ((99m)Tc-Annexin V) on post-operative Day 4 and subsequently killed. Annexin V avidly binds apoptotic cells in vivo. Region of interest per whole body (WB) data were calculated using the images. The allograft survival study was conducted with n = 11, 6, and 5 in control, CsA, and CsA+Zn groups, respectively. Finally, percentages of allografts that reached tolerance were measured in both CsA-only and CsA+Zn groups (n = 8 each). Zinc chloride had an additive effect with CsA on apoptotic blockade and graft survival. The regions of interest per WB uptake of (99m)Tc-Annexin V were 2.43% +/- 0.37%, 2.08% +/- 0.52%, and 1.49% +/- 0.29%*, and acute survivals were 6.4 +/- 1.7, 7.2 +/- 2.1, and 11.2 +/- 2.5* days for control, CsA, and CsA+Zn groups, respectively (*p < 0.001 vs controls). In addition, 87.5% of allografts became tolerant and survived for 90 days in the CsA+Zn group compared with only 37.5% in the CsA-only group (p = 0.049).

Some investigators have reported that high pressure during initial flush with UW solution may induce vasoconstriction and endothelial damage, because of its high potassium content and high viscosity. However, using lower pressure during the initial flush may lead to irregular distribution of the solution and incomplete flushing of blood components from coronary vascular beds. This experimental study evaluated the effects of a range of initial flush pressures during heart procurement, followed by orthotopic transplantation of the graft after 12 hours of preservation. Twelve pairs of adult mongrel dogs, weighing 9 to 14 kg, formed the recipient-donor combinations. After determining hemodynamic status by measuring cardiac output, left ventricular pressure (LVP), and maximum positive and negative change in LVP (+/-LVdP/dt), donor hearts were excised. Coronary vascular beds were flushed with 4 degrees C UW solution at a pressure of 60 mm Hg in the low-pressure group (n = 6) and at 120 mm Hg in the high-pressure group (n = 6). After 12 hours of cold preservation, orthotopic transplantation was performed using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The hemodynamics of the transplanted graft were assessed by comparing recovery rates (%) from donor hearts 2 hours after weaning from CPB. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels were measured in the blood obtained from the coronary sinus 30 minutes after reperfusion. The transplanted grafts were then harvested for histologic study and measurement of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content. Cardiac output, LVP, LVdP/dt and myocardial tissue ATP content were significantly better (p < 0.05) in the high-pressure group than in the low-pressure group. We found no significant differences in ET-1 levels between the groups. Transmission electron microscopic findings revealed that degeneration of the mitochondria was less extensive in the high-pressure group than in the low-pressure group. We observed no obvious ultrastructural damage to the endothelial cells in either group. When using UW solution in heart procurement, high pressure is better to completely wash out the blood components and distribute the solution.

Cardiac transplantation is the most successful therapy for refractory heart failure, but clinical transplantation is still confronted with the problems of acute rejection and acute pump failure. The limiting factor in achieving prolonged survival remains cardiac allograft vasculopathy. In recent years it has become apparent that from brain death onward, the cardiac endothelium plays a key role in these acute and chronic events. Brain death is associated with an inflammatory response that primes the endothelium for cumulative injury during the subsequent stages of ischemic cold storage, reperfusion and allorecognition. As a structural and functional interface, the endothelium is the site at which inflammatory cells move from the bloodstream through the vessel wall into the parenchyma. The endothelium interacts with the complement system, the coagulation and inflammatory cascades, circulating leukocytes, the immune system, the smooth muscle in the vessel wall, and the surrounding matrix and cardiomyocytes. A better understanding of its many roles may lead to expansion of our therapeutic possibilities and better outcomes overall. This article reviews the possible roles of the endothelium in relation to cardiac transplantation, and discusses the diagnostic and therapeutic modalities that are available to date.

LIGHT (TNFSF14), a tumor necrosis factor superfamily member expressed by activated T cells, binds to herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) which is constitutively expressed by T cells and costimulates T cell activation in a CD28-independent manner. Given interest in regulating the effector functions of T cells in vivo, we examined the role of LIGHT-HVEM costimulation in a murine cardiac allograft rejection model. Normal hearts lacked LIGHT or HVEM mRNA expression, but allografts showed strong expression of both genes from day 3 after transplant, and in situ hybridization and immunohistology-localized LIGHT and HVEM to infiltrating leukocytes. To test the importance of LIGHT expression on allograft survival, we generated LIGHT-/- mice by homologous recombination. The mean survival of fully major histocompatibility complex-mismatched vascularized cardiac allografts in LIGHT-/- mice (10 days, P < 0.05) or cyclosporine A (CsA)-treated LIGHT+/+ mice (10 days, P < 0.05) was only slightly prolonged compared with LIGHT+/+ mice (7 days). However, mean allograft survival in CsA-treated LIGHT-/- allograft recipients (30 days) was considerably enhanced (P < 0.001) compared with the 10 days of mean survival in either untreated LIGHT-/- mice or CsA-treated LIGHT+/+ controls. Molecular analyzes showed that the beneficial effects of targeting of LIGHT in CsA-treated recipients were accompanied by decreased intragraft expression of interferon (IFN)-gamma, plus IFN-gamma-induced chemokine, inducible protein-10, and its receptor, CXCR3. Treatment of LIGHT+/+ allograft recipients with HVEM-Ig plus CsA also enhanced mean allograft survival (21 days) versus wild-type controls receiving HVEM-Ig (mean of 7 days) or CsA alone (P < 0.001).

To assess whether diastolic graft function is influenced by intragraft interleukin 2 (IL-2) messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in rejecting cardiac allografts. 16 recipients of cardiac allografts were monitored during the first three months after transplantation. The presence of IL-2 mRNA in endomyocardial biopsies (n = 123) was measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. To determine heart function, concurrent M mode and two dimensional Doppler echocardiograms were analysed. Histological signs of acute rejection (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) rejection grade > 2) were strongly associated with IL-2 mRNA expression (IL-2 mRNA was present in 12 of 20 endomyocardial biopsies (60%) with acute rejection and in 24 of 103 endomyocardial biopsies (23%) without acute rejection, p = 0.002). No significant relation was found between either histology or IL-2 mRNA expression alone and the studied echocardiographic parameters. However, stratification of the echocardiographic data into those of patients with and those without acute rejection showed that during acute rejection IL-2 mRNA expression was significantly associated with increased left ventricular total wall thickness (mean change in total wall thickness was +0.22 cm in patients with IL-2 mRNA expression versus -0.18 cm in patients without IL-2 mRNA expression, p = 0.048). An increase in left ventricular total wall thickness precedes IL-2 positive acute rejection after heart transplantation. Thus, cardiac allograft rejection accompanied by intragraft IL-2 mRNA expression may be indicative of more severe rejection episodes.

The primary cause for late failure of vascularized allografts is chronic rejection (CR) characterized by transplant vascular sclerosis (TVS). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection accelerates TVS and CR by unclear mechanisms involving direct effects of CMV, indirect effects of the recipient's immune response to CMV, or interactions between CMV and the recipient's alloreactivity. This study examined the role of CMV and the alloreactive response in the development of TVS using bone marrow chimerism (BMC) in rat small bowel (SB) and heart transplantation models. Fisher 344 (F344) rat heart or SB grafts were transplanted into F344/Lewis bone marrow chimera. F344 heart or SB grafts transplanted into Lewis recipients (low-dose cyclosporine) were positive controls for the development of TVS. Lewis heart or SB grafts transplanted into Lewis recipients (+/-cyclosporine) were transplantation controls. The effect of rat CMV (RCMV) (5x105 plaque-forming units) on TVS (neointimal index, NI) and graft survival was studied in these groups. RCMV infection was assessed by serologic analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction techniques (TaqMan). RCMV infection accelerated the time to graft CR (SB 70-38 days; hearts 90-45 days) and increased the severity of TVS in both the SB allografts (day 38, NI=27 vs. 52) and the heart allografts (day 45, NI=43 vs. 83). Grafts from CMV-infected syngeneic recipients failed to develop TVS and CR. Donor-specific tolerance induced by BMC prevented allograft TVS and CR in both transplant models. In contrast to na\u00efve Lewis recipients, RMCV infection failed to cause allograft TVS and CR in bone marrow (BM) chimeras. The events in CMV-induced acceleration of TVS involve a crucial interplay between CMV infection and the recipient's alloreactive immune response.

This study evaluated association between C. pneumoniae infection and accelerated graft arteriosclerosis (AGA), also known as cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), after cardiac transplantation. A case-control study was performed with 54 heart transplant recipients at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Severe cases had >50% luminal narrowing on cardiac catheterization, mild cases <50% narrowing, and controls were free of arteriosclerotic disease. Blood specimens were examined for C. pneumoniae serology and DNA detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. For every twofold increase in geometric mean C. pneumoniae immunoglobulin (Ig)G titer, the odds ratio for severe AGA versus controls was 3.13 (P=0.03) and for mild AGA versus control patients was 1.61 (P=0.45). On Kaplan-Meier survival analysis there was a nonsignificant trend toward faster development of CAV in patients with higher C. pneumoniae antibody titers. Overall, 29% of heart transplant patients evaluated had evidence of circulating C. pneumoniae DNA by PCR, without a statistical difference between groups. C. pneumoniae IgG titer correlates with severity of allograft arteriosclerosis after cardiac transplantation. Circulating C. pneumoniae DNA is detectable by PCR in up to 30% of cardiac transplant recipients, but this does not correlate with severity of allograft vasculopathy.

During the last decades, transplantation has become an established tool for the treatment of terminal organ failure. Beside immunological factors, hyperlipidemia is the main problem after heart transplantation, causing rapid transplant coronary artery disease (TxCAD) and poor long-term prognosis at the beginning of the transplantation. Heart transplant recipients are now effectively treated with lipid lowering substances, of which HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors are the most potent. However, treatment with these substances correlates with an increased risk for the development of rhabdomyolysis due to therapy with the immunosuppressive cyclosporine A. Our study monitored the safety and efficacy of treatment with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor fluvastatin in heart transplant recipients compared to healthy controls. We investigated 10 patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy consisting of cyclosporine A, prednisone, and azathioprine who had increased concentrations of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), and 10 age-matched healthy controls. The patients were treated with 40 mg/day fluvastatin for 4 weeks and 20 mg/day for 4 additional weeks. Control individuals received 40 mg/day fluvastatin for 4 weeks only.

In addition, values of C(max.) and AUC(0h-24h) after administration of 40 mg/day fluvastatin for 4 weeks in both groups were slightly higher than at the beginning, whereas the value of CL was slightly lower (day 28, patients vs. controls, C(max.): 1530.4 +/- 960.4 ng/mL vs. 254.7 +/- 199.8 ng/mL; AUC(0h-24h): 2615.3 +/- 1379.4 ng/mL*h vs. 841.8 +/- 421.4 ng/mL*h; CL: day 28, 21.4 +/- 15.3 L/h vs. 61.5 +/- 36.6 L/h). Except for an intermittent increase of creatine kinase, safety parameters showed no increases within the observation period. Our data suggest that fluvastatin effectively lowers plasma concentrations of cholesterol and LDL-C in patients after heart transplantation, however, the metabolism of fluvastatin is affected by concomitant therapy with cyclosporine A.

During the LVAD support period, approximately 30% to 80% of LVAD recipients have positive test results for panel reactive antibodies (PRAs). Many of these antibodies form against human leukocyte antigens (HLA). These antigens are present on most cells and stimulate antibody production when a person receives unrelated donor cells. Several pre-LVAD and post-LVAD factors contribute to anti-HLA antibody formation.

Both animal models and clinical outcomes studies of transplantation suggest that antigen-independent mechanisms can alter graft survival and function. It has been suggested that antigen-independent processes interact with alloantigen-specific responses to augment the rejection reaction. A major link between antigen-specific adaptive immunity and pro-inflammatory stimuli is innate immunity. During transplantation, innate immunity may be stimulated by multiple factors, including ischemia, reperfusion, sterile injury, systemic stress, and cell death. We investigated the hypothesis that transplantation induces a potent innate immune response in a murine model of vascularized solid organ transplantation. In our studies, we analyzed three experimental groups: (a) alymphoid group in which both the donor and recipients strains lacked an adaptive immune response due to deletion of the recombinase activating gene, thus blocking production of both T cell and B cell antigen receptors; (b) syngeneic group in which the donors and recipients were genetically identical; and (c) allogeneic group in which the donors and recipients had a complete MHC mismatch. To analyze a large number of parameters we determined the level of expression of a panel of cytokines, chemokines, receptors, and cell surface markers by RNase protection assays. In addition, serum cytokines were determined by ELISA and the infiltration of inflammatory cells was assessed by histology.

Humoral or antibody-mediated rejection in cardiac transplant recipients is mediated by donor-specific cytotoxic antibodies and is histologically defined by linear deposits of immunoglobulin and complement in the myocardial capillaries. Antibody-mediated rejection often is accompanied by hemodynamic compromise and is associated with reduced long-term graft survival. Standard immunosuppression, designed to target T cell immune function, is largely ineffective against this B cell-driven process. Current treatment options for humoral rejection are limited by a lack of specific anti-B cell therapies. We present the case of a 50-year-old woman with hemodynamically significant humoral rejection resistant to steroids, cyclophos-phamide, and plasmapheresis who responded to the addition of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy (rituximab). One year posttransplant, the patient is rejection-free, with normal left ventricular systolic function and coronary arteries.

The main hurdle to clinical application of cardiac xenotransplantation is the immune response of the recipient against the graft. Although all xenografts arouse an intense immune response, the effect of that response depends very much on whether the graft consists of isolated cells or an intact organ, such as the heart. Intact organs, which are transplanted by primary vascular anastomosis, are subject to severe vascular injury owing to the reaction of immune elements with the endothelial lining of donor blood vessels. Vascular injury leads to hyperacute rejection, acute vascular rejection, and chronic rejection. The immunological basis for these types of rejection and potential therapies, which might be used to avert them, are discussed.

The assessment of remodeling in diffuse atherosclerosis by intravascular ultrasound is hampered by the lack of an appropriate reference segment. Transplant coronary artery disease is an accepted model of diffuse atherosclerosis. Flow-dependent remodeling is regulated by shear stress. Thus, normal levels of shear stress at baseline flow reflect adequate regulation and provide a functional assessment of flow-dependent remodeling. The approach was evaluated in 91 patients with transplant coronary artery disease and in 9 non-transplanted controls and 16 control transplant recipients. Quantitative coronary angiography, intracoronary ultrasound and intracoronary velocity studies were performed at baseline and after pharmacologic intervention. Calculated shear stress was compared between these groups and a sub-group with coronary angioplasty at follow-up (8 of 60 patients with control angiography after 23 +/- 8 months). The relation of shear stress to flow, diameter, flow/area ratio and endothelial function was analyzed. Normal shear stress was found in non-transplanted controls and transplant recipients without coronary artery disease. Patients with coronary angioplasty at follow-up had elevated shear stress and enhanced endothelial dysfunction on the initial investigation. Shear stress was not correlated with flow (r = 0.062, non-significant), but with diameter (r = -0.654), flow/area ratio (r = 0.814) and endothelial dysfunction (r = 0.722). Calculated local shear stress appears to be useful for the assessment of the adequacy of flow-dependent macrovascular remodeling in diffuse atherosclerosis.

Graft coronary artery disease (GCAD) is characterized by vascular narrowing resulting from intimal hyperplasia. Endothelin (ET)-1, derived from the vascular endothelium and macrophages, stimulates vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which leads to neointimal formation in donor graft coronary arteries. In this study, we hypothesized that antisense (AS) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) for preproendothelin-1 (ppET-1) delivered to rat cardiac allografts by means of hyperbaric pressure would reduce the incidence of GCAD. PVG donor hearts were infused with ppET-1 AS ODN (80 micromol/liter), sense ODN, scrambled ODN or saline alone and incubated in a pressure chamber at 75 psi or ambient pressure for 45 minutes. Cardiac allografts were heterotopically transplanted into ACI rats treated with cyclosporine (7.5 mg/kg, Days 0 to 9). Allografts were procured at post-operative days (POD) 7 or 90.

Potential reversibility of elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance was tested before transplantation with nitroprusside and nitric oxide, with follow-up cardiac catheterization performed 6 to 12 months after transplantation. The mean age of diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy was 6.3 years and the mean interval from diagnosis to referral for transplantation was 3.6 years. Elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance was common and tended to progress with longer follow-up. Three of the 8 patients had pulmonary vascular resistance indices greater than 10 Woods unit/m(2) and transpulmonary gradients greater than 20 mm Hg. The administration of nitroprusside and nitric oxide reversed elevated pulmonary resistance and transpulmonary gradients in all patients. Nitric oxide successfully reversed pulmonary vascular resistance in patients unresponsive to nitroprusside. All patients underwent successful transplantation and follow-up catheterization revealed normal pulmonary hemodynamics in each patient. Pediatric restrictive cardiomyopathy can be associated with marked elevation in the pulmonary vascular resistance, which may contribute to the poor prognosis in these patients and potentially make cardiac transplantation problematic.

The transplanted organs were examined histologically and stained for evidence of immunoglobulin and complement deposition as well as cellular infiltrates. In the transgenic animals survival times were 2 to 99 days (mean 23.5) and the heterotopic group and 1 to 39 days (mean 11.7) in the orthotopic group.

The amount of complement positive in the longer surviving organs was less than those rejecting early. Cellular infiltate was predominantly macrophage with some later appearing T or natural killer cells. The histopathological changes support the importance of immunoglobulin and complement in delayed xenograft or acute vascular rejection. With time there is an increase in cellular infiltrate predominantly macrophages and these findings suggest an increasingly important role for the cells and the rejection process. The presence of areas of infarction and underlying vascular thrombosis is in keeping with endothelial activation and the establishment of procoagulant phenotype which may be due to immunoglobulin, complement, secreted cytokines and direct cellular effects.

The interaction between CD40 on antigen-presenting cells and CD40L on T cells is critical in allograft rejection. CD154 blockade suppresses allograft rejection, but the role of this pathway in allograft vasculopathy remains obscure. A vascularized murine heterotopic cardiac transplant model was used to test whether perioperative CD154 blockade suppresses allograft vasculopathy or whether long-term CD154 blockade is required to suppress allograft vasculopathy. Perioperative CD154 blockade consisted of MR1 given on days -1, 1, and 3; long-term blockade consisted of MR1 given on days -1, 1, and 3 and continued twice weekly for 8 weeks. Allografts treated with perioperative or long-term CD154 blockade survived indefinitely. Perioperative and long-term treatment with control antibody (Ha4/8) resulted in uniform early rejection. Perioperative CD154 blockade transiently reduced early T-cell and macrophage infiltration in parallel with a transient reduction in endothelial adhesion receptor expression. Although perioperative CD154 blockade prevented allograft failure, it did not reduce allograft vasculopathy; mean neointimal cross-sectional area in perioperative MR1-treated and Ha4/8-treated recipients was 43+/-7% and 50+/-12%, respectively (P=NS).

We identified 5 male patients who had retained a female heart at least 9 months before death and necropsy.

The mean percentage of cardiomyocytes arising from the host was estimated to be 0.04% with a median of 0.016%. Most Y-positive cardiomyocytes were associated with regions of acute rejection, suggesting such chimerism involves an injury event.

Although disruption of these IFNgamma signaling pathways limits atherosclerosis and Tx-AA in animals, little is known about inhibitory regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production in humans. The present study investigated whether activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha and PPARgamma, with their known antiinflammatory effects, might regulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in human CD4-positive T cells. Isolated human CD4-positive T cells express PPARalpha and PPARgamma mRNA and protein. Activation of CD4-positive T cells by anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies significantly increased IFNgamma protein secretion from 0 to 504+/-168 pg/mL, as determined by ELISA. Pretreatment of cells with well-established PPARalpha (WY14643 or fenofibrate) or PPARgamma (BRL49653/rosiglitazone or pioglitazone) activators reduced anti-CD3-induced IFNgamma secretion in a concentration-dependent manner.

Vitamin C and E concentrations increased in the vitamin group (vitamin C 43 [SD 21] to 103 [43] mmol/L; vitamin E 24 [14] to 65 [27] mmol/L) but did not change in the placebo group (vitamin C 45 [15] vs 43 [16] mmol/L; vitamin E 27 [14] vs 27 [9] mmol/L; p<0.0001 for difference between groups). During 1 year of treatment, the intimal index increased in the placebo group by 8% (SE 2) but did not change significantly in the treatment group (0.8% [1]; p=0.008). Coronary endothelial function remained stable in both groups. Supplementation with antioxidant vitamins C and E retards the early progression of transplant-associated coronary arteriosclerosis.

Photopheresis has been used in the management of rejection of heart and/or lung transplants. Although its mechanism of action remains unknown, irradiated T-helper cell-induced immunosuppression is the main theory. Since transplant recipients are often lymphopenic and lymphocytes are the target cells in phototherapy, we performed this study to determine which factors affect the cellular yield to undergo irradiation. We reviewed the records of all photophereses performed in our institution between July 1998 and April 2000 using the UVAR (first generation) or XTS (second generation) instruments (Therakos, Exton, PA). Our data included patient's blood volume, absolute lymphocyte count and hematocrit, catheter type, flow rate of collection cycles and centrifuge bowl size, as well as volume, hematocrit, and lymphocyte count of the cell suspension. With a mixed model multivariate analysis we sought to determine which variables predicted the lymphocyte yield. A total of 406 procedures in 25 adult patients was analyzed. There was no significant difference between the lymphocyte yield among the procedures performed with the first- and the second-generation instruments. The patient's absolute lymphocyte count was the only parameter, which positively correlated with the total number of lymphocytes collected for irradiation (P < 0.0001). Indeed, based on the mixed model, the total number of lymphocytes for irradiation can be predicted from the pre-procedure lymphocyte count. Additional studies are necessary to correlate the number of treated cells with patient outcome. ", "label": 0}{"text": "[Echocardiography after orthotopic heart transplantation]. One of the most serious complications after orthotopic transplantation of the heart (OTH) is graft rejection. Its early detection can help successful control. The diagnostic gold standard is myocardial biopsy, it is however not always supreme. We tried to find out whether some modern echocardiographic methods can provide further valuable information. At the same time we were concerned with the follow up of basic variables of the circulation and echocardiographic indicators of left ventricular function. The authors examined repeatedly 22 patients where in 1998-2000 OTH was performed, who did not have an acute severe rejection, who had at least one myocardial biopsy between the first and second month after OTH without signs of rejection and who were easily examined by echocardiography. In addition to the standard follow up according to a routine pattern they were subjected to clinical and echocardiographic examination during the 1st-2nd month after OTH, 6 months after the first examination and one year after the second examination. Classical echocardiography, acoustic densitometry and Doppler tissue examination of the movement of the mitral ring were used. The patients had throughout the investigation period clinical cardiological complications. Between the first and second examination the systolic pressure rose from 125.4 +/- 9.5 to 135.4 +/- 13.5 mm Hg (p < 0.05), the diastolic pressure from 79.6 +/- 8.2 to 86.4 +/- 9.5 mm (p < 0.05), during the third examination it dropped again to original values. During the follow up no significant differences developed in indicators of classical echocardiography, acoustic densitometry and Doppler tissue echocardiography. Of 22 patients however myocardial biopsy of the right ventricle proved rejection only in two. In those the authors did not observe any echocardiographic changes during rejection. In one patient who died echocardiography revealed a decline of left ventricular function and a non-specific bioptic finding, and on necropsy severe cellular vascular rejection. Blood pressure rises early in some patients after OTH, it is therefore important to monitor it carefully and to administer early and systematic treatment of hypertension. In non-complicated patients the echocardiographic findings did not change. Because of the low number of rejections the authors were not able to prove the importance of some new echocardiographic methods. In view of discrepancies between methods in some patients with rejection a comprehensive diagnostic approach is still necessary: myocardial biopsy supplemented by further examinations, in particular echocardiographic ones.

We sought to determine the survival experiences of patients bridged to heart transplantation with either intravenous (IV) inotropes or an implantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Because of the operative risks of LVAD implantation and the reported lower mortality associated with inotropic therapy, bridging to heart transplantation with inotropes is thought to be the preferred treatment option. Between April 1, 1996, and May 10, 2001, a total of 104 patients were bridged to heart transplantation with either IV inotropes (n = 38) or an implantable LVAD (n = 66; HeartMate). Survival was compared (Kaplan-Meier method) for three periods: survival to transplantation, post-transplantation survival and overall survival (i.e., survival from the onset of bridging to follow-up). Survival to transplantation was 81 +/- 5% at three months for the LVAD group and 64 +/- 11% for the inotrope group (p = NS). Post-transplantation survival was 95 +/- 4% at three years for the LVAD group (two deaths) and 65 +/- 10% at three years for the inotrope group (nine deaths; p = 0.007). Overall survival was 77 +/- 6% at three years for the LVAD group and 44 +/- 9% at three years for the inotrope group (p = 0.01).

From a series of 60 consecutive heart transplant patients, we identified 13 patients with LAc in the first hours following HTX. Nine patients with normal or mildly elevated lactate levels (<5.0 mmol/l) were investigated as controls. Thirteen patients developed a moderate or severe LAc (up to 14.6 mmol/l) after HTX. Serum lactate levels increased immediately following surgery with a peak after 6.3+/-1.4 h, spontaneously returning to normal values within 24 h. In contrast to the control group, a significant correlation was found between the maximal serum lactate level and the maximal dosage of inotropic drugs (r=0.93, P<0.02), administered during the reperfusion phase and continued for 12-24 h postoperatively. No correlation was found between LAc and blood gas analysis during extracorporeal perfusion period. LAc can occur after HTX and seems to be related to the inotropic support of the graft. In contrast to other forms, LAc after HTX has an excellent prognosis and resolves rapidly and spontaneously without treatment.

We hypothesized that localized IL-10 gene transfer can induce alloreactive T cell apoptosis and tested this hypothesis with liposome-mediated ex vivo intracoronary IL-10 gene transfer using a functional heterotopic allograft heart transplant model in rabbits. Localized IL-10 overexpression prolonged cardiac allograft survival over three folds. In parallel with the time-course of IL-10 overexpression, the percentage of apoptotic CD3+ cells among total CD3+ cells was significantly increased in the gene therapy group (36.5+/-3.9%) compared with that in the control group (6.2+/-2.6%, P<0.01) on postoperative day (POD) 3-6, and it was further increased (45.8+/-5.7%) on POD7-10. Apoptotic CD4+ and CD8+ cells were also significantly increased in the gene group (P<0.01). In contrast, the percentage of apoptotic myocytes significantly decreased from 10.1+/-0.8% in the control group to 3.5+/-0.4% in the gene group on POD7-10 (P<0.01). This reduction was inversely correlated with the increase in the percentages of apoptotic CD4+ and CD8+ cells (P<0.01). The percentage of caspase-3 positive myocytes was significantly reduced, although percentages of caspase-3 positive CD4+ and CD8+ cells were markedly increased in the gene group (P<0.01). Moreover, about 60-80% of apoptotic T lymphocytes expressed Fas in the gene group compared with less than 10% in the control group (P<0.01). These results suggest that localized IL-10 gene transfer induces alloreactive T cell apoptosis via the Fas/FasL pathway that may contribute to the alleviated acute rejection, improved cardiac function, and prolonged survival in the IL-10 gene-treated cardiac allografts.

In animal models, endothelin-1 (ET-1) blockade attenuates transplant vasculopathy and chronic allograft dysfunction even in the absence of cyclosporine (CsA). As CsA has side effects and ET-1 antagonism alone has significant benefits, we postulated that allograft survival could be significantly improved by combining an endothelin-converting enzyme inhibitor with low-dose CsA. Survival of Lewis to Fisher 344 rat heterotopic cardiac allografts was determined in untreated animals and compared with those treated with high-dose CsA (62 mg/kg i.m. on day 2), low-dose CsA (25 mg/kg), an endothelin-converting enzyme inhibitor, phosphoramidon (PA, 10 mg/kg/day), or low-dose CsA + PA. Untreated allografts had a median survival of 16 days compared with 20 days for low-dose CsA. Grafts treated with PA survived for 28 days, and combination of PA and low-dose CsA improved median survival to 47 days (P<0.01). Median survival with combination therapy was similar to that for high-dose CsA (42 days). To explore mechanisms underlying the benefits of combination therapy, cardiac allografts treated as above (n=4 each group) were explanted at 20 d and analyzed for parenchymal rejection, neointimal vasculopathy, myocardial fibrosis, and macrophage infiltration. Low-dose CsA alone but not PA improved parenchymal rejection; in contrast, PA alone but not low-dose CsA improved vasculopathy. Both parenchymal rejection and vasculopathy were improved by combination therapy with low-dose CsA and PA. Unlike CsA, inhibition of ET-1 biosynthesis significantly reduced myocardial fibrosis in allografts. These results suggest that the combination of low-dose CsA and endothelin-converting enzyme inhibition may prove useful to improve long-term graft survival while minimizing potential side effects of CsA.

We have described that chimeric rat hearts bearing recipient-type antigen-presenting cells (APCs) do not reject acutely, but develop cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) in untreated recipients. This suggests that CAV is triggered either by CD8+ direct allorecognition or by CD4+ indirect allorecognition. To determine the allorecognition pathway responsible for CAV in this model, recipients of chimeric hearts underwent either CD8+ or CD4+ T cell depletion. Chimeric hearts were created via bone marrow transplantation in two fully major histocompatibility-mismatched rat strain combinations. DA recipients were thymectomized and treated with Ox8 and Ox38 murine monoclonal antibodies, which deplete CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, respectively. Chimeric PVG hearts bearing DA APCs, abbreviated PVG(DA), were heterotopically transplanted into recipients undergoing thymectomy alone or recipients undergoing thymectomy plus either CD4+ or CD8+ T cell depletion. PVG(DA) allografts survived 100 days, but developed CAV in thymectomized recipients and in those permanently depleted of CD8+ T cells. In contrast, chimeric hearts transplanted into permanently CD4+ T cell-depleted recipients survived 100 days and demonstrated no evidence of CAV. In this specific strain combination, recipient CD8+ T cells are neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of CAV, whereas recipient CD4+ T cells are required for the development of CAV. These findings suggest that CAV is dependent on CD4+ indirect allorecognition and that CD8+ direct allorecognition stimulated by nonprofessional APCs plays a minor role.

Male HTX patients and healthy, age-matched controls were studied. Seven HTX patients (age: 60 +/- 6 yr; 6 +/- 2 yr of HTX) participated in an outpatient training program, six HTX patients (age: 63 +/- 8 yr; 7 +/- 1 yr of HTX) maintained a sedentary lifestyle without regular physical exercise since transplantation.

The factors influencing outcome in 24 patients (15 adults and nine children) with CF who have received single liver transplantation, triple heart-lung-liver transplantation (tx) or died while being assessed for triple grafting, were analyzed. Median age at tx in single liver recipients (13 years) was lower than in triple graft recipients (21 years) and those who died (23 years). All patients who received single liver tx made an excellent recovery, including significant improvement of their respiratory function (mean forced vital capacity (FVC) increased from 61% before transplantation to 82% of expected, 6-9 months after tx). Four out of five patients who received triple tx died (0-2 months) after operation. On the basis of our retrospective review, we propose modifications to an existing scoring system for liver tx assessment in CF by scoring additional points for elevated white blood count, bilirubin, and impaired pulmonary function. These changes will need to be evaluated prospectively to confirm their predictive value. Liver transplantation is effective therapy in young patients with cystic fibrosis, portal hypertension and hepatic dysfunction, and is indicated before a critical stage of deteriorating lung function is reached.

Cardiac allograft rejection, previously considered a major cause of early mortality after transplantation, is no longer the limiting factor for early survival, with the use of newer and more specific immunosuppression regimens. Very few randomized, prospective trials, including comparisons between immunosuppression regimens, have been conducted in this area. Therefore, practices vary with physician and institutional experience. Most centers use a multipronged approach to immunosuppression, targeting multiple sites in the immune cascade that lead to allograft rejection. Multiple new agents in development are reviewed. Drugs such as sirolimus and its derivative, everolimus, act on specific intracellular receptors within lymphocytes, whereas other medications such as Daclizumab (Roche Laboratories, Nutley, NJ) block the interleukin-2 receptor on the surface of activated T cells.

Recently, the apoptotic volume decrease was suggested to be regulated by volume regulatory Cl- channels in cultured cell lines. We thus examined whether inhibition of volume-regulatory Cl- channels is cardioprotective, like caspase inhibition, by hindering the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes induced by global ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in vivo. We performed global ischemia for 8 min at 37 degrees C or 4 degrees C in isolated rat hearts, followed by 24-hr reperfusion via heterotopic heart transplantation. The heart tissue was examined by means of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method, genomic DNA electrophoresis, and caspase-3 activity. Two blockers of volume-regulatory Cl- channels, 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoate (NPPB), and a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, benzoyloxycarbonyl-Asp-CH2OC(O)-2,6-dichlorobenzene (Z-Asp-DCB), were administered intravenously. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and ultrasound cardiography were performed to examine myocardial viability. The TTC-unstained region was assessed by means of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) infiltration and the TUNEL method. The transplanted hearts showed TUNEL-positivity and DNA laddering with a peak at 24 hr during reperfusion after ischemia at 37 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C. NPPB and DIDS were as potent as Z-Asp-DCB for recovery of cardiac function and for blocking the appearance of TUNEL-positivity, DNA laddering, caspase 3 activity, and a TTC-unstained area. TTC-unstained areas were composed of either TUNEL- and slightly HRP-positive or TUNEL-negative and strongly HRP-positive cardiomyocytes. The present results demonstrated that myocardial DNA fragmentation, caspase activation, and loss of cardiac function after global I/R were blocked by NPPB and DIDS, similar to in the case of Z-Asp-DCB.

The various toxicities associated with the general immune suppression resulting from current clinical immunosuppressive therapies continue to plague transplant recipients as well as jeopardize allograft survival. The present study utilized allochimeric class I MHC antigens (alpha1hu70-77-RT1.Aa) bearing only four donor RT1.Au polymorphic amino acids (a.a.; His70, Val73, Asn74, and Asn77) superimposed on the recipient RT1.Aa background to induce transplantation tolerance in the rat cardiac transplant model. Oral delivery of alpha1hu70-77-RT1.Aa protein alone (days 0-6) induced tolerance, as evidenced by inhibition of both acute and chronic rejection processes. Delivery of alpha1hu70-77-RT1.Aa with therapeutic doses of cyclosporine (CsA) also prevented chronic rejection, otherwise readily developed after treatment with CsA alone. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based analysis showed that tolerant recipients had reduced numbers of interleukin (IL)-2/interferon (IFN)-gamma-producing T helper (Th)1 cells and elevated numbers of IL-4/IL-10-producing Th2 cells. Adoptive transfer experiments revealed that potent regulatory T cells mediated tolerance. The same T cells displayed diminished T cell receptor (TCR)-driven signaling via extracellular regulated kinase, AP-1, and NF-kappaB, as well as the common gamma-chain (gammac) cytokine-receptor-induced signaling by Janus kinase 3 (Jak3)/stimulators and activators of transcription Stat/5 pathways.

Finally, partial or complete tyrosine phosphorylation of Zap70 was observed in alloantigen-specific T cell clones in response to tolerogenic versus immunogenic peptides, respectively.

Each episode of rejection increased serum cholesterol by 0.306 mmol/liter (0.258, 0.355) [mean (95% C.I.)] and serum triglyceride by 0.164 mmol/liter (0.12, 0.209) although switching to TAC improved total cholesterol and LDL-C/HDL-C. Administration of frusemide, increased the total cholesterol and LDL-C/HDL-C whereas administration of bumetanide or metolazone increased the concentration of serum triglyceride. Serum glucose was associated with hypertriglyceridemia whereas serum creatinine was associated with increases in the total cholesterol, LDL-C/HDL-C and triglyceride. We have identified demographic and postoperative covariables that predispose heart transplant recipients to hyperlipidemia. Some of these risk factors, such as the effect of diuretics, have not been identified before in this group of patients and may be amenable to modification or closer control. TAC rather than CYA may be the immunosuppressive of choice for patients who are at greater risk of developing hyperlipidemia.

The major hinderance for long-term survival after lung transplantation is chronic rejection in the form of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). BOS is a fibrosing process in the small airways causing irreversible airway obstruction. BOS is associated with increased oxidative burden and activation of inflammatory and growth-stimulating mediators. The Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP or CC16) is a secreted differentiation marker for the bronchiolar epithelium with both antioxidative and antiinflammatory/immmunomodulatory properties. We asked whether this molecule could have a role in the development of BOS. Serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples were collected from 22 consecutive lung transplant recipients, the majority (19) was followed for 2 years. Six patients developed BOS. CCSP in serum was measured in 162 samples from 19 patients with an ELISA method, and CCSP in 191 BAL samples from 22 patients with quantitative Western blot. CCSP in both serum and BAL was significantly lower in BOS compared with acute rejection or no rejection. After the first postoperative month, serum and BAL CCSP levels were consistently lower in the patients who developed BOS than in those who did not. The percentage of neutrophils in BAL correlated negatively with CCSP in BAL. Levels of CCSP in serum and BAL is lowered in BOS. Serum CCSP could have a potential as an early marker for BOS. The correlation between decreased CCSP and increased neutrophils in BAL suggests a loss of local airway defense capacity in BOS.

There is increasing evidence that ongoing T-cell recognition of alloantigen and activation are key mediators of chronic allograft rejection. The CD28-B7 pathway is unique among costimulatory pathways in that two alternate ligands for B7 exist: CD28 and CTLA4. Recently, it has been suggested that CTLA4 negative signaling may be required for induction of acquired tolerance in vivo. A strategy by which the T cell is targeted at the CD28 receptor rather than its ligands would theoretically allow the inhibitory functions of the CTLA4-B7-1/2 axis to remain intact. Using a rat-specific monoclonal antibody, we investigated the effect of targeting CD28 in a model of chronic rejection without the confounding variable of immunosuppression. We also used an acute cardiac allograft rejection model to investigate CD28 stimulation-based strategies to induce donor-specific tolerance. We demonstrated that anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody was as effective as CTLA4 immunoglobulin in protecting against chronic allograft vasculopathy. In addition, a short course of cyclosporine therapy synergized with either anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody or CTLA4 immunoglobulin, suggesting that it may be clinically relevant to combine low-dose calcineurin inhibitors with CTLA4 immunoglobulin or anti-B7 antibodies. Finally, we report on the potential mechanisms of action of targeting CD28 in vivo.

Donor lymphocytes infused after organ transplantation can have strong immunoregulatory effects. Application of such protocols for transplant tolerance induction in a clinical setting will, however, require combination of specific immunomodulatory strategies with nonspecific immunosuppressive medication for safety reasons. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of immunosuppressive treatment on tolerance induction protocols by posttransplantation donor lymphocyte infusion. The interaction of postoperative donor leukocyte infusion with different types, dosage, and timing of immunosuppressive drugs were studied in a rat model of heart transplantation. Tolerance could be achieved if donor cell infusion was combined with delayed, but not immediate, low-dose cyclosporine treatment, and this was associated with activation and apoptosis of host lymphocytes. In contrast, combinations with an antibody against the interleukin 2 receptor led to long-term graft survival but severe chronic rejection, and combinations with high-dose cyclosporine or sirolimus led to acute rejection. Postoperative donor leukocyte infusion is a potential way for tolerance induction, but the type, dose, and timing of medication are highly critical for its efficacy.

A total of 17 heart and 19 lung transplant recipients received antithymocyte globulin (ATGAM or thymoglobulin) as induction therapy or to treat steroid-resistant acute or chronic rejection. Absolute CD3 counts were maintained between 50 and 100 cells/microl. With CD3 monitoring, the doses of antithymocyte globulin were reduced from 10-15 mg/kg to 1-5 mg/kg during the course of therapy. The total amount of antithymocyte globulin given to each CD3 monitored patient was reduced by 48%. Dose reduction did not alter the number of acute rejection or infectious episodes, and hematological side effects were infrequent.

Specific blockade by antibodies (Abs) utilized in induction therapy may cause activation-induced cell death (AICD) in lymphocytes of transplant recipients, preactivated via CD95 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha receptor type 1 (TNFR1), and reduce allograft rejection frequency. Amongst 618 heart transplant (HTX) patients receiving antithymocytes globulin (ATG) therapy, 14 recipients with IVUS-verified freedom of transplant vasculopathy were studied. The control group contained 14 patients awaiting transplantation, classified by the New York Hearth Association heart failure as class IV. From 618 HTX patients 89% were free of rejection grade ISHLT > or =2-3 within 3-month post transplantation and 86% after one year. The death inducing receptors (DIR) such as CD95, CD95L and soluble TNFR1 were significantly increased in HTX recipients versus controls, as demonstrated by FACS, immunoblotting or ELISA (P < 0.001). The presence of increased DIR and in vivo apoptosis in HTX recipients, indicated by annexin-V binding, was further confirmed by the presence of high concentration of histones in the sera of patients. ATG, anti-IL-2R and OKT-3 Abs inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The induction of apoptosis and/or necrosis was demonstrated in cells cultured with these Abs by annexin-V and 7-aminoactinomycin staining, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that T cells from HTX recipients express high level of CD95, CD95L and soluble TNFR1, and undergo apoptosis and AICD.

Ex vivo propagation of graft infiltrating lymphocytes has become a useful method for the examination of the cellular response after allogeneic transplantation. The aim of the present study was to investigate if this method can be used also for isolation of xenograft infiltrating cells, and, if so, to further characterize these cells. The concordant mouse-to-rat heart transplantation model was used for the experiments. Recipient rats were treated either with 15-deoxyspergualin (DSG) or with a combination of DSG and cyclosporine A (CyA) or left untreated. Transplants were removed beating on day 2 (untreated) or day 8 (DSG and CyA + DSG) and biopsies were incubated in culture medium for 48 h, resulting in propagation of cells from the biopsies into culture medium. The propagated cells were counted and phenotyped using flow cytometry. In parallel, the transplants were examined morphologically and immunohistochemically. Infiltrating cells could be isolated from all grafts in all groups. The number of propagated T lymphocytes during cellular rejection (DSG-treatment) was about 3.5 times higher than during 'non-rejection' (CyA + DSG) and six times higher than during acute vascular rejection (untreated). These findings were supported both by the morphological and the immunohistochemical findings. In conclusion, we have shown that graft infiltrating lymphocytes can be isolated from xenogeneic heart transplants by incubation of biopsies for 48 h, resulting in spontaneous propagation of immune cells into culture medium. Propagated cells could be further characterized by flow cytometry. Thus, the technique presented here can be used as a tool for studies of xenogeneic cellular rejection.

Previous studies showed low resting phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate (PCr/ATP) ratios within this patient population compared with controls; however, these low PCr/ATP did not correlate with endomyocardial biopsy rejection. One possible explanation is the presence of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), which might be manifested as a transient ischemic event in the mildly stressed transplanted heart. If transient ischemia is invoked through the (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) stress test, monitoring of such an event should be achievable and thus implicating possible ischemic involvement. Heart transplant patients (n = 25) and normal controls (n = 11) were studied using the (31)P MRS stress test; 10 patients tested positive (> 2 standard deviations [SDs] from control values). Patients also were monitored for heart rate and blood pressure with the handgrip exercise generating a small increase in the rate-pressure product. The percent change (%Delta) in the PCr/ATP ratio in the control group was 1.50% +/- 10.6; the transplant population showed an overall change of -6.7% +/- 18.5. The responders, those that were at or below the 2 SD line from control, had a -25.6 +/- 3.6% Delta PCr/ATP; whereas the non-responders reflect a 5.1 +/- 13.4%. The responders' response is quite striking when considering the threshold for an abnormal PCr/ATP %Delta in response to stress testing was -19.7%, which was the 2 SD mark below the mean value for the reference population.

Steroid-free immunosuppression is feasible in selected patients after heart transplantation. Survival and incidence of acute rejection are important parameters to evaluate when weighing risks and benefits of steroid withdrawal. One hundred thirty-seven patients were retrospectively reviewed who underwent heart transplant at Emory University between January 1988 and April 1994 and survived >1 year. Standard immunosuppression (cyclosporine, azathioprine and prednisone) without induction therapy was used. Weaning from steroids was attempted in all patients. Scheduled endomyocardial biopsy was used for long-term surveillance screening. Seventy-two patients (52.5%) underwent successful prednisone withdrawal (Group P0) at an average of 13 months after heart transplant, whereas 65 patients (47.5%) did not achieve steroid-free immunosuppression (Group P1). Group P0 had a mean of 1.3 treated rejection episodes (ISHLT Grade > or = 1b) during the first post-transplant year and Group P1 a mean of 2.3 (p <0.0001). In Group P0, 40 patients (55.6%) suffered a subsequent acute rejection with an ISHLT Grade > or = 1b, resulting in treatment. Of these, 15% were ISHLT Grade 1b, 47.5% Grade 2, 35% Grade 3a and 2.5% Grade 3b. The estimated risk of suffering from acute rejection of at least Grade 1b after achieving steroid-free immunosuppression was 50% at 21 months. Estimated survival at 5 years after heart transplant was 92.9% in Group P0 and 72.3% in Group P1 (p <0.01). Cox proportional hazard modeling revealed black recipient race as effect modifier of group status with decreased survival time in both groups. Steroid-free immunosuppression in white heart transplant recipients is associated with improved survival. A low acute rejection score during the first year predicts successful steroid withdrawal. Black recipient race appears to be negatively associated with survival and deserves further detailed study. Long-term surveillance screening using endomyocardial biopsy is recommended.

SRL was used in 20 LTx and 5 HTx recipients >90 days post-transplant, where serious renal impairment was limiting CI dosing. Patients started on 2 to 5 mg/day orally at a median of 1,185 days post-transplant. Dosage adjustments were made according to trough levels, toxicity and perceived efficacy. With SRL initiation, 48% ceased CI therapy and the remainder decreased their dose substantively. After 30 days, 4 of 5 dialyzed patients ceased dialysis and 15 of 20 patients with an elevated serum creatinine (Cr) (mean Cr 0.29 mmol/liter) improved their Cr. The direction of change in Cr at 30 days predicted longer term Cr. The starting Cr did not predict the 30-day or long-term value. There were two bouts of acute and one bout of chronic rejection. There were 35 infectious complications in 16 patients and 24 episodes of potential SRL-related toxicity in 17 patients. These events generally responded to dose reduction or temporary cessation and were level-related. Fifteen recipients presently remain on the drug. None of the 7 deaths could be directly related to toxicity. SRL is a useful alternative immunosuppressant, allowing significant CI withdrawal in transplant recipients with renal impairment.

To assess the potential of the donor heart to respond to interleukin-6 (IL6), the present study investigated the expression of IL6 receptor components in the myocardium of donor hearts before transplantation. Donor heart dysfunction early after transplantation has been associated with the cytokine storm after donor brain death. Proinflammatory cytokines are thought to play a central role in this process. Interleukin-6 is of specific interest because it has been associated with cardiac allograft dysfunction and is related to an impaired prognosis. Its action requires expression of the specific IL6 receptor (IL6R), and the common signal transducer of the IL6 family glycoprotein 130 (gp130) in the donor heart. The activation of IL6, IL6R and gp130 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein was studied via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistology in donor hearts (n = 6) and compared with patients undergoing evaluation of ventricular arrhythmias (control, n = 9) or with advanced heart failure (n = 20). Messenger RNA of IL6, IL6R and gp130 was strongly expressed in all chambers of donor hearts, whereas right ventricles of control patients did not show any expression (donor vs. control: p < 0.005). Right ventricles of failing hearts showed IL6, IL6R and gp130 mRNA levels comparable with those found in donor hearts. Immunohistochemistry paralleled the RT-PCR data on the protein level. While IL6 was mainly expressed by myocytes, both receptor components were preferentially found mainly on interstitial cells. The expression of the IL6 receptor components in the donor heart before transplantation establishes the condition sine qua non for the response of the donor heart to circulating IL6. This mechanism may explain the close association of elevated IL6 serum levels to acute cardiac allograft dysfunction in the early perioperative period.

Significance was defined as P <.05. Over this 8-year period, PI occurred in 8 (7%) of 116 patients (0.86% annual risk). No child had >1 diagnosed episode of PI. Of these 8 cases, 7 presented with 1 or more abdominal symptoms. Three of these children had rotavirus antigen isolated in their stool, 2 others were noted to have stool positive for Clostridium difficile toxin, and in the other 3, no pathogen was identified.

Long-term allografts displayed minimal cell infiltration with no signs of chronic rejection. CD4+ spleen T cells from tolerant LF15-0195-treated recipients were able to suppress in vitro proliferation of allogeneic CD4+ T cells and to transfer tolerance to second syngeneic recipients, demonstrating dominant suppression by regulatory cells. A significant increase in the percentage of CD4+CD25+ T cells was observed in the thymus and spleen from tolerant LF15-0195-treated recipient. In vitro direct stimulation with donor APCs demonstrated that CD4+ regulatory T cells proliferated weakly and expressed low levels of IFN-gamma, IL-10, and IL-2. CD4+CD25+ cell depletion increased IL-2 production by CD4+CD25- thymic cells, but not splenic cells. Moreover, tolerance was transferable with splenic and thymic CD4+CD25+ cells, but also in 50% of cases with splenic CD4+CD25- cells, demonstrating that CD25 can be a marker for regulatory cells in the thymus, but not in the periphery.

Recently, using a global method of T cell repertoire analysis, we showed that purified naive T cells confronted in vitro with allogeneic APCs in a direct pathway-restricted MLR up-regulate their Vbeta mRNAs without exhibiting skewing of complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) length distribution. In this report, using this approach, we show in vivo that Vbeta transcript regulation and CDR3 length distribution follow the same pattern during acute rejection of MHC-incompatible heart allografts. In contrast, in tolerance induction by priming of recipients with donor cells, the vigorous Vbeta mRNA accumulation with Gaussian CDR3 length distribution is abolished, providing a possible explanation for the down-regulation of activated T cells in tolerant animals. In addition, tolerated grafts harbor T cells with a highly altered repertoire, suggestive of self-restricted presentation with some patterns corresponding to previously identified regulatory cells.

Blockade of T cell costimulatory pathways can result in the prolongation of allograft survival through the suppression of Th1 responses; however, late allograft rejection is usually accompanied by an emerging allograft-specific humoral response. We have recently determined that intact active bone (IAB) fragments transplanted under the kidney capsule can synergize with transient anti-CD40 ligand (CD40L) treatment to induce robust donor-specific allograft tolerance and suppress the alloantibody response. In this study, we take advantage of the ability of galactosyltransferase-deficient knockout (GT-Ko) mice to respond to the carbohydrate epitope, galactose-alpha1,3-galactose (Gal), to investigate whether IAB plus transient anti-CD40L therapy directly tolerize B cell responses. GT-Ko mice tolerized to Gal-expressing C3H hearts and IAB plus transient anti-CD40L therapy were challenged with pig kidney membranes that express high levels of Gal. The anti-Gal IgM and IgG responses were significantly suppressed in IAB-tolerant mice compared with controls, while the non-Gal anti-pig Ab responses were comparable. The anti-pig T cell cytokine response (IFN-gamma and IL-4) was comparable in IAB-tolerant and control mice. The tolerant state for the anti-Gal IgM response could be reversed with repeated immunization, whereas the tolerant state for the IgG response was robust and resisted repeated immunization. These observations provide an important proof-of-concept that adjunct therapies can synergize with anti-CD40L Abs to tolerize B cell responses independent of their effects on T cells. This model, which does not require mixed chimerism, provides a unique opportunity for investigating the mechanism of peripheral tolerance in a clinically relevant population of carbohydrate-specific B cells.

To evaluate the efficacy of metronidazole on cyclosporine-induced gingival overgrowth (GO), a prospective intra-subject double-blind longitudinal study was performed on six heart transplant patients with GO. All patients underwent scaling and root planing before any treatment. Metronidazole gel (Elyzol, Cabon) was then applied in two of the four anterior hemi-sextants of each subject, following a balanced random pre-programmed list, with a placebo gel being applied to the remaining two hemi-sextants. Plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing (BP) and probing depth (PD) were recorded for all teeth of the four anterior hemi-sextants before and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 months after gel application. A general linear model was fitted and ANOVA for repeated measurements with split-plot design and Chi-square analysis were used for statistical analysis. PD significantly decreased after 1 month following both treatments. Analogous results were obtained as regards PI and BP. No statistically significant difference was detected between results obtained with metronidazole and placebo. However, PD in the group of teeth treated with placebo significantly increased after 4 months, while PD values obtained from teeth treated with metronidazole remained statistically unchanged with respect to the 1st month. In conclusion, short-term results suggest that metronidazole and placebo are equally effective in reducing periodontal parameters and GO when associated with scaling and root planing. Long-term results, however, showed greater efficacy of metronidazole with respect to placebo in controlling cyclosporine-induced GO.

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G, a nonclassic major histocompatibility complex class I molecule expressed in the extravillous cytotrophoblast at the feto-maternal interface, is known to protect the fetus from maternal cellular immunity. In a preliminary study, we showed that HLA-G is expressed in the hearts of some patients after heart transplantation. In the present study, a larger number of patients was investigated to confirm this finding and to look for possible correlations between HLA-G expression and the number and types of rejection. Expression of HLA-G in endomyocardial biopsy specimens was investigated by immunohistochemical analysis, and detection of the soluble HLA-G in the serum was performed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis. HLA-G was detected in the biopsy specimens and serum of 9 of 51 patients (18%). The number of episodes of acute rejection was significantly lower in HLA-G-positive patients (1.2+/-1.1) as compared with HLA-G-negative patients (4.5+/-2.8) (P<0.001). No chronic rejection was observed in HLA-G-positive patients, whereas 15 HLA-G-negative patients had chronic rejection (P<0.032). A longitudinal study of these patients reveals that the status of HLA-G expression was maintained after 6 months both in serum and in biopsy specimens. During this period, HLA-G-positive patients did not have chronic rejection. There is a significant correlation between rejection and HLA-G expression in the heart after transplantation. HLA-G expression and its effect in reducing the incidence and severity of rejection seem to be stable throughout the evolution.

Myocardial ischemic injury after heart transplantation is associated with subsequent development of graft vasculopathy. Both vitronectin receptor (integrin alpha(v)beta3) and tissue factor play key roles in vascular endothelial cell injury. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are activated in ischemic injury models. Thirteen patients developed myocardial ischemic injury within 2 weeks of cardiac transplantation (ischemia group). These were compared with 10 transplantation patients who had no evidence of ischemia (control group). Endomyocardial biopsies were evaluated within 2 weeks of transplantation for alpha(v)beta3, tissue factor, and extracellular MMP inducer (EMMPRIN). At 1 year, MMPs were evaluated, and interstitial myocardial fibrosis was quantified. All patients underwent intravascular ultrasound at 1 month and 1 year after transplantation. Compared with control, the ischemia group demonstrated evidence of significant increased expression of alpha(v)beta3 (3.2-fold, P<0.001), tissue factor (2.5-fold, P<0.001), and EMMPRIN (1.9-fold, P=0.01).

A congenital heart disease is said intractable when the only options are either heart transplantation or a complex palliative programme including several interventions leading to a mid-term Fontan-type circulation.

Both of these are difficult to operate and have hazardous long term results. This is why prenatal detection of such lesions usually leads to termination of pregnancy. Yet, postnatally, a serious ethical issue emerges, opposing the above-mentioned options to a third way: abstention.

Free radicals and other reactive species generated during reperfusion of ischemic tissues may cause DNA damage and, consequently, the activation of the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). An excessive PARP activation may result in a depletion of intracellular NAD+ and ATP, hence cell suffering and, ultimately, cell death. The present study is aimed at clarifying the role of PARP in a heart transplantation procedure and the contribution of myocyte necrosis and/or apoptosis to this process. In our experimental model, rat heart subjected to heterotopic transplantation, low temperature global ischemia (2 h) was followed by an in vivo reperfusion (30 or 60 min). Under these conditions clear signs of oxidative stress, such as lipoperoxidation and DNA strand breaks, were evident. In addition to a marked activation, accompanied by a significant NAD+ and ATP depletion, PARP protein levels significantly increased after 60 min of reperfusion. Ultrastructural analysis showed nuclear clearings, intracellular oedema and plasma membrane discontinuity. Other relevant observations were the absence of typical signs of apoptosis like caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage, random DNA fragmentation, rise in serum levels of heart damage markers. Our results suggest that during heart transplantation, the activation of PARP, causing energy depletion, results in myocardial cell injury whose dominant feature, at least in our experimental model, is necrosis rather than apoptosis.

Late acute cardiac graft failure carries a high mortality in adults. Vascular mediators and factors other than classic T-cell-mediated rejection may play a role in this process, and aggressive multimodality therapy may improve survival. We report experience with plasmapheresis in treating late severe acute left ventricular dysfunction in a group of pediatric heart transplant recipients. We retrospectively reviewed clinical records, echocardiograms, hemodynamics, coronary angiograms, biopsy specimens, and treatment regimens for 5 patients with 7 episodes of late-onset severe graft failure who recovered. Plasmapheresis was applied in all cases, in addition to methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide, lympholytic agents, and aggressive supportive care including mechanical ventilation and hemofiltration. All patients presented with acute severe left ventricular dysfunction 1.4 to 7.9 years (mean 3.6) after orthotopic heart transplantation. Mean shortening fraction at presentation was 13 to 23% (mean 16), initial endomyocardial biopsy specimens were grade 0 to 3B, and immunofluorescence studies were negative. Treatment included plasmapheresis, cyclophosphamide, mechanical ventilation, hemofiltration, and inotropes. Clinical recovery was slow, with 4 to 8 weeks until left ventricular function normalized, and 2.2 to 9.4 (mean 4.6) weeks to hospital discharge. At follow-up (50 to 38 months, mean 24), all are alive. Two patients are well, whereas coronary vasculopathy developed in 3.

In vivo, activated T cells can be propagated from endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) samples of cardiac allografts in cultures containing recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2). However, T cells are sometimes not propagated in such cultures, even when rejection is present, and at other times the yield of lymphocytes is too small to allow further studies of these graft-infiltrating cells. The current study investigated the effects of the addition of recombinant interleukin-4 (rIL-4) to the culture environment. Cultures were performed on 532 consecutive EMB samples from 120 adult and pediatric heart transplant recipients. Each sample was divided into multiple fragments. Half of the fragments were cultured in media containing 30 U/mL of rIL-2 and the remaining half were cultured under identical conditions but with the addition of 200 U/mL of rIL-4. After 14 days, cell counts were performed, the cell phenotypes were assessed by flow cytometry, and donor specificity and cytotoxicity were assessed using the primed lymphocyte test (PLT) and cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) assay, respectively. Lymphocyte growth occurred in 18% of grade 0-1a EMB in the presence of rIL-2 and in 29% of grade 0-1a EMB in the presence of rIL-2/rIL-4 (p = 0.02). For higher-grade EMB (equivalent to grade >or=1b), the proportion of positive cultures (approximately 39%) was similar in both conditions. For positive cultures, there was a 5-fold increase in the number of cells in the rIL-2/4 cultures compared to rIL-2 alone (1.6 x 10(6) versus 3.4 x 10(5)). Flow cytometry revealed an increase in the proportion of CD8+ cells in the rIL-2/4 cultures (42% versus 23%, p = 0.004). Proliferative responses to donor antigens (as assessed by using the PLT) were comparable between the two groups, but donor-specific cell-mediated cytotoxicity was enhanced on addition of rIL-4. Hence, addition of rIL-4 enhances the propagation of donor-specific T cells from heart biopsy samples, especially in the presence of minimal rejection.

We draw upon these cases to discuss etiologic considerations for sarcoidosis, and suggest that donor-acquired sarcoidosis strengthens the view that sarcoidosis is caused by a transmissible agent, perhaps of infectious origin. Since not all recipients of organs from donors with active sarcoidosis develop sarcoidosis, host factors also appear to be important in disease pathogenesis.

This review outlines that at low concentrations, exogenously administered CO is a molecule involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response in a variety of disease models. CO has been shown to modulate such cellular functions as cytokine production, cell proliferation and apoptosis, protecting the lungs and hearts of rodents from such stressors as endotoxin, ischemia/reperfusion injury, cardiac xenograft rejection, and asthma. Although the mechanism by which this simple diatomic gas provides this protection remains obscure, the conclusions are the same: CO at low concentrations, concentrations that are well below those that would otherwise create toxic effects, is proving beneficial in models of acute injury.

Peak exercise cardiac power and stroke work are invasive parameters with recently proven prognostic value. It is unclear whether these variables have better prognostic value than peak oxygen uptake (VO(2)). The study population comprised 175 patients with chronic heart failure (ejection fraction <45%) who underwent a cardiopulmonary exercise test.

Prognostic value was assessed by survival curves (Kaplan-Meier method) and uni- and multivariate Cox analyses.
