{"text": "ACE inhibitor dosage at the time of listing predicts survival. To be listed for heart transplantation (HTx), optimization of the dosage of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) -inhibitors is recommended worldwide even though this issue has not been thoroughly investigated in the pre-transplantation cohort. The aim of this database study was to analyze the prognostic impact of a pre-defined high vs a low ACE inhibitor dose range at the time of listing for elective HTx in addition to various previously established prognostic factors. Medical records from 237 patients (84% male, mean age 54 years) admitted between January 1995 and January 1998 from 25 different centers in Austria were reviewed. Forty-seven percent were taking > or =75 mg captopril, > or =20 mg enalapril, > or =20 mg lisinopril or > or =5 mg ramipril daily (\"high-dose\" group) and 53% received smaller doses (\"low-dose\" group). No significant differences between groups were detected at baseline except that patients with higher ACE inhibitor doses were more likely to take nitrates, beta-blockers and amiodarone, received higher furosemide doses and had higher serum gamma-glutamyl transferase levels. Follow-up was 328 days (248 SD) with 16% deaths in the \"high-dose\" group vs 288 days (270 SD) with 25% deaths in the \"low-dose\" group. Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated a significant difference over time between the two treatment groups (P = 0.03). Furthermore, dichotomized ACE inhibitor treatment at the time of listing was the strongest independent single predictor of mortality (P = 0.01) with only blood pressure (P = 0.02), alanine transaminase (P = 0.02) and left ventricular end diastolic diameter (P = 0.02) providing additional prognostic information. To explain these findings several factors have to be considered a) greater benefit with higher ACE inhibitor doses b) sicker patients receiving lower ACE inhibitor doses and c) more experienced heart failure care of the \"high-dose\" group. Heart transplantation candidates who, for whatever reason, receive ACE-inhibitors below the recommended dosages, are at increased mortality risk and thus merit greater scrutiny.

Donor chimerism (the presence of donor cells of bone marrow origin) is present for years after transplantation in recipients of solid organs. In lung recipients, chimerism is associated with a lower incidence of chronic rejection. To augment donor chimerism with the aim to enhance graft acceptance and to reduce immunosuppression, we initiated a trial combining infusion of donor bone marrow with heart transplantation. Reported herein are the intermediate-term results of this ongoing trial. Between September 1993 and August 1998, 28 patients received concurrent heart transplantation and infusion of donor bone marrow at 3.0 x 10(8) cells/kg (study group). Twenty-four contemporaneous heart recipients who did not receive bone marrow served as controls. All patients received an immunosuppressive regimen consisting of tacrolimus and steroids. Patient survival was similar between the study and control groups (86% and 87% at 3 years, respectively). However, the proportion of patients free from grade 3A rejection was higher in the study group (64% at 6 months) than in the control group (40%; P =.03). The prevalence of coronary artery disease was similar between the two groups (freedom from disease at 3 years was 78% in study patients and 69% in controls). Similar proportions of study (18%) and control (15%) patients exhibited in vitro evidence of donor-specific hyporesponsiveness. The infusion of donor bone marrow reduces the rate of acute rejection in heart recipients. Donor bone marrow may play an important role in strategies aiming to enhance the graft acceptance.

Due to the limited number of donor organs, death on the waiting list and waiting time for cardiac transplantation have markedly increased. A pressing need of appropriate selection criteria for patients who would benefit most from transplantation is apparent. The purpose of this study is to identify pre- and early postoperative risk factors that influence long term survival after cardiac transplantation. 702 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac transplantation between 3/1984 and 12/1997 were analyzed retrospectively for the influence of different pre- and early postoperative risk factors on early (30 days) and late death (5 years). Univariate and multivariate regression analysis revealed risk factors for early as well as late death. Predictors of early death were higher preoperative PVR, retransplantation, longer ischemic time, postoperative acute kidney failure and longer intubation time. Risk factors for late death were early transplant era, previous cardiac surgery, patients awaiting transplantation in a hospital, prolonged stay in an intensive care unit, and any rejection during the first month after transplantation. These results demonstrate that pre- and early postoperative risk factors have significant influence on early and long term survival.

The study examines the prevalence of tricuspid regurgitation and biopsy-induced flail tricuspid leaflets after orthotopic heart transplantation and evaluates the results of the tricuspid valve surgery. By a computerized search of the databases 647 of 889 patients who survived heart transplantation for more than 30 days were identified for this study. The primary tool for rejection monitoring in our institution is the daily observation of intramyocardial ECG (IMEG) based on day-by-day changes of the maximal QRS complex amplitude. Endomyocardial biopsy with 45-cm-long sheath bioptome was performed only in doubtful IMEG and echocardiographic data and at times of annual routine heart catheterization. Tricuspid regurgitation was diagnosed clinically and by echocardiography as mild, moderate and severe. Eleven patients received prosthetic valve replacements (four bioprostheses and seven mechanical valves) and six patients underwent valve reconstruction. The choice of xenograft valve was dictated by the condition of renal function. Patient survival and incidence of tricuspid regurgitation and freedom from operation for severe tricuspid regurgitation were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier method. The prevalence of tricuspid regurgitation was 20.1%. Mild and moderate tricuspid regurgitation was seen in 14.5 and 3.1% of the patients, respectively, who were responsive to medical therapy and remained clinically stable in NYHA class I-II. Severe tricuspid regurgitation was seen in 16 (2.5%) patients who presented signs of an acute right heart dysfunction. Tricuspid valve pathology at operation revealed biopsy-induced rupture of the Chordae tendineae at various valve segments mostly the anterior and posterior leaflets. There was one hospital death (<30 day) and five late deaths due to infection, arrhythmia and trauma and no procedural-related or directly cardiac related death. Ten patients (62.5%) are alive at a mean follow-up time of 29.9 months (range 4-81 months) and nine survivors are in NYHA class I-II and one in class III. Severe tricuspid regurgitation in transplanted hearts is associated mainly with biopsy-induced injury or endocarditis. Other regimes of rejection monitoring may help to eliminate this complication. Apart from our preference of valve repair, the choice of valve substitute may be influenced by the presence or the prospect of chronic renal failure. Heart transplant patients can safely undergo valve surgery with acceptable mortality, low morbidity and excellent intermediate-term clinical results. Mild to moderate functional tricuspid regurgitation is responsive to medical therapy and non-progressive and occur in 17.6% of orthotopic transplanted hearts without having a detrimental effect on the right ventricular performance.

This subgroup of patients was compared to 109 control patients who underwent cardiac transplantation as the primary cardiac procedure (group B). Patient groups were analysed regarding their preoperative, intra-operative, and postoperative variables in addition to survival. Pre-operative events were comparable in both groups but the duration of the operation was longer for group A (311+/-68 min) compared to group B (202+/-34 min); P=0.02. Post-operative exploration for bleeding was 6/49 patients in group A compared to 2/107 patients in group B (P=0.02).

Flow cytometry crossmatching (FCXM) is more sensitive than the cytotoxic crossmatch in identifying preformed antibodies to donor alloantigens, but its clinical importance is controversial. The objective of this study was to determine the association of a FCXM with survival and incidence of vascular rejection in cardiac transplant recipients with a negative cytotoxic crossmatch. Between 1993 and 1998, 357 heart transplant recipients with a negative T cell cytotoxic crossmatch were studied by three-color FCXM to quantitate anti-donor IgG reactions against B and T lymphocytes. Reactions positive against both were consistent with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class I reactivity, and those against B cells only were considered to be against HLA Class II antigens. Endpoints were episodes of vascular rejection, death from acute and chronic rejection and overall survival. Fifty patients were FCXM for Class I-positive, 144 for Class II-positive, and 163 were negative. At 1 month, freedom from vascular rejection was 64% in Class I patients, but 90% and 96% in Class II or negative crossmatch patients (P<0.0001). Survival of the negative crossmatch group was higher than either Class I or II groups (94%, 74% and 76%, respectively, at 3 years; P<0.0001).

Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressive agent that is gaining widespread use in solid organ transplantation. This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of tacrolimus in treating steroid-resistant cellular myocardial rejection. We retrospectively analyzed the incidence of rejection and clinical outcome of 21 heart transplant recipients who were electively converted from cyclosporine to tacrolimus for recurrent episodes of steroid-resistant cellular rejection. These were compared to a historic group of 6 hemodynamically stable patients who were treated electively with Orthoclone OKT3 (Muromonab/CD3) for recurrent rejection. Eighty five percent (56/66) of the episodes of rejection occurred within the first 3 months after heart transplantation. Tacrolimus was started 2. 4 +/- 2.0 months post-transplant, and the mean follow-up duration on tacrolimus was 11.0 +/- 7.0 months. After conversion, a significant decline was noted in both the number of episodes of acute rejection per patient (3.14 +/- 0.85-0.57 +/- 0.87, p < 0.0001), and the incidence of acute rejection per 100 patient-days (6.39 +/- 3.96-0. 25 +/- 0.47, p < 0.0001).

The average hospital charges per patient for the OKT3-treated group was $33,339 +/- $10,511. There was no significant difference in the actuarial 1-year survival between the tacrolimus and OKT3-treated groups (93% vs 80%, p = 0.5). Outpatient conversion to tacrolimus is safe, well tolerated, and an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of steroid-resistant cellular rejection in heart transplant recipients.

This study analyzed the relationship of variability in routine trough cyclosporine (CSA) levels to morbidity after pediatric cardiac transplantation. Due to high interindividual variation between dosage and blood concentrations, trough surveillance CSA levels are routinely performed after cardiac transplantation to adjust dosages. In addition, trough CSA levels have been used as a measure of patient compliance in transplant recipients. Recent investigations have demonstrated a relationship between late rejection and mistimed CSA dosing intervals, which could also lead to CSA levels that are incorrectly presumed to be trough levels. Trough surveillance whole-blood CSA levels were retrospectively reviewed in 49 pediatric heart transplant recipients who had a median follow-up of 42 months (range 6 to 138 months). All patients received the same immunosuppression regimen (CSA, azathioprine, and steroids), the same CSA-level surveillance protocol, and the same stabilization of CSA dose and level in the therapeutic range (150 to 300 ng/ml) prior to hospital discharge. CSA levels drawn because of coexisting phenomena (drug interaction, gastroenteritis) that could cause CSA-level fluctuation were excluded from analysis. Cyclosporine variability was measured as the percentage of CSA levels that were considered sub-therapeutic (< or = 100 ng/ml), toxic (> or = 450 ng/ml), or both. Cyclosporine-level variability was then analyzed in respect to demographic and outcome variables. For the group, the median percentage of sub-therapeutic levels was 3% (range, 0% to 16%); the median percentage of toxic levels was 5% (range, 0% to 36%); the median of the combination of sub-therapeutic and toxic levels was 10% (0% to 38%). Eight of the 49 patients (16%) has a high (>20%) percentage of sub-therapeutic + toxic levels or high CSA variability. High CSA variability was significantly associated with recipients > 12 months of age (p = 0.028), and recipients with a history of non-compliance (p < 0.001). Patients with high CSA variability had a significantly higher median number of hospitalized days per year of follow-up (p = 0.036), higher rate of recurrent rejection (> or = 2 episodes; p = 0.0003), and higher death rate more than 6 months after transplant (p = 0.01).

Early and long-term survival was significantly decreased in critically ill patients with pre-operative mechanical assistance compared with other patients without pre-operative assistance.

Questionnaires were sent to 130 cardiac transplant centers in the United States registered with the United Network for Organ Sharing. Data collected included patient demographics; type, stage, and timing of HD/NHL; treatment for HD/NHL; posttransplant immunosuppressive regimen, rejection history, and outcomes; and Epstein-Barr virus status. Thirty-four cardiac transplant recipients with a previous history of HD (n=16) or NHL (n=18) were identified.

The short tolerable cold ischemia time and the importance of other risk factors have generally superseded the role of HLA matching in the allocation of donor hearts. Recent advances in the accuracy and time required to perform HLA typing and crossmatching, however, have led us to re-examine the United Network of Organ Sharing Transplant Registry for the effects of the HLA incompatibility on outcome in relation to other possible risk factors. These include conventional HLA-A, -B, and cross-reactive group (CREG) mismatching (mm), HLA-DR mm, pretransplantation panel-reactive antibody (PRA), recipient and donor race and donor age, cold ischemia time, and the pretransplantation use of either a left ventricular assist device or an intra-aortic balloon pump. Three-year survival was clearly inferior in non-white (0.6921) as compared with white (0.7632) recipients, but this difference could not be accounted for by the degree of donor-recipient HLA mm that had occurred by chance. Nevertheless, the degree of mm that did occur seemed to have an impact on survival. The importance of HLA-DR mm was confirmed, and it ranked only behind the use of an assist device and recipient race in the multivariate analysis. HLA-A and B mm exerted an additional effect, but this was only true in white recipients. Of these, HLA-A achieved statistical significance as an independent risk factor. In general, CREG mm was not a significant variable. However, more than twice as many 0-1 or 0-2 CREG, 0 DR mm as compared with 0-1 or 0-2 A,B, 0 DR mm transplants enjoyed approximately equal and very good 1- and 3-year survival. Assuming no change is cold ischemia time, the potential number of 0 CREG, 0 DR mm, ABO-compatible transplants that could be achieved when an Organ Procurement Organization had 50-100 patients on their waiting list was calculated. The surprisingly high frequency of approximately 24-36% suggests that this favorable match could be considered along with other important factors in the local allocation process. When pretransplantation PRA was analyzed as a continuous variable from 0 to 100%, it was a highly significant risk factor, but this effect was more strikingly evident when the PRA was analyzed in 20% increments above zero. Recently, left ventricular assist device usage has become increasingly common, and it has been associated with strikingly increased pretransplantation PRA levels. When they occur together, the data indicates that these patients are at a very high risk for graft failure.

Heart transplantation has been established as therapy in patients with terminal heart failure who remain severely symptomatic (NYHA III-IV) despite optimal drug therapy and surgical interventions other than transplantation.

Of these, peak oxygen consumption below 12-14 ml/kg/min, no irreversibly elevated pulmonary resistance, and no major concomitant disease are most important. However, conventional therapy of advanced heart failure has considerably improved over the last decade. Thus, heart transplantation may be avoided or at least postponed in many patients. Nevertheless, continuous treatment at a heart failure/heart transplantation clinic in collaboration with the general practitioner is essential in these patients. This may allow to closely monitor these severely ill patients and to select the optimal point of time for transplantation.

Lipid levels, safety, and post-transplant outcomes were compared. We found no significant differences in total LDL or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, linearized infection or rejection rates, liver function tests, or immunosuppressant dosages between groups at 1, 3, 6, or 12 months. Rhabdomyolysis or myositis occurred only in patients on simvastatin (n = 6, 13.3%) with no episodes for patients on pravastatin (p = 0. 032). Survival at 12 months on an actual treatment basis was 97.6% for patients on pravastatin and 83.7% for those on simvastatin (p = 0.078). Immunosuppression-related deaths occurred in only 2.4% (1 patient) on pravastatin vs 15.6% (n = 7) on simvastatin (p = 0.06). Pravastatin and simvastatin resulted in comparable lipid profiles. Pravastatin use was however free from the high rates of rhabdomyolysis and myositis seen with simvastatin use. Pravastatin was additionally associated with a trend toward superior survival, attributable to fewer immunosuppression-related deaths. For safety and pharmacokinetic reasons, pravastatin should be considered the statin of choice after heart transplantation.

Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly being used to \"bridge\" patients to heart transplantation. Data from 40 consecutive status 1 heart transplantation patients treated with intravenous inotrope therapy (n = 20) or the HeartMate LVAD (n = 20) were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline clinical characteristics were similar in the two groups. At the time of transplantation, LVAD patients had significantly higher blood pressure and sodium with significantly lower blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. After transplantation, renal failure (52.6% versus 16.7%) and right heart failure (31.6% versus 5.6%) occurred more frequently (p < 0.05) in the inotrope group. Six-month survival after transplantation did not significantly differ in the inotrope or LVAD groups (73.7% versus 88.9%) but event-free survival was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in the inotrope group (15.8% versus 55.6%). Total hospital charges were significantly lower in the inotrope group ($213,860 +/- $107,560 versus $342,620 +/- $104,420), but average daily hospital charges were not different ($3,990 +/- $1,300 versus $4,130 +/- $2,050).

Previous studies have not provided a definite clarification for the predictive value of pretransplant renal indices on postcardiac transplant patient outcome. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between pretransplant renal function and recovery after heart transplantation. The study group consisted of 199 consecutive patients who underwent heart transplantation between 1973 and 1994. For better comparison, patients were arbitrarily divided into three different groups based on the year of the transplant operation: Group I- before 1985 (n=13), Group II- between 1985 and 1989 (n=68) and Group III- between 1990 and 1994 (n=118). Values for serum creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urea/creatinine ratio (U/Cr), creatinine clearance (Cr(cl)), length of hospital stay (LOS), early (30-day) mortality, and survival at 1-year and at 5-year were collected for each patient. The data was analyzed by the use of univariate log-rank test with forward stepwise procedure. Postcardiac transplant LOS in the hospital or survival was unaffected by the pretransplant renal indices except the U/Cr ratio (p>0.05). When adjusted for the time, the U/Cr ratio was also insignificant (p=0.1349). The use of hemodialysis was necessary in 9 patients (4.5%) for treatment of acute renal failure manifested immediately after the transplant operation. Early mortality was 44% for these 9 cardiac transplant recipients who required the use of hemodialysis: 0% (0/3) in the 1985-1989 period and 67% (4/6) in the 1990-1994 period.

Panel reactive antibodies at the time of transplant were assayed and used as a marker for sensitization if more than 10%. Sensitized recipients had a poorer 1-year survival than those not sensitized (76 vs. 89%, respectively, P=0.2). Donor cause of death had an overall significant impact on survival with 1-year survival for recipients of trauma organs of 92 and 82% for recipients of nontrauma hearts (P=0.02).

Knowledge regarding diagnosis, morbidity and prognosis is limited. Echocardiographic criteria for IVNC include-in the absence of significant heart lesions-segmental thickening of the left ventricular myocardial wall consisting of two layers: a thin, compacted epicardial and an extremely thickened endocardial layer with prominent trabeculations and deep recesses.

Heart transplantation (HT) provides longer survival than that of the natural history in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the optimal timing for cardiac transplantation and predictors of mortality in patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy (ESCM) has been poorly defined. The primary purpose of this study focused on the natural history of ambulatory patients with ESCM for HT assessment. Secondly, we tried to determine prognostic factors of individuals with the poorest short-term outcome and the optimal timing for HT in patients with ESCM. Finally, clinical treatment with angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), carvedilol and amiodarone in the prevention of mortality caused by ESCM, were retrospectively evaluated. The short-term outcomes of 119 referral patients with ESCM for four years were observed. The patients had New York Heart Association class III to IV dyspnea at initial assessment for HT. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 17 +/- 6% and cardiac index (CI) was 2.0 +/- 0.6l/min/m2. After optimization of medical treatment, the patients were divided into two major groups according to CI equal to or less than 2.0l/min/m2 and more than 2.0l/min/m2. HTs were accepted in 88 patients and the patients were divided into two groups: medical treatment (group 1, 56 patients) or HT (group 3, 32 patients); HT was not accepted in the other 31 patients (group 2). We studied the probability of the survival curve and prognostic variables of the groups with medical treatment in the follow-up of 12 +/- 9 months. During follow-up, 49 patients were alive without HT. The remaining 38 patients died; 27 patients were in group 1 and 11 patients were in group 2. Eight deaths in group 2 were sudden.

Treatment with amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia (VT) showed no convincing role in the prevention of sudden death in our patients. Also, treatment with ACEIs or carvedilol for heart failure was unconvincing to improve the short-term outcome in this study. Our results suggest in properly selected patients that HT should be considered within six months among patients with severe heart failure. Hemodynamic parameters associated with right cardiac function are important determinants of mortality caused by progressive heart failure.

Numerous studies indicate that CD4 T cells are required for acute cardiac allograft rejection. However, the precise role for CD4 T cells in this response has remained ambiguous owing to the multipotential properties of this T-cell subpopulation. In the current study, we demonstrate the capacity of CD4 T cells to serve as direct effector cells of cardiac allograft rejection. We show that CD4 T cells are both necessary and sufficient for acute graft rejection, as indicated by adoptive transfer experiments in immune-deficient SCID and rag1(-/-) recipients. We have analyzed the contribution of direct (donor MHC class II restricted) and indirect (host MHC class II restricted) antigen recognition in CD4-mediated rejection. Acute CD4 T cell-mediated rejection required MHC class II expression by the allograft, indicating the importance of direct graft recognition. In contrast, reciprocal experiments indicate that CD4 T cells can acutely reject allogeneic cardiac allografts established in rag1(-/-) hosts that were also MHC class II deficient. This latter result indicates that indirect presentation of donor antigens by host MHC class II is not required for acute CD4-mediated rejection. Taken together, these results indicate that CD4 T cells can serve as effector cells for primary acute cardiac allograft rejection, predominantly via direct donor antigen recognition and independent of indirect reactivity.

HBV was transmitted nosocomially from patient to patient, most likely during endomyocardial biopsies. HCV was mainly transmitted through blood transfusions or the transplanted organ. Clinical and biological findings after 2 years of follow-up showed that 3 patients with an HBV genotype A precore mutant had severe or subfulminant hepatitis and that patients with HBV and HCV infection always progressed to chronicity. In general, patients had mild alanine aminotransferase level increases, a high level of viral replication, and few severe histologic lesions, except for patients infected by precore HBV mutants. Patients coinfected by HBV and HCV tended to have more severe liver lesions.

Inflammation may be involved in the origin of transplant coronary artery disease. We hypothesized that plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), markers for systemic inflammation, would correlate with cardiac transplant graft survival. We studied 99 consecutive cardiac transplant recipients who were referred for routine endomyocardial biopsy and/or surveillance coronary angiography. Plasma levels of CRP and IL-6 were measured by their respective ELISAs. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those who died or required retransplantation and those who survived without the need for retransplantation. During the follow-up period of 5.0+/-2.7 years (range, 0.2 to 15.1 years) after transplant, 20 patients died and 9 required retransplantation. There was no significant difference in age, race, sex, cause of native myopathy, presence of diabetes, or use of aspirin, statins, or calcium channel blockers between the 2 groups. Although IL-6 did not relate to graft failure, CRP level was predictive of allograft failure (P:=0.003). The risk of allograft failure increased 36% for every 2-fold increase in CRP level. Moreover, CRP levels also correlated significantly with the frequency of grade 3 rejection (P:=0.02). In multivariate analysis, when combined with other significant predictors such as donor age and sex mismatching of the graft, CRP still significantly predicted graft failure (P:=0.025) with a 32% increase in the risk of graft failure for every 2-fold increase in CRP level.

A total of 103 cardiac transplant candidates were assessed with the MBHI as part of a pretransplant evaluation that included baseline demographic variables and cardiac status. Time to transplant and mortality status at 1 and 5 years was also obtained. Cluster analysis of MBHI response scores elicited two clusters characterized by high and low distress. Cluster membership predicted survival status at 1-year and 5-year follow-up, with high distress cluster patients having significantly higher mortality in both the total sample and a subgroup of patients who did receive a heart transplant. These results support the value of the MBHI for assessing personality attributes that may dispose toward unfavorable outcome in heart transplant candidates. Further understanding of psychosocial contributions to illness course and outcome may enable more effective selection of treatment interventions with cardiac patients.

The induction of immune hyporesponsiveness in transplantation is a complex interaction between the immune system and the alloantigen. The route by which an antigen is introduced to the immune system plays an important role in the immune response. Antigen delivered via the portal circulation has the ability to induce T-cell hyporesponsiveness. In this study we examined the mechanism responsible for the induction of hyporesponsiveness by assessing immune response following portal vein (pv) injection of donor alloantigen. C57B1/6 mice were immunized via pv with splenic mononuclear cells (SMNC) from BALB/c mice. The recipient immune response was assessed in vivo by murine heterotopic heart transplant survival. SMNC and hepatic nonparenchymal cells (NPC) were isolated from pv immunized animals and used as regulatory cells in a one-way mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) as a measure of in vitro recipient responder SMNC proliferation. Survival of murine heterotopic heart transplants was prolonged following pv injection of alloantigen (p < .04 compared to nonimmunized or systemically immunized mice). Stimulation of responder SMNCs isolated from pv immunized mice resulted in an antigen-specific hyporesponsiveness (p < .05 compared with nonimmunized or systemically immunized mice). Cocultures of responder SMNCs from nonimmunized (naive) mice with hepatic NPC from previously pv immunized mice resulted in attenuation of T-cell proliferation in MLR following stimulation with donor alloantigen (p < .05 compared to coculture with NPC from nonimmunized mice or SMNC from pv immunized mice). These data would suggest that the hepatic NPC plays an important role in the regulation of the immune response. With further identification of cell subtypes responsible for induction of hyporesponsiveness, future therapies may be directed at these specific targets, thereby minimizing the harmful side effects of current immunosuppressive therapies.

Data from 847 patients transplanted between 1/1/93 and 12/31/98 at 18 centers in the Pediatric Heart Transplant Study were analyzed. Rejection with severe hemodynamic compromise was defined as a clinical event occurring beyond 1 week postoperatively, which led to augmentation of immunosuppression and use of inotropic therapy. Actuarial freedom from such rejection and death after rejection were determined and risk factors sought. Among 1,033 rejection episodes in 532 patients, 113 (11%) episodes were associated with severe hemodynamic compromise in 95 patients. The highest risk for severe rejection was in the first year. Risk factors were older recipient age (p >.05) and non-white race (p >.001). Survival after an episode was poor (60%), and biopsy score did not affect outcome. Deaths were due to rejection (n = 14), other cardiac causes (n = 17), infection (n = 5), lymphoma (n = 2), pulmonary causes (n = 2), and thrombosis (n = 1). Rejection with severe hemodynamic compromise occurs in 11% of pediatric patients, irrespective of age, sex or biopsy score, and mortality is high. Non-white race and older recipient age are independent risk factors for rejection with severe hemodynamic compromise. Aggressive treatment and close surveillance should be crucial components of protocols aimed at reducing the high mortality.

Patients surviving into adulthood with congenital heart disease (CHD) often succumb to progressive cardiopulmonary dysfunction. For these patients transplantation is often considered. We performed a retrospective review of 69 adults (age >18 years) with CHD transplanted between 1984 and 1999. We evaluated 31 heart-lung (HLTxp), 30 lung (LTxp), and 8 heart (HTxp) transplants performed in 22 men and 47 women with CHD. Mean age was 37 +/- 10 years with a mean follow-up of 3.1 +/- 3.5 years. A concomitant cardiovascular procedure was performed in 1 HLTxp, 23 LTxp, and 2 HTxp. Early mortality (>30 days) was 26% (8/31) for HLTxp, mostly due to bleeding. Early LTxp mortality was 23% (7/30), largely due to graft failure. One and 3-year survival was similar in adults transplanted for CHD and adults transplanted for other disease. Early mortality among HTxp recipients was 50% (4/8) from rejection or technical complications. Survival for patients undergoing HLTxp versus LTxp with cardiac repair was similar. When examined by era, the survival of patients transplanted for CHD between 1992 and 1999 was greater than that of patients transplanted between 1984 and 1991. Adults undergoing HLTxp and LTxp for CHD can expect survival comparable to that of non-CHD adults. In the presence of a reparable cardiac lesion, LTxp with cardiovascular repair for CHD is an attractive option, optimizing organ allocation. Specific technical concerns are discussed. Survival of adults undergoing cardiopulmonary transplantation for CHD has improved over time.

Cardiac allograft left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is an important measure of left ventricular systolic function. Despite widespread use of LVEF after transplantation, its normal range and prognostic value in cardiac allografts has not been defined. We conducted a retrospective cohort study among 292 consecutive adult heart transplant patients. Left ventricular ejection fractions were performed at 1, 3, 12, 24, and 48 months after transplantation using radionuclide ventriculography. Endomyocardial biopsies assessed rejection, right heart catheterization assessed loading conditions, and angiography assessed allograft coronary artery disease. We used Cox proportional hazards model to examine the predictive value of LVEF on late mortality. Of the patients who survived > or =4 years, the mean allograft LVEF decreased 4.7 units at 3 months, from 63.8 to 59.7; an additional 4.1 units at 12 months, from 59.7 to 55.6 (p < 0.001); and remained stable afterward. These changes were not associated with concurrent changes in loading conditions, episodes of rejection, or development of allograft coronary artery disease.

Although the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has been increasingly used as a bridge to transplant, its effect on post-transplant outcome is uncertain. We, therefore, designed this study using the Cardiac Transplant Research Database to compare patients supported on an LVAD before transplant with those treated with intravenous inotropic medical therapy. Of the 5,880 patients transplanted between 1990 and 1997, a total of 502 received support from LVADs and 2,514 received intravenous inotropic medical therapy at the time of transplant. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no significant difference in post-transplant survival between the LVAD and medical-therapy groups (p = 0.09). Results of a multivariate Cox regression analysis were consistent with that of the Kaplan-Meier analysis and did not identify LVAD as a significant risk factor for mortality. The percentage of patients who received LVADs as a function of total transplants increased from 2% in 1990 to 16% in 1997. Furthermore, although the number of extracorporeal LVADs remained relatively constant, the number of intracorporeal LVADs increased over time. Multivariate parametric analysis found that the risk factors for post-transplant death in the LVAD group were extracorporeal LVAD use (p = 0.0004), elevated serum creatinine (p = 0.05), older donor age (p = 0.03), increased donor ischemic time (p < 0.0001), and earlier year of transplant (p = 0.03). Given a limited donor supply, the intracorporeal LVAD helps the sickest patients survive to transplant and provides post-transplant outcome similar to that of patients supported on inotropic medical therapy.

Although the concept of reducing wall tension a treatment for advanced heart failure is convincing, clinical data from the Batista operation are conflicting. Despite a number of publications, it is not clear whether left ventricular reduction surgery truly benefits patients with idiopathic, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Surgery may reduce wall tension, but the reason for dilation and contractile dysfunction remains. Thus, the potential benefit of the operation may be overshadowed by the natural course of the underlying disease. We report a series of five cases where left ventricular reduction was performed and physiological geometry was restored in patients with DCM by a modification of Dor's endoventricular patch plasty. All patients demonstrated an improvement in cardiac function immediately after the operation. This improvement was sustained in one of the patients after 18 months of follow-up. Another patient developed severe heart failure due to therapy-resistant ventricular arrhythmia (Lown IV b), and underwent successful transplantation 4 months after ventricular reduction surgery. Left ventricular dilation reoccurred in two patients 9 and 12 months after reduction surgery, and they were listed for transplant. One patient died after 9 weeks due to sepsis and respiratory dysfunction. Although the endoventricular patch plasty, as used in this study, is well tolerated by most patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and results in immediate improvement of contractile function, the long-term benefits of this technique for DCM are uncertain. Thus, the technique is currently not an alternative for heart transplantation. However, the procedure may be an option in patients with contraindications for transplantation.

Since the first human heart transplantation was performed in 1967, the field of heart transplantation has advanced to the point where survival and acceptable quality of life are commonplace. Despite remarkable progress in the clinical management of rejection, rejection continues to limit survival and quality of life in the heart transplant population. This review will discuss the biologic processes involved in hyperacute rejection, acute rejection, and humoral (vascular) rejection. The development of endomyocardial biopsy techniques represented a significant advancement in the diagnosis of cardiac rejection, and endomyocardial biopsy remains the 'gold standard' in the diagnosis of cellular rejection. To date, no noninvasive parameters will diagnose rejection with adequate sensitivity and specificity. Biopsy frequency and immunosuppressive therapies may be tailored to the risk of rejection. Immunosuppression for cardiac transplantation can be divided into three major phases: 1) perioperative immunosuppression; 2) maintenance immunosuppression, and; 3) treatment of rejection. The strategy for treating transplant rejection should be influenced by several variables: 1) Histologic grade of rejection; 2) Evidence of hemodynamic compromise by ejection fraction or right heart catheterization; 3) Severity of previous rejection episodes and types of immunosuppressives used; and 4) Risk factors for rejection, including time after transplantation. Future rejection therapy will involve more sophisticated attempts to alter host responses toward the donor organ in a more specific and selective way. Despite considerable advances in the care of the heart transplant recipient, long-term survival is limited by cardiac allograft vasculopathy.

Infection was the most common cause of death in the first 3 months after transplantation. Allograft vasculopathy was the main cause of death in the group of patients surviving the first year. Malignancy was another cause of late mortality. Clinically relevant non-fatal infections occurred in 35.4% of our patients.

We describe a modified technique of rat HHT in the neck, using a cuff method that can be mastered by beginners within a few weeks. Our main modification of the rat HHT in the neck is that the right superior vena cava of the graft is chosen as an outflow duct, while the pulmonary artery has been taken as an effluent drainage in the ordinary HHT models. The aorta of the donor is anastomosed with the carotid artery of the recipient. Donation can be completed within 5 min and vascular connections in the recipient done within 3 min, resulting in a minimum of ischemia time. Using this minimum surgical intervention model, we tested the immunosuppressive effect of a sublethal dose of methotrexate (MTX), which has been widely used in cancer therapy. Our results showed that high doses of MTX severely suppressed the recipient bone marrow, but prolonged heart allografts for more than 365 days after HHT. In conclusion, the new model simplified the rat HHT procedure and made it possible for the beginner of rodent transplantation to master this skill within a few weeks.

Of these, 68 cachectic (body mass index [BMI]<20 kg/m2), 113 overweight (BMI=>27-30 kg/m2), and 55 morbidly obese (BMI>30 kg/m2) patients were compared with 238 normal-weight recipients (BMI=20-27 kg/m2). We evaluated the influence of pretransplant BMI on morbidity and mortality after cardiac transplantation. Kaplan-Meier survival distribution and Cox proportional hazards model were used for statistical analyses. Morbidly obese as well as cachectic recipients demonstrated nearly twice the 5-year mortality of normal-weight or overweight recipients (53% vs. 27%, respectively, P=0.001). An increase in mortality was seen at 30 days for morbidly obese and cachectic recipients (12.7% and 17.7%, respectively) versus a 30-day mortality rate of 7.6% in normal-weight recipients. Morbidly obese recipients experienced a shorter time to high-grade acute rejection (P=0.004) as well as an increased annual high-grade rejection frequency when compared with normal-weight recipients (P=0.001). By multivariable analysis, the incidence of transplant-related coronary artery disease (TCAD) was not increased in morbidly obese patients but cachectic patients had a significantly lower incidence of TCAD (P=0.05). Cachectic patients receiving oversized donor hearts had a significantly higher postoperative mortality (P=0.02). The risks of cardiac transplantation are increased in both morbidly obese and cachectic patients compared with normal-weight recipients. However, the results of cardiac transplantation in overweight patients is comparable to that in normal-weight patients. Recipient size should be kept in mind while selecting patients and the use of oversized donors in cachectic recipients should be avoided.

The superiority of different induction therapies after heart-lung and lung transplantation is not clearly established; specifically, whether monoclonal (OKT3) or polyclonal antibody induction therapy provides any advantage. Between 1989 and 1991 we used induction therapy with either rabbit antithymocyte globulin (RATG) or OKT3, given at random based on the availability of RATG. RATG was used in 25 patients (RATG group 1) and OKT3 in 38 patients (OKT3 group 1). Early results suggested a survival advantage with RATG. From 1992 until 1997 we used RATG induction therapy in 108 patients (RATG group 2). This study analyzed longer-term survival, infection, rejection, and obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) rates for RATG group 1 and OKT3 group 1 and assessed outcomes for RATG group 2.

For other thoracic transplants, the most frequently reported indications include cystic fibrosis (35.5%) for double lung, emphysema/COPD (49.7%) for single lung and congenital heart disease (46.6%) for heart-lung. The most frequently reported diagnoses for thoracic transplantation outside the US include cardiomyopathy (43.8%) for heart, cystic fibrosis (33.4%) for double-lung, emphysema/COPD (26.6%) for single-lung and primary pulmonary hypertension (24.8%) for heart-lung transplants. 3. US heart transplant recipients are predominately male (76.7%), between 50 and 64 years of age (51.3%) and white (81.4%). US lung transplant recipients are also predominately between 50 and 64 years of age (44.7%) and white (89.9%), but unlike heart recipients are more likely to be female (51.2%).

Current studies provide evidence that a small G protein, RhoAp21, and its target protein, Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinase (ROCK), regulate not only cell shape but also cell migration. However, contribution of Rho/ROCK signaling to graft rejection is unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory effect of Y-27632, a highly selective ROCK inhibitor, on rejection of heterotopic cardiac transplantation in mice. BALB/c (H-2(d)) hearts were transplanted into C3H/He (H-2(k)) as allografts that were full histoincompatibility combinations. The recipients received several doses of Y-27632, commencing 1 day before cardiac transplantation until rejection. We used immunohistochemical study to detect the expression of myocardial intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and we immunoenzymatically measured serum interleukin (IL)-6. Furthermore, we evaluated cardiac allograft vasculopathy treated with either FK506 or Y-27632 at Day 100. The Y-27632-treated (2 mg/kg/day) allografts prolonged the mean survival time (49.6 +/- 10.1 days, n = 12) as compared with the untreated allografts (8.1 +/- 0.4 days, n = 7, p < 0.001). Histologic examinations of the Y-27632-treated allografts at Day 7 showed greatly reduced leukocyte infiltration compared with the untreated allografts. The Y-27632-treated allografts revealed faint expression of myocardial ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 at Day 7. The serum IL-6 levels also decreased in the Y-27632-treated mice. In the long-surviving Y-27632-treated allografts at Day 100, we saw neither active rejection nor apparent thickening of vascular intima. Our results suggest that ROCK plays a major role in cardiac rejection in the BALB/c-to-C3H/He mouse model.

We describe our experience with 7 patients who were transplanted using organs after fatal carbon monoxide poisoning. A retrospective study of the 1,312 intrathoracic organ transplants between January 1979 and February 2000 was completed. Seven of these transplants (0.5%) were fulfilled with organs retrieved from donors after fatal carbon monoxide poisoning. There were six heart transplants and one single lung transplant. The history of carbon monoxide inhalation was obtained in all of these donors. Five of 6 patients with heart transplant are alive and well with survival ranging from 68 to 1,879 days (mean, 969 +/- 823 days). One patient (a 29-year-old male) died 12 hours posttransplant caused by donor organ failure.

All those recipients who were transplanted from carbon monoxide poisoned donors and ventilated for more than 36 hours, survived for more than 30 days. Moreover, these donors were assessed and optimized by the Papworth donor management protocol. Carbon monoxide poisoned organs can be considered for intrathoracic transplantation. In view of the significant risk of donor organ failure, a cautious approach is still warranted.

The influence of sex on alloreactivity, acute rejection, transplant-related coronary artery disease, and survival was determined. Statistical methods included logistic regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier actuarial survival analysis. Female recipients had an increased prevalence before transplant of idiopathic cardiomyopathy, antinuclear antibodies, and HLA-B8, DR3 haplotypes. After transplant, female sex predicted shorter duration to a first rejection, higher cumulative rejection frequency, and earlier posttransplant production of anti-HLA antibodies. Female recipients had higher early mortality rates (<6 months) that were due to infection. Fatal infections correlated with 2-fold higher cyclosporine levels in female recipients. However, the incidence of transplant-related coronary artery disease developing beyond 1 year after transplant was lower in female than in male recipients. Females undergoing cardiac transplantation are more likely to manifest features of an underlying autoimmune state. This may predispose to a higher posttransplant risk of allograft rejection and requirement for increased immunosuppression.

The exact indications for mechanical circulatory assistance are difficult to establish. Hemodynamic criteria are no longer sufficient. Circulatory assistance may be proposed for chronic heart failure patients with a high risk of death or in a situation of acute deterioration. Among these patients, several risk factors can be used to establish scores that have a better predictive value than risk factors taken alone. Two predictive models have been recently established. The first one takes into account 7 independent variables: etiology, heart rate at rest, left ventricle ejection fraction, mean blood pressure, intraventricular rhythm disorder, VO2max and serum sodium). In addition to these variables, the second model also includes pulmonary wedge pressure. In selected patients with acute heart failure, circulatory assistance is needed as early as possible to avoid irreversible multiple organ failure. The crucial problem is rapid assessment of the feasibility of heart transplantation. Several variables can be used to predict survival in candidates for mechanical circulatory assistance on the heart transplantation waiting list.

VE LVAS support lasted an average of 112 days (range, < 1-691 days), with 54 patients supported for > 180 days. Mean VE LVAS flow (expressed as pump index) throughout support was 2.8 L x min(-1) x m(-2). Median total bilirubin values decreased from 1.2 mg/dL at baseline to 0.7 mg/dL (P =.0001); median creatinine values decreased from 1.5 mg/dL at baseline to 1.1 mg/dL (P =.0001). VE LVAS-related adverse events included bleeding in 31 patients (11%), infection in 113 (40%), neurologic dysfunction in 14 (5%), and thromboembolic events in 17 (6%). A total of 160 (58%) patients were enrolled in a hospital release program. Twenty-nine percent of the VE LVAS-treated patients (82/280) died before receiving a transplant, compared with 67% of controls (32/48) (P <.001). Conversely, 71% of the VE LVAS-treated patients (198/280) survived: 67% (188/280) ultimately received a heart transplant, and 4% (10/280) had the device removed electively. One-year post-transplant survival of VE LVAS-treated patients was significantly better than that of controls (84% [158/188] vs 63% [10/16]; log rank analysis P =.0197). The HeartMate VE LVAS provides adequate hemodynamic support, has an acceptably low incidence of adverse effects, and improves survival in heart transplant candidates both inside and outside the hospital. The studies of the HeartMate LVAS (both pneumatic and electric) for Food and Drug Administration approval are the only studies with a valid control group to show a survival benefit for cardiac transplantation.

Patients were categorized into 6 diagnosis groups: cystic fibrosis (174), obstructive lung disease (163), pulmonary fibrosis (100), Eisenmenger's syndrome (76), pulmonary hypertension (68), bronchiectasis (51), and other (21). Using Cox regression, we estimated the time at which early operative risk of death fell below pre-operative risk levels (crossover point) and the point at which early high post-operative risk was offset by later low risk (equity point). The relative benefits of single lung vs double lung/heart-lung transplantation were assessed for patients with obstructive lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis. Post-operative risk of death fell below pre-operative risk levels for all diagnosis groups, indicating a survival advantage. The equity point was achieved for all distinct diagnosis groups (except Eisenmenger's); this survival benefit was significant for patients with obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension. Single lung vs double lung/ heart-lung comparisons showed no significant difference in survival benefit.

The medical records of all patients at our center who received a heart transplant more than 10 years ago were retrospectively reviewed for history of substance abuse. From a pool of 189 transplant recipients, 47 patients had a definite history of substance abuse (group 1) and were considered in recovery, whereas 142 patients were clearly without any history of substance abuse (group 2). Group 1 had a significantly greater percentage of patients with a pretransplantation diagnosis of idiopathic cardiomyopathy (P = .003), a higher occurrence of heart-related cause of death (P = .017), and a significant prevalence of noncompliance (P = .0001) and death because of noncompliance (P = .0004). In contrast, group 2 surprisingly had a significantly higher incidence of death related to infection (P = .0062), which is unexplained. Despite higher incidence of noncompliance in group 1, there was no significant difference in the overall survival rate between the 2 groups. These results suggest that patients with a history of substance abuse can undergo successful heart transplantation with acceptable long-term survival, though they are at greater risk for substance abuse relapse and resulting noncompliance with the treatment regimen. The extent to which relapse of substance abuse and its consequences affect the cost of posttransplantation care remains to be determined.

We sought to assess the influence of peritransplant ischemia and fibrosis on the development of allograft vasculopathy, acute cellular rejection and long-term outcome. Allograft vasculopathy is a common long-term complication of cardiac transplantation. One of the potential risk factors is peritransplant allograft ischemia. One hundred forty heart transplant recipients had baseline and one-year intravascular ultrasound analysis done to assess the progression of allograft vasculopathy. Serial endomyocardial biopsies were evaluated for cellular rejection, vascular rejection, ischemia and fibrosis. Based on histology, patients were classified into one of the following groups: nonischemic (n = 32), ischemia (n = 24), fibrosis (n = 62) or vascular rejection (n = 22). Three-color flow cytometry crossmatching (FCXM) was used to assess donor-specific human lymphocyte antigens (HLA) sensitization. Long-term outcome of patients in each group was assessed by estimating incidence of graft failure or deaths over a seven-year follow up. Patients in the fibrosis group had the lowest incidence of donor-specific HLA sensitization (40%, p = 0.008) and lowest average episodes of cellular rejection (1.7 +/- 1.4, p = 0.04), but they had increased coronary vasculopathy progression (change in coronary intimal thickness = 0.59 +/- 0.28 mm, p < 0.0001) and poor seven-year event-free survival (49%, p = 0.01).

Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is a major cause of mortality in heart transplant recipients. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of stress myocardial perfusion imaging in heart transplant recipients. We studied 166 patients (age 54 +/- 10 years, 140 men) by symptom-limited bicycle exercise or dobutamine (up to 40 microg/kg/min) stress myocardial perfusion imaging 7.4 +/- 2.5 years after heart transplantation. An intravenous dose of 370 MBq of technetium-99m tetrofosmin was injected at peak stress and 24 hours after the stress test. An abnormal test was defined as reversible or fixed perfusion defects. Perfusion abnormalities were detected in 55 patients (33%). During a median follow-up of 2.5 years, 54 deaths (33%) occurred, 16 of which were due to cardiac causes. The incidence of perfusion abnormalities was higher in patients with subsequent cardiac death than in patients without subsequent cardiac death (69% vs 29%, p = 0.01). In an incremental multivariate Cox analysis, cardiac death was not predicted by age, gender, duration of transplantation, number of rejection episodes, or cytomegalovirus infection. In the next step, stress test parameters were added. The peak rate-pressure product was the only significant predictor at this step (risk ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.73 to 0.97, chi-square 7.7, p = 0.006). In the final step, the presence of abnormal myocardial perfusion was an independent predictor of cardiac death (risk ratio 3.5, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 11.7, chi-square 4.7, incremental to clinical and stress test variables, p = 0.01).

Patterns of myocardial ET-1 expression were evaluated in 47 heart transplant recipients at 3 months after transplant. Transplant vasculopathy was documented by coronary angiography at 2 years after transplant. Expression of ET-1 was tabulated for both blood vessels and the interstitium. Vascular ET-1 expression was positive in 7/17 (41%) of patients with greater than grade 2 (International Society Heart Lung Transplant) rejection compared with 3/30 (10%) of patients with grade 0 and grade 1A rejection (P=0.02). Compared with patients with negative interstitial ET-1 expression (n=22), patients with positive interstitial ET-1 expression (n=25) had higher incidence of post-transplantation ischemic injury (52% versus 9%, P=0.002), lower mean episodes of acute rejection (> or = grade 2) during the first 3 months of transplant (1.09+/-0.66 versus 1.86+/-1.6, P=0.048), and more common vasculopathy at 2 years (50% versus 15%, P=0.02), and they tended to have worse survival (83.2% versus 100%, P=0.058).

We evaluated whether receiving a heart from a donor who had an aICB independently affected the outcome of transplantation. We reviewed adult patients (>18 years) who underwent heart transplantation between July 1994 and December 1999. We excluded patients who received non-standard hearts (e.g., donor age >55 years). Group 1 received hearts from donors with aICB (n = 80), and Group 2 received hearts from donors who did not have aICB (n = 171).

Older age, prior transplantation, pulmonary hypertension, and mechanical support are commonly seen in current potential cardiac transplant recipients. Transplants in 436 consecutive adult patients from 1994 to 1999 were reviewed. There were 251 using standard donors in 243 patients (age range 18-69 years). To emphasize recipient risk, 185 patients who received a nonstandard donor were excluded from analysis. The indications for transplant were ischemic heart disease (n = 123, 47%), dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 82, 32%), and others (n=56, 21%). One hundred and forty-nine (57%) recipients were listed as status I; 5 and 6% were supported with an intra-aortic balloon and an assist device, respectively. The 30-d survival and survival to discharge were 94.7 and 92.7%, respectively; 1-year survival was 89.1%. Causes of early death were graft failure (n = 6), infection (n = 4), stroke (n = 4), multiorgan failure (n = 3) and rejection (n = 2). Predictors were balloon pump use alone (OR= 11.4, p =0.002), pulmonary vascular resistance > 4 Wood units (OR = 5.7, p = 0.007), pretransplant creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL (OR = 6.9, p = 0.004) and female donor (OR = 8.3, p = 0.002). Recipient age and previous surgery did not affect short-term survival. Heart transplantation in the current era consistently offers excellent early and 1-year survival for well-selected recipients receiving standard donors.

Coronary allograft vasculopathy, a rapidly progressive form of atherosclerosis, remains the limiting factor in the long-term survival of heart transplant recipients. Some centers have attempted percutaneous coronary intervention to slow the disease process and thereby reduce mortality in these patients, but long-term follow-up data are scarce. We compared clinical outcomes in heart transplant recipients with coronary allograft vasculopathy who were treated either with percutaneous coronary intervention or with aggressive medical therapy alone. A retrospective analysis of all heart transplant recipients at our institution who underwent surveillance coronary angiography for coronary allograft vasculopathy between 1995 and 2000 was performed. Patients with coronary allograft vasculopathy were stratified according to whether they received medical therapy or percutaneous coronary intervention. Baseline demographics, results of re-vascularization procedures and outcomes were analyzed. From 1995 to 2000, 301 patients underwent 602 coronary angiograms. Of the 79 patients who had angiographic evidence of coronary allograft vasculopathy, 53 were treated with aggressive medical therapy, while 26 underwent percutaneous coronary intervention in addition to aggressive medical therapy. At baseline, patients treated with aggressive medical therapy tended to be younger (54.6 +/- 13.8 years) than patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (62.6 +/- 7.6 years; p = 0.0079). Ejection fraction at time of diagnosis of coronary allograft vasculopathy was similar for both groups (medical therapy group, 44.4 +/- 13.4% vs percutaneous coronary intervention group, 47.2 +/- 12.7%; p = 0.38). In our cohort, heart transplant recipients with coronary allograft vasculopathy demonstrated greater mortality than heart transplant recipients without coronary allograft vasculopathy (p = 0.016). Patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention had a 60% re-stenosis rate at 6 months if they were treated with coronary angioplasty and an 18% re-stenosis rate if they received a coronary stent. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no significant difference in survival in either treatment group at 1 year (80% for medical therapy group vs 95% for percutaneous coronary intervention group) or 3 years (68% for medical therapy group vs 79% for percutaneous coronary intervention group) after the angiographic diagnosis of coronary allograft vasculopathy. In this non-randomized trial, heart transplant recipients with coronary allograft vasculopathy were less likely to survive than patients without it.

According to the data of the Registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, donor and recipient female gender is a significant risk factor for mortality after heart transplantation. It has also been reported that donor-recipient gender mismatch is a determinant of post-transplant morbidity and mortality. To examine the effect of gender on the early and mid-term outcomes, we retrospectively reviewed data of a consecutive group of heart transplant recipients at our Institution. The study population comprised 99 patients undergoing heart transplantation between 1996 and 1998. This population was divided into four groups on the basis of donor and recipient matching. Group A consisted of 61 men who received male donor hearts, group B of 12 women who received female donor hearts, group C of 9 women who received male donor hearts, and group D of 17 men who received female donor hearts. Standard heart transplantation protocols were applied to all patient groups [graft preservation with Celsior solution, Shumway surgical technique, donor-recipient size matching > or = 1.0, induction therapy with polyclonal antithymocyte globulins, triple immunosuppressive therapy (neoral, azathioprine, steroids)]. The study groups were found to be homogeneous with regard to the major preoperative risk factors (etiology, status at transplantation, donor and recipient age, total ischemic time). Donor gender, recipient gender and donor-recipient gender mismatching did not significantly modify the short and mid-term survivals, functional recovery and freedom from rejection. Even though previous reports suggest that gender negatively affects survival, this factor proved to have no influence on the outcomes of the present series. These results can be explained by a correct donor-recipient size matching. The well-documented female recipients tendency to more frequent and fatal rejection was not confirmed in our experience. The patient's age at transplantation, the routine use of induction therapy and an aggressive immunosuppressive regimen may be the substrate of these findings.

Survival after transplantation in this-bridge-to transplant group and has been consistently 10-15% lower than patients who do not require a device. The result has been that our overall survival rate is beginning to fall. We have come to 2 major conclusions based on these results: First, the current UNOS system ranking candidates as Status 1A, 1B, and 2 may not identify those who are at higher risk for transplantation. It has failed to do so in our program. Rather, by grouping the potential recipients into patients with a device, Status 1 nondevice patients, and Status 2 patients, we have found a significantly lower survival rate after transplantation in the device group. This suggests that the problems shared by device patients such as being anticoagulated, having a difficult reoperation at the time of transplantation, and having increased inflammation and decreased immunity clearly place these patients in a very different risk group than other potential recipients. Second, these results lead us to believe that some high-risk device patients may not be suitable for transplantation and might be better if treated with devices as alternatives to transplantation.

Patient depression and anxiety scores were measured in both subgroups and their impact on pre- and postoperative mortality investigated. An initial sample of 152 patients with either ICMP (N = 57) or DCMP (N = 95) and end-stage heart disease awaiting heart transplantation were assessed in a multidimensional longitudinal study, including psychological and somatic variables. One hundred and three patients received a HTx and were followed up for a mean of 4.4 years. Proportional hazard models were computed to test for the influence of psychosocial and somatic factors on outcome. Preoperative depression and state anxiety scores were significantly higher in the ICMP group. In addition to donor and recipient age, ICMP patients in the preoperative high depression group also showed a significantly higher mortality after HTx. This result remained significant even after controlling for sociodemographic and somatic variables. Patient self-reported depression, but not anxiety, can contribute to the identification of subgroups of patients with an unfavorable outcome after HTx. It therefore may be helpful to screen for depression, particularly in patients with an ischemic cause of their end-stage heart disease.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is a possible cause of this disease which is characterized by diffuse intimal thickening resulting from smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. It has been reported that HCMV immediate-early (IE) proteins, IE1 and IE2, could play an important role in the development of this disease; however, the precise in vivo role of these proteins in causing GCA has not been clarified.

We sought to evaluate the relative effects of low doses of pravastatin (20 mg/day) and simvastatin (10 mg/day) on indices of cardiac allograft rejection.

The immunomodulatory effects of hydroxy methyl glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors have been increasingly recognized. Previous studies have demonstrated an ameliorative influence of pravastatin on hemodynamically compromising rejection after heart transplantation. A recent observational trial suggested that simvastatin 20 mg/day was associated with trends to lower survival and more adverse effects than pravastatin 40 mg/day. In a 12-month prospective, open-label study, 50 heart transplant recipients received either open-label pravastatin 20 mg daily (n = 24) or simvastatin 10 mg daily (n = 26) within four weeks of transplantation. Indices of allograft rejection including treated rejection, rejection with hemodynamic compromise, noncellular rejection, and mean one-year biopsy score were compared between the two cohorts, as well as with a statin-naive control population (n = 37). Lipid levels, safety, and post-transplant outcomes were also assessed as secondary end points. We found no significant differences in any allograft rejection parameter between the two groups. However, total low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but not high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides, were lower in the simvastatin arm (-23% vs. -11%, p = 0.02). No cases of rhabdomyolysis or myositis occurred in either group. Survival at one year was similar in both treatment groups (91% for patients on pravastatin and 92% for patients on simvastatin). Both groups had better survival compared with the statin-naive control group (80%, p = 0.04). Simvastatin (10 mg/day) and pravastatin (20 mg/day) are associated with similar beneficial effects on cardiac allograft rejection and one-year survival.

Charts were available for 509 patients (98%), 68 (13%) of whom underwent cholecystectomy before transplantation. Of the 509, 53 (10%) had serial ultrasound examinations and 29 of the 53 (55%) developed gallstones. After transplant, 47 (9%) underwent cholecystectomy. Five cholecystectomies were performed during the immediate postoperative course. Two patients who underwent cholecystectomy had acalculous cholecystitis; one was incidental. Four patients died (one with rejection and three with sepsis). After discharge, 42 cholecystectomies were performed: 16 for biliary colic (no deaths, three patients with complications), 19 for acute cholecystitis (one death, nine patients with complications), 5 for biliary pancreatitis (1 death, 1 patient with complications), and 2 others. The risk of morbidity and mortality from gallstone disease is high in cardiac transplant patients, particularly immediately posttransplant. Posttransplant patients require annual ultrasound examinations to detect the onset of gallstone disease, and this risk is higher than in the general population. Gallstones alone are an indication for cholecystectomy in the cardiac transplant patient. Pretransplant cholecystectomy should be considered in clinically stable patients with gallstones.

There was only one episode of late rejection (8 yr post-transplant) because of low drug levels in a patient with lymphoma and sepsis. This patient did not survive. Three other children (5.6%) also developed lymphoma and recovered but one died subsequently of graft failure. Four children have developed severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate GFR <30 mL/min/m2). Two have not survived and one is expected to commence dialysis soon.

Data for all children who received a heart transplant at the H\u00f4pital Cardiologique at Lyon from 1984 to 2001 and who were given Thymoglobulin as part of their immunosuppressive protocol were extracted. The dose of Thymoglobulin given depended on baseline platelet count and was 2, 1.5, or 1 mg/kg per day over 5 days for the following platelet count groups: greater than 150,000/mm (normal group), 100 to 150,000/mm (mild thrombocytopenia group), and 50 to 100,000/mm (moderate thrombocytopenia group). Thirty children of median age 14.2 years were given a median cumulative dose of Thymoglobulin of 8 mg/kg per patient; the moderate thrombocytopenia subgroup was given significantly less (6.4 mg/kg) ( P=0.032). Immediate tolerability of Thymoglobulin was good, with no cases of first-dose syndrome, anaphylaxis, or serum sickness. The platelet count decreased at the start of therapy, but recovered after discontinuation, and did not give rise to clinical concern. Patients were followed up for a median of 6.3 years (7 days-15.5 years); actuarial survival was 90%, 86%, and 74.5%, respectively, at 1, 5, and 10 years. In the first year, 50% of patients suffered an episode of rejection. The overall incidence of infection in the month following transplantation was 40%. One lymphoma occurred at 5 months. The use of Thymoglobulin in pediatric heart-transplant patients as part of an immunosuppressive protocol, with dose adjustment according to platelet levels, has been shown to be effective in terms of rejection rate and patient survival and safe in terms of the incidence of infections and malignancy.

As Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cp), a common cause of respiratory infection, is of vasotropic character, chronic infection may be associated with the development of coronary disease, although there have been few reports on the impact of Cp infection on the post-orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) survival rate. A total of 41 patients (4 females) were followed up for one year after OHT. Serology investigations for IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies against Cp were performed using the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out with respect to IgA, IgG, gender and type of cardiomyopathy. The IgA-IgG joint effect was also studied. The one-year survival rate was reported for patients with IgA < 8 EIU to be 72.2%, whereas those with IgA >or= 8 EIU accounted for only 43.5% (Kaplan-Meier analysis, p = 0.0548). In multivariate analysis IgA /IgG status proved to be a highly significant factor in survival. IgA positive outcome combined with IgG negative outcome showed that the relative risk of death equaled 12.08 versus other combinations of IgA/IgG status. In the Cox multivariate model ischemic cardiomyopathy showed a relative risk of 2.79 (p=0.0594), although it was not significant in univariate Chronic Cp infection, as expressed through a high IgA level, seems to have adverse impact on the survival rate in one-year follow-up after OHT.

Acute graft failure (AGF) is defined as significant failure of myocardial function in a newly implanted heart. The aim of the present study was to investigate a series of factors related to heart transplantation (HT) in relation to AGF. In a study of 287 consecutive HTs performed over a 14-year period, AGF was defined when: a) the surgeon observed ventricular dysfunction before closing the sternotomy; b) various inotropic drugs were required at high doses in the first days after surgery, or c) ventricular dysfunction was identified by routine echocardiography in the immediate postoperative period. Statistical analysis comprised a descriptive and univariate comparative study, followed by multivariate analysis based on application of a logistical regression model. The incidence of AGF was 22%. Predictors of AGF were female donor status (OR = 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.4; p = 0.02), a disproportion of more than 20% in donor-recipient body weight (OR = 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.3; p = 0.02), and background ischemic heart disease (OR = 2.5; 95% CI, 5.5-1.1; p = 0.03) or valve pathology (OR = 5.0; 95% CI, 7.0-1.5; p = 0.01). AGF is a frequent pathology, which was present in 22% of our heart transplantation patients.

Our purpose was to determine if there is a human ABO blood-group difference in porcine-human xenotransplantation. Plasma from six A, five B, seven AB, and six O individuals pooled by blood group were tested in an ex-vivo porcine working heart model. Blood-group A plasma-perfused hearts survived 20 +/- 14 min (n = 5), B 241 +/- 9 min (n = 3), AB 151 +/- 37 min (n = 5), and O 9 +/- 1 min (n = 8). A and O were different (p < 0.001) from B and AB. Function was significantly better in group B. Edema accumulation and creatine kinase change was highest in A and O. All groups had comparable levels of anti-alphaGal antibody, as well as comparable perfusion and operative conditions. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed the anti-B antibody levels to be predictive of survival (p < 0.001). At higher plasma concentrations, hearts perfused with B plasma survived longer (p = 0.01) than AB (218 +/- 45 min, n = 4 vs. 6 +/- 0 min, n = 3).

During this time period, 374 adult cardiac transplants were performed. Seventy-six patients (20%) were diabetic with 33 patients (43%) requiring insulin. Forty-two of the patients had moderate disease. Survival of the diabetic and non-diabetic recipients was comparable (1- and 3-year survival of 86% and 85%. vs 87% and 84%, respectively, p = NS). No difference in survival between \"medium-risk\" and \"low-risk\" diabetics was observed. The incidence of acute rejection in the first year, graft vasculopathy and infection, was comparable between diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

BALB/c recipients (H2d) preconditioned with lethal and sublethal doses of busulfan were injected i.v. and IL with 10(7) whole bone marrow cells (wBMCs) from B10 donors (H2(b)). Two hours after IL infusion of PKH-labeled wBMCs into myeloablated hosts, there were few labeled cells in the host peripheral blood (p < 0.001 versus i.v.) and femurs of the infused limb contained 57% +/- 7% PKH-labeled blasts (p < 0.001 versus 8% +/- 0.6% after i.v.).

We report our 10-year experience with 108 patients on MCS, who were supported for more than 3 months. Group A consisted of 38 patients (25 Novacor, 13 Berlin Heart) who underwent assist implantation from 1996 to 2001. They had a mean support time of 454 days (range 100 to 1074 days) and spent a mean of 326 days (range 20 to 769 days) at home. Group B consisted of 70 patients (24 Novacor, 46 Berlin Heart) who underwent assist implantation between 1991 and 2000. They had a mean support time of 234 days (range 95 to 795 days) and were not discharged. The patients were monitored for complications, hospital readmissions, and causes of death including infections and thromboembolic and bleeding events during the MCS time. Group A total mortality was 16% (6/38). Two patients died from cerebral embolism, one from cerebral hemorrhage, two from systemic infection, and one from multiorgan failure. Thirty-two patients (84%) required 95 readmissions to the hospital due to cerebral embolism (n = 9), bleeding (n = 1), wound infections (n = 23), coagulation disorder (n = 13) for heart transplantation (n = 5), and (n = 44).

Five hundred twenty-one consecutive adult cardiac allograft recipients between 1992 and 1999 were retrospectively studied. Of these, 105 were supported with a left ventricular assist device. Pretransplantation and posttransplantation antibody production, time to transplantation after listing, rejection, freedom from transplant coronary artery disease, and survival were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Among sensitized left ventricular assist device recipients, 26 were treated with a pretransplantation immunomodulatory regimen consisting of intravenous immunoglobulin and cyclophosphamide. There were no significant differences between left ventricular assist device recipients and nonbridged recipients with respect to pretransplantation demographic characteristics and ABO and HLA matching. Among left ventricular assist device recipients, 66% (69/105) were sensitized before transplantation; in contrast, only 6% (24/399) of nonbridged recipients were sensitized (P <.001). Sensitized untreated left ventricular assist device recipients had both a prolongation of waiting time to transplantation and an increased risk of acute rejection. Pretransplantation immunomodulatory therapy reduced both the increased waiting time and the increased risk of acute rejection. However, sensitization or the use of immunomodulatory therapy in left ventricular assist device-bridged recipients did not influence posttransplantation survival relative to nonbridged recipients. Left ventricular assist device recipients have survival outcomes similar to those of nonbridged recipients after cardiac transplantation, despite their significantly higher immunologic risk. The reduced rate of transplantation and the increased incidence of rejection observed in sensitized left ventricular assist device recipients are prevented by immunomodulatory therapy. Sensitization will remain an important issue with increased use of left ventricular assist devices, and improved understanding of this is essential to achieve better outcomes in the management of patients with end-stage heart failure.

Additionally, little data exist on racial differences between these two groups after cardiac transplantation. This study examines a single center, urban experience in treating African Americans and Caucasians with heart failure and after cardiac transplantation. We hypothesize that treatment in a specialized, comprehensive heart failure/cardiac transplantation program results in similar survival between African Americans and Caucasians. We retrospectively reviewed the Rush Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplant Database from July 1994 to August 2000. Variables analyzed in the cardiomyopathy patients included survival (until death, placement of left ventricular assist device or cardiac transplantation), number of hospitalizations per year, length of stay per year, and utilization of outpatient resources. Follow-up period was from initial visit to death, transplantation, or implantation of left ventricular assist device. In those who underwent cardiac transplantation, we examined rejection rates (cellular and humoral), rejection burden, hospitalization data, and 5-year survival. A subgroup bridged to cardiac transplantation with a left ventricular device was also analyzed. Seven hundred thirty-four cardiomyopathy patients were identified: 203 were African Americans and 531 were Caucasians. The etiology of cardiomyopathy was more commonly ischemic in Caucasians as compared to non-ischemic in African Americans (P <.01). African Americans had more admissions to the hospital per year compared with Caucasians, 1.2 +/- 2.1 versus.5 +/- 1.1 (P <.01) with longer length of stay per year, 1.4 +/- 25.2 days versus 4.4 +/- 14.3 days (P <.01). Utilization of outpatient resources was significantly higher in African Americans compared with Caucasians with more use of continuous inotropes (13% versus 6%, P <.01), intermittent inotropes (11% versus 5%, P <.01), and home nursing after hospital discharge (52% versus 32% of hospital discharges, P <.01). Survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis was comparable between the two groups (mean survival 1,470 +/- 72 days in African Americans versus 1521 +/- 46 days in Caucasians, log rank test [P =.6]). During this time, 30 African Americans and 73 Caucasians underwent cardiac transplantation.

Delivery of care to heart failure patients in a comprehensive, specialized program results in similar survival regardless of race despite higher utilization of inpatient and outpatient resources.

We reviewed our database in order to determine outcomes in patients with low EF after HT and to identify a subset of patients who would benefit from immediate retransplantation. We identified 825 patients who underwent HT at our institution between December 1983 and July 1999. Of these, 81 patients (70 men, 11 women; age, 48+/-12 years) had low (<35%) EF as determined by radionuclide ventriculography. Post-transplantation survival; duration of low-EF episodes (>2 years vs. <2 years); and incidence of transplant rejection, infection, and transplant coronary artery disease (CAD) were determined for these patients. On average, low EF developed 800+/-1029 days after HT and lasted 550+/-756 days until improvement, repeat HT, or death of the patient. Actuarial survival was 79% at 1 year, 55% at 3 years, and 46% at 5 years. Shorter (<2-year) episodes of low EF tended to have an earlier onset than prolonged (>2-year) episodes (656 days vs. 1341 days) (P=0.014). Patients with prolonged episodes (n=17) survived longer than patients with shorter episodes (n=64) (2247 days vs. 1266 days) (P=0.002). The incidence of hemodynamically significant rejection was lower in the prolonged low-EF group (6% [1/17] vs. 26% [17/64]) (P=0.03). The incidence of infection (31% vs. 53%) and incidence of transplant CAD (47% vs. 39%) did not differ significantly between the prolonged and shorter low-EF groups. Low EF after HT, especially with later onset, is not associated with poor survival and is not related to hemodynamically significant rejection. These data further indicate that the presence of low EF even in the setting of CAD is not by itself an indication for repeat HT.

Heart transplantation currently is the only accepted therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure, but the supply of donor hearts is inadequate, and different mechanical circulatory support systems have been investigated as bridges to heart transplant. Since April 1992, 53 patients (47 men, 6 women, aged 12 to 61 years) received left ventricle mechanical circulatory support as bridge to heart transplant. The two principal devices used were: the Novacor LVAS in 31 patients and the DeBakey VAD in 11 patients. All patients survived the operation. Mean duration of LVAD support was 2.8 +/- 5.6 months. Thirty-seven patients (71.1%) underwent heart transplantation. Twelve major bleeding episodes occurred in nine patients (16.9%). Globally, major and minor neurologic events occurred in 13 patients (24.5%). Ten patients (19.9%) assisted with the Novacor Wearable LVAS device were discharged at home while waiting for heart transplant (HTx). The mean follow-up of the 34 discharged transplanted patients was 45.3 +/- 37 months. Actuarial survival of transplanted patients while on LVAD was 91.0 +/- 4.9% and 83.4 +/- 8.5% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. No differences in post-transplant long-term survival and rejection and allograft vasculopathy occurred between patients transplanted with or without LVAD implanted. LVAD therapy proved to be effective in bridging patients with end-stage heart failure to HTx. While on LVAD support, patients assisted with implantable wearable devices could be discharged at home, ameliorating their quality of life. The excellent survival rate after HTx is concomitant with a low incidence of rejection and cardiac allograft vasculopathy. ", "label": 1}{"text": "Long-term results of cardiac transplantation.

Regulatory cells developed after donor-specific transfusion (DST)-induced acceptance of a LEW heart transplanted into a DA rat. Both DST and the cardiac transplant were necessary to generate the regulatory cells. This donor-specific tolerance can then be transferred into a new DA recipient by adoptive transfer of lymphocytes from the DST-treated long term survivor (LTS) in a dose-dependent manner. The effectiveness of tolerance did not diminish over five generations of adoptive transfer, thus supporting its infectious nature. Although both spleen and lymph node cells were equally effective, graft-infiltrating lymphocytes were more potent. A high level of indirect CTL activity and MLC proliferation were observed in lymphocytes from LTS. In vivo tracking of adoptively transferred CFSE-labeled splenocytes from LTS showed equivalent FACS proliferation and a higher percentage of graft-infiltrating lymphocytes 7 days after heart transplantation, compared with adoptively transferred naive splenocytes. Adoptive transfer of CD8(+)-depleted LTS splenocytes resulted in 100% subsequent LEW allograft acceptance; whereas CD4(+) depletion decreased acceptance to 40%, and depletion of both CD4 and CD8 resulted in 0% acceptance. When positively selected CD4(+) or CD8(+) cells were adoptively transferred, 100% or 62.5% of LEW cardiac allografts survived, respectively. In conclusion, DST alone promotes a donor-specific infectious tolerance of a heart graft that can be adoptively transferred to subsequent naive allograft recipients despite the undiminished in vitro immunological response to donor Ag. Although both CD4(+) and CD8(+) populations are responsible for the regulatory mechanism in DST-induced tolerance, the CD4(+) population appears to dominate.

We compared the morbidity and mortality rates of patients who had urgent heart transplantation or transplantation after bridging with a ventricular assist device, with the rates of patients whose clinical stability allowed them to wait at home. From March 1985 to December 2000, 404 patients underwent heart transplantation in a single center. There were 273 patients with UNOS status 2 (US 2), 103 patients with UNOS Status 1A (US 1A), and 28 patients with UNOS Status 1B (US 1B). We compared the groups retrospectively with respect to pretransplantation status and operative results. Despite more severely impaired hemodynamics and a significantly higher preoperative infection rate in US 1A and 1B patients, there were no statistically significant differences in survival rates among the three groups. Donor sex and age, cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis, mismatch rate, ischemic time, method of myocardial protection, and operative technique did not differ statistically among the three groups. Length of intensive care unit stay, postoperative morbidity, first year postoperative rejection rate, and graft occlusive vascular disease rate were statistically similar among the three groups. Although pretransplantation cancer assessment was less complete in US 1A and 1B than in US 2 patients, the late-cancer rate was not statistically different among the three groups.

HHV-6 infection occurred in 20 (66%) patients after a median delay of 18 days after transplantation. The virus was detected by polymerase chain reaction or culture, or both, in 15.7 % of blood specimens, in 14.5% of bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, and in many organs at postmortem examination; it was found by culture in eight patients. No clinical manifestations could clearly be associated with HHV-6 alone. However, patients with HHV-6 infection had a higher mortality rate than patients without HHV-6 infection (7 of 20 vs. 0 of 10; P=0.04), and all the deceased patients died during periods of HHV-6 infection. We did not observe higher incidence of infectious or graft-rejection episodes in HHV-6-positive patients. However, eight of nine viral or fungal infections occurred during HHV-6 infection and three were directly responsible for death. Although frequently detected after transplantation, HHV-6 was not associated with any specific clinical manifestation. The higher mortality rate observed in patients with HHV-6 infection was not related to a higher incidence of bacterial infections or graft rejection but might be associated with more viral and fungal infections.

Eight patients (9.6%) presented with coronaropathy of the graft, progressive for 5 of them. Renal function was altered in 12% of cases, especially in the patients transplanted before the age of 2 years. The results of paediatric cardiac transplantation are satisfactory.

The indication is not as clear-cut in transplantation performed early or as an emergency for primary graft dysfunction, which carries a high mortality. Renal failure and allo-immunisation are not contra-indications to this procedure. Occasionally, procedures of coronary revascularisation provide time to wait for a new transplant. In the absence of more effective preventive or curative treatment of coronary disease of the transplant, the good results of retransplantation justify the procedure for this indication and reinscription on the waiting list for cardiac transplantation.

Survival in patients awaiting cardiac transplantation is poor due to the severity of left ventricular dysfunction and the susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmia. The potential role of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) in this group of patients has been the subject of increasing interest. The aims of this study were to ascertain whether ICDs improve the survival rate of patients on the waiting list for cardiac transplantation and whether any improvement is independent of concomitant beta-blocker or amiodarone therapy. Data comprised findings from 310 consecutive patients at a single center who were evaluated and deemed suitable for cardiac transplantation and placed on the waiting list. Kaplan-Meier actuarial approach was used for survival analysis. Survival analysis censored patients at time of transplantation or death. Of the 310 patients, 111 (35.8%) underwent successful cardiac transplantation and 164 (52.9%) died while waiting; 35 patients remain on the waiting list. Fifty-nine (19%) patients had ICD placement for ventricular arrhythmias prior to or after being listed. Twenty-nine (49.1%) ICD patients survived until cardiac transplantation, 13 (22%) patients died, and 17 (28.8%) remain on the waiting list. Among non-ICD patients, 82 (32.7%) received transplants, 151 (60.2%) died, and 18 (7.2%) remain on the waiting list. Survival rates at 6 months and 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were better for all ICD patients compared to non-ICD patients (log-rank x2, P = 0.0001). By multivariate analysis, ICD therapy and beta-blocker treatment were the strongest predictors of survival. Further, ICD treatment was associated with improved survival independent of concomitant treatment with beta-blocker or amiodarone.

During 41 +/- 23 months of follow-up, 54 patients (22%) died or underwent heart transplant. On Cox univariate regression analysis, abnormal HRT onset, HRT slope, HRT onset combined with HRT slope, left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, LV size, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III showed a significant association with total mortality or the need for heart transplant. On multivariate analysis, abnormal HRT onset identified patients without transplant-free survival, as did LV size and NYHA class III heart failure. Major arrhythmic events were observed in 42 patients (17%) during follow-up. On univariate analysis, abnormal HRT onset, HRT onset combined with HRT slope, male sex, NYHA class III, LV ejection fraction, and LV size were associated with a higher incidence of major arrhythmic events. On multivariate analysis, only LV ejection fraction remained as a significant arrhythmia risk predictor, with a relative risk of 2.2 per 10% decrease in ejection fraction (95% confidence interval 1.5-3.2).

Posttransplant survival curves were similar for patients with emergency device placement and those with nonurgent placement (not statistically significant). Twenty-two patients having emergency device placement did not undergo heart transplantation because of multisystem organ failure (14), device support withdrawal from irreversible neurologic injury (4), device or technical problems (2), and left ventricular assist device explant due to myocardial recovery (2). At our institution, the majority of left ventricular assist devices are placed on an emergency basis.

All heart transplants performed in Spain since the start of transplant activity (May 1984) to December 31, 2001 were subjected to multivariate test using Cox regression in blocks of variables grouped into donor, recipient, immunosuppression, surgical and follow-up variables (a total of 111 metrics). Among the 3786 transplants early survival at 30 days after transplant was 86%, while survivals at 1, 5, and 10 years were 76%, 63%, and 50%. Variables associated with early mortality included acute graft failure, pulmonary vascular resistance >2.5 Wood Units (WU), prior thoracic surgery, respiratory obstruction, donor treatment with dobutamine, ventricular assistance, hepatic and/or renal dysfunction, hyperuricemia, mechanical ventilation, prior infection, duration of ischemia and/or extracorporeal circulation >4 hours.

In patients with PHT (pulmonary vascular resistance, PVR> or =2.5 Wood-Units (WU) and/or transpulmonary gradient (TPG)> or =12 mmHg) a short-term treatment protocol with PG-E(1) was performed, to achieve PVR<2.5 WU and TPG<12 mmHg. 61 patients (40%) had PHT according to our criteria. Reduction of PHT was successful in 71% of patients (n=43), of these, 18 patients underwent cardiac transplantation and the 1-year mortality rate was 22% (n=4). The 1-year mortality rate in transplanted patients without PHT was 14% (n=3). There was no statistical difference in survival between the PHT and the non-PHT group. Outcome in patients without heart transplantation was similar in both groups, except for patients with non-reducible PHT (1-year mortality 50%). Our study demonstrates the efficacy and safety of PG-E(1) in lowering PHT in heart transplant candidates, as well as the need for aggressive evaluation and treatment in these patients. Patients with reversible PHT have comparable post-transplant outcomes and no tendency to higher acute right ventricular failure.

Cardiac transplantation has become the established treatment of choice for eligible patients with end-stage congestive heart failure. Older recipients (over the age of 60) are sometimes regarded as too high risk for transplant. Because chronological age is frequently disparate from physiologic age, we hypothesized that with careful selection after a comprehensive screening evaluation we would be able to achieve comparable survival and quality of life in an older population. Between January 1989 and December 2002, 240 de novo adult cardiac transplants were performed for 74 female and 176 male patients. Prior to listing for cardiac transplantation, the patients were evaluated to exclude significant comorbidities that would limit survival or functional capacity postsurgery. In patients over the age of 60, particularly rigorous testing was conducted to eliminate significant extracardiac disease. The patients are divided in this analysis into three groups based on age at transplant (age 18 to 45, 46 to 59, and 60 years or older). Older recipients experienced similar rates of moderately severe cellular rejection (ISHLT grade 3A/ B). Survival as derived by Kaplan-Meier analysis was equivalent for all groups by Mantel-Cox logrank test (P = NS). The survival for patients older than age 60 was 83.1%, 73.7%, 67.7%, 57.4%, and 43.1% at 1,3, 5, 7, and 10 years posttransplant, respectively.

To date, little has been uncovered regarding the therapeutic potential of blocking ICOS signaling in the setting of transplantation. In a fully MHC-mismatched mouse model, we studied the effect of blocking ICOS signaling using a specific monoclonal antibody (anti-ICOS mAb) in combination with cyclosporine on cardiac and islet allograft survival.

During the last two decades, several advances have resulted in marked improvement in medium-term survival with excellent quality of life in pediatric heart transplant recipients. These were possible due to better donor and recipient selection, increased surgical experience in transplantation for complex congenital heart disease, development of effective rejection surveillance, and wider choice of immunosuppressive medications. Despite all of these advances, recipients suffer from the adverse effects of non-specific immunosuppression including infections, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders and other malignancies, renal dysfunction and other important end-organ toxicities. Furthermore, newer immunosuppressive regimens appear (so far) to have had relatively little impact on the incidence of allograft coronary vasculopathy (chronic rejection). Progress in our understanding of the immunologic mechanisms of rejection and graft acceptance should lead to more targeted immunosuppressive therapy and avoidance of non-specific immunosuppression. The ultimate goal is to induce a state of tolerance, wherein the recipient will accept the allograft indefinitely without the need for long-term immunosuppression and yet remain immunocompetent to other antigens. This quest is currently being realized in many animal models of solid organ transplantation and offers great hope for the future.

An allocation policy incorporating the initial clinical profile of the transplant candidates further reduced waiting list mortality by 1.7%. Changing ABO rules toward identical matching yielded a slightly more equitable survival for the different groups, without an overall effect on mortality. The best possible allocation policy is the policy where organs are allocated to patients that are at highest risk of dying, and withholding organs from patients that would eventually delist because of improvement.

These were compared with 197 recipients who were transplanted from trauma donors (Trauma group). A higher 4-year mortality rate was noted in the ICB group (24% vs. 14%, p=0.015). ICB as a cause of donor death was an independent predictor of recipient mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 2.02, 95% CI 1.27-3.40, p<0.0001). Compared with the Trauma group, the ICB group had an increased incidence of post-transplant graft dysfunction during the first week of transplant (10% vs. 3%, p=0.007), and higher incidence of interstitial myocardial fibrosis on their endomyocardial biopsies within 4 weeks of transplant (21% vs. 9%, p=0.0012). There was a trend towards an increased rate of allograft vasculopathy in the ICB group (competing risks adjusted hazard ratio 1.39, 95% CI 0.90-2.13, p = 0.14).

To address this problem, some propose using animals as a source of organs for transplantation, that is, xenotransplantation.

Bridging to transplant with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) can be limited by severe right ventricular failure (RVF). The focus of this study was to ascertain whether early implantation (< 24 hours) of a right ventricular assist device (RVAD) in patients with severe RVF improved survival and whether severe RVF adversely affected post-transplant survival. We conducted a 10-year review of our bridge to transplant experience using the Heartmate device (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA, USA), studying patients who required an Abiomed RVAD (Abiomed, Danvers, MA, USA). There were 243 patients who underwent LVAD implantation, of which 17 (7.0%) required an RVAD. Ten patients underwent early RVAD insertion (< 24 hours) while 7 underwent delayed insertion (> 24 hours). Bridging to transplant was successful in 11 (64.7%) RVAD patients versus 163 (72.1%) non-RVAD patients (p = 0.046). Of the 10 patients who underwent early RVAD insertion, 7 (70.0%) were successfully bridged. Of the 7 patients who underwent delayed RVAD insertion, 4 (57.1%) were successfully bridged (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in post-transplant 1, 5, and 10-year survival between RVAD and non-RVAD patients (71.4%, 71.4%, and 71.4% for RVAD patients, vs 90.5%, 80.4%, and 78.5%, respectively, for non-RVAD patients; p = 0.366). Pretransplant RVAD support was not a risk factor for post-transplant mortality (p = 0.864). Severe RVF adversely impacted bridging to transplant, although survival was improved with early RVAD insertion. The trend toward worse post-transplant survival in the RVAD cohort raises the possibility that if additional patients were evaluated, a difference in survival might be observed, suggesting the need for a multicenter analysis.

Reduced hemoglobin (Hb) levels after heart transplantation (HTX) are common; however, there are only limited data on the association of posttransplant anemia with survival. In the present study, the effect of Hb levels determined 7 to 12 months after HTX on survival was investigated in 156 heart transplant recipients (129 men and 27 women; age at transplantation, 51.3+/-10.45 years; follow-up, 6.77+/-3.6 years) by univariate and multivariate analyses including a broad range of clinical and demographic patient characteristics. Anemia by standard definition was found in 141 of 156 (91.6%) patients. According to Hb levels above or below the gender-specific median (men, 12.07 g/dL; women, 11.69 g/dL), patients were separated into a high- or low-Hb group, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significantly worse survival in the low-Hb group (P =0.033). Those patients showed significantly lower body weight, higher serum creatinine levels, and lower calculated creatinine clearance; the association of creatinine clearance and Hb levels was highly significant (P <0.0001). No differences were demonstrated between groups for age, preoperative cardiac diagnosis, diabetes, azathioprine, steroid or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medication, leukocyte and thrombocyte levels, rejection index, or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection or serostatus. Multivariate Cox stepwise regression analysis demonstrated that CMV infection, diabetes, and female donor gender were significant risk factors for post-HTX survival. An Hb level below the median was, however, completely lost as a risk factor (P =0.44); instead, a strong trend for reduced creatinine clearance could be demonstrated (P =0.09). Subsequently, a significant association was demonstrated between low calculated creatinine clearance and impaired survival by separate Kaplan-Meier analysis (P =0.02). Low Hb levels after HTX do not represent an independent risk factor for reduced survival, but the demonstrated correlation appears to be primarily caused by concomitant functional renal impairment. Further studies will be required to investigate the role of post-HTX anemia as a sensitive indicator of functional renal impairment and the effects of anemia treatment on long-term survival.

The introduction of cyclosporine into clinical practice of thoracic organ transplantation had a dramatic and positive effect on both short- and long-term survival.

Such combinations to calcineurin inhibitors include prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and Rapamycin. Based on data from our own institution 1- and 5-year survival rates of 86% and 78% can be obtained after heart transplantation and 76% and 59% after lung transplantation. Causes of death are described. Future immunosuppressive strategies will have to concentrate further on the omission of organ-damaging side effects. Also, not a single compound or combination for immunosuppression after thoracic organ transplantation has proved to be effective in cases with chronic rejection (eg, transplant vasculopathy in heart transplantation and bronchiolitis obliterans in lung transplantation).

Its use enabled directed immunosuppression with a consequent decrease in the incidence of graft failure, acute rejection, and systemic infection. The early oil-based preparation, however, was difficult to administer and had limited bioavailability and unpredictable pharmacokinetics. The drug also has a fairly narrow therapeutic window with major long-term side effects, which include nephrotoxicity, malignancy, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. The introduction of a microemulsion preparation (Neoral) with improved bioavailability has been associated with lower rates of rejection and comparable tolerability, therefore allowing the use of lower doses. Traditionally cyclosporine toxicity has been minimized by monitoring trough levels. Monitoring of levels 2 hours after dosing may provide a more accurate determination of cyclosporine exposure. The next phase in cardiac transplantation immunosuppression will most likely see a significantly diminished role for cyclosporine with the introduction of newer, more potent immunosuppressive agents with more favorable side-effect profiles. These agents, which include mycophenolate mofetil, sirolimus, and everolimus, also hold the promise of having a major impact on the development of transplant vasculopathy, which up to now has been an important determinant of limiting long-term allograft survival.

In 1967, Christian Barnard performed the first successful human-to-human heart transplant. Following this triumph, the ensuing decade saw a waning interest in heart transplantation given the complications related to rejection and immunosuppression. With the introduction of cyclosporine immunotherapy in the early 1980s, however, success was more the rule than the exception, and cardiac transplantation became an acceptable therapy. Currently, heart transplantation is considered the gold standard therapy for end-stage heart failure refractory to medical treatment. One-year survival is now approximately 85%, and 10-year survival approaches 60%. While the main obstacles in the early years of heart transplantation were immunosuppression, the current issue at hand is organ availability. Approximately 2500 heart transplants are done yearly, but the list of candidates exceeds 50,000. What is perhaps even more alarming is the fact that while the number of heart transplants performed in the United States has dropped every year since 1994, the prevalence of heart failure increases every year and is predicted to do so into the year 2030. Nevertheless, the last 20 years has seen dramatic improvements in the ways we diagnose rejection, the fine-tuning of immunosuppressive regimens, and the advent of better preservation techniques.

The Hospital for Sick Children (HSC), Toronto, Canada, has researched and applied the concept of crossing the blood group compatibility barrier. Heart transplantation at HSC unrestricted by ABO compatibility greatly contributed to decreasing the mortality rate among infants on the waiting list from 58% to 10%. From January 1996 to January 2002, 16 infants less than 14 months of age received ABO-incompatible heart transplants at our institution. The cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit is primed with additional volume to replace the patient's blood volume. Packed red blood cells (PRBC) used in priming must be ABO-compatible with the recipient. All plasma components and platelets must contain no anti-A or anti-B antibodies to donor or recipient. CPB is initiated and the patient's venous blood is collected into a transfusion bag and sent to the blood bank. The total amount collected should be one and a half to two times the patient's blood volume. The plasma is separated and discarded, returning only the PRBC, thus reducing the concentration of circulating antibodies to blood group antigens. Our team has experienced an 87% survival rate with this technique. The success is believed to be associated with the recipients' immunologic immaturity. Newborns do not produce isohemagglutinins, and serum anti-A and anti-B antibody titers usually remain low until 12-14 months of age. The complement system is not fully developed, therefore, the mediators of hyperacute rejection are absent during early infancy.

The decrease in useable donor organs means an increasing number of patients are requiring support with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for survival when their clinical status deteriorates before transplantation. We address whether these patients should be transplanted, if so, with what priority, and when and if they are not transplanted, what are the alternatives? The perioperative mortality and morbidity of LVAD insertion remains high. Infection and device failure still limit the safety of long periods of bridging and might necessitate earlier transplantation. Early results suggest that the smaller impeller pumps may be associated with a lower incidence of device failure and infection, but with more thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications. Transplantation of LVAD patients results in survival rates as good as those with conventional transplantation, and the survival benefit is better than for non-LVAD-supported patients. A small number of LVAD patients have shown a significant improvement in myocardial function, sufficient enough to allow explantation of the device. The proportion of these patients has previously been reported to be as low as 5%, but a strategy to maximize recovery has allowed pump removal in approximately two thirds of dilated cardiomyopathy patients. In a recent destination therapy trial, survival in LVAD patients was superior to those on medical therapy, but the frequency of infection, bleeding, and malfunction of the device was higher. LVAD technology is continuing to evolve quickly, while transplantation is here to stay.

To determine the possible causative agents of eosinophilic or hypersensitivity myocarditis in patients awaiting heart transplantation. Consecutive patient series. Large university-affiliated hospital. A total of 190 consecutive patients who had heart transplantation at our center. The myocardium of the explanted heart was examined for a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate containing an identifiable component of eosinophils. The relative quantity of each cell type was evaluated by a semiquantitative grading system (scored 0 to 3). The clinical findings and medications were reviewed, and patients were followed after heart transplantation. Eosinophilic myocarditis (EM) was found in the explanted heart in 14 patients (7.4%). Myocardial infiltration by eosinophils ranged from mild (n = 6), often focal involvement to marked (n = 8), usually multifocal or widespread involvement. Twelve patients (86%) had peripheral blood eosinophilia before transplant, and in ten (71%), the eosinophil count at least doubled. Loop or thiazide diuretics were used in all 14 patients, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were used in 12. Preoperative characteristics were similar in patients with and without EM, except for a higher frequency of inotropic support and assist devices in EM patients. Dobutamine was used in 12 (86%) and dopamine in seven (50%; one with dopamine alone), and one patient (7%) received neither dopamine nor dobutamine. In two patients receiving dobutamine and one receiving dopamine, tapering or discontinuation of the inotropic infusion resulted in a significant diminution of the peripheral eosinophilia and the EM before transplantation. Postoperative survival in patients with and without EM was similar at 8 yrs (50% +/- 13% and 54% +/- 4%, p =.34). No patient in this study has had EM on biopsy after transplant. EM is a complication of multiple drug therapy in patients awaiting heart transplantation, and should be suspected when peripheral blood eosinophilia is present or the eosinophil count increases by at least two-fold. EM may be related to intravenous inotropic therapy, and this is the first study to document improvement in myocardial pathology after inotropic drug withdrawal.

The use of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs; cyclosporine and tacrolimus) has dramatically increased medium-term life expectancy after heart transplantation but has had only limited impact on long-term outcomes for heart transplant recipients. The original oil-based formulation of cyclosporine has been superceded by a microemulsion formulation (Neoral), which has more predictable pharmacokinetics and allows more precise dose-tailoring. Cyclosporine microemulsion and tacrolimus (Prograf) have a similar efficacy in the prevention of acute rejection of heart transplants, but their use is accompanied by nephrotoxicity and by cardiovascular side effects. The efficacy of immunosuppression can be improved by adjunctive therapy, such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; Cellcept), corticosteroids, and induction therapy. One of the most important predictors of patient mortality at >5 years after heart transplantation is cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV)/late graft failure, which accounts for 31% of deaths. Neither cyclosporine nor tacrolimus have been shown to prevent the development of CAV. In terms of efficacy, MMF provides a modest advantage over azathioprine in preventing CAV, and the combination of cyclosporine plus MMF results in significantly lower mortality than cyclosporine plus azathioprine. Overall, CNIs have multiple cardiovascular side effects, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia and new-onset diabetes after transplantation, although cyclosporine and tacrolimus have somewhat different cardiovascular side-effect profiles. The challenge in choosing the best immunosuppressive regimen is to balance efficacy and safety to optimize graft and patient survival over the course of many decades. Because cyclosporine and tacrolimus have similar efficacy against acute rejection the choice of CNI for heart transplant recipients should be based on the relative risk of cardiovascular and renal side effects.

Waiting list and post-transplant information is used to assess the importance of patient demographics, risk factors, and primary cardiopulmonary disease on outcomes. The time that the typical listed patient has been waiting for a heart, lung, or heart-lung transplant has markedly increased over the past decade, while the number of transplants performed has declined slightly and survival after transplant has plateaued. Waiting list mortality, however, appears to be declining for each organ and for most diseases and high-severity subgroups, perhaps in response to recent changes in organ allocation algorithms. Based on perceived inequity in organ access and in response to a mandate from Health Resources and Services Administration, the lung transplant community is developing a lung allocation system designed to minimize deaths on the waiting list while maximizing the benefit of transplant by incorporating post-transplant survival and quality of life into the algorithm. Areas where improved data collection could inform evolving organ allocation and candidate selection policies are emphasized. ", "label": 1}{"text": "[Heart transplantation]. The first heart transplantation in the Nordic countries was performed at Rikshospitalet in Oslo, Norway in 1983 and the method is now accepted as a good treatment for selected patients. In this article we present a review of heart transplantation as it is practiced in our hospital. Because of donor shortage, the selection criteria are strict. It is most important that the patients are motivated and able to cooperate. They should be in heart failure class IV (III-IV) on the best medical treatment with no other treatment alternatives. Estimated survival without transplantation should be less than 6-12 months. Important contraindications are concurrent diseases with a more severe prognosis than that expected after transplantation. One-year and ten-year survival after transplantation at Rikshospitalet are 85% and 53%. The most important causes of death in the early postoperative period are rejection and infections. Later, the most frequent causes of death are accelerated coronary artery disease and cancer. Collaboration between the referring physician and the transplant centre is essential for a better prognosis for heart failure and after transplantation.

Implantation of a left ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplantation has become an acceptable approach for patients with end-stage heart failure. Our long-term results with 3 Thoratec HeartMate devices are presented to outline improvements in successful bridging to transplantation and post-transplant survival. From August 1990 through January 2003, 243 patients underwent implantation of Thoratec HeartMate devices as a bridge to transplantation. This included 52 (21.4%) pneumatic devices, 17 (7.0%) dual-lead vented electric devices, and 174 (71.6%) single-lead vented electric devices. Mean age was 49.7 +/- 13.7 years. Mean support time was 78.1 +/- 82.9 days (0-541). Bridging success increased from 63.5% (n = 33) for pneumatic devices to 64.7% (n = 11) for dual-lead vented electric devices and 72.4% (n = 126) for single-lead vented electric devices (P =.005). Posttransplant 1-, 3-, and 5-year actuarial survival increased from 87.5%, 78.1%, and 71.9% in patients with pneumatic devices to 91.5%, 86.9%, and 81.3%, respectively, for patients with single-lead vented electric devices. Device infection and malfunction occurred in 17.7% (n = 43) and 12.8% (n = 31) of patients, respectively. Successful bridging to transplantation and posttransplant survival has improved over time. Left ventricular assist devices have become increasingly more effective in bridging patients with end-stage heart failure to transplantation. This is likely due to a combination of better patient selection, improvements in clinical practice, and evolution in device design.

Diabetes is considered by some transplant centers to be a relative contraindication for cardiac transplantation because of concerns regarding decreased survival, as well as increased incidence of infection and transplant coronary artery disease. We evaluated our experience with diabetic recipients over the last 10 years. From January 1992 through June 2002, 881 patients underwent cardiac transplantation at New York Presbyterian Hospital. Of these, 161 (18.3%) were diabetic patients. Diabetic recipients were compared with a control group of 161 nondiabetic recipients matched for age, sex, cause of heart failure, United Network for Organ Sharing status, and immunosuppression era. Outcome measures included posttransplantation survival, incidence of infection, rejection, and transplant coronary artery disease. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between diabetic and nondiabetic recipients, with actuarial survival at 1, 5, and 10 years of 89.3%, 66.9%, and 45.6%, respectively, for diabetic patients and 87.4%, 78.8%, and 59.1%, respectively, for nondiabetic patients (P =.168). There was no significant difference in freedom from infection, rejection, or transplant coronary artery disease between the groups. By using Cox proportional hazard models, development of infection, rejection, and transplant coronary artery disease were independent predictors of decreased survival (P <.001, P =.004, and P =.004, respectively). These results demonstrate similar short-term and long-term survivals, as well as similar risks for infection and transplant coronary artery disease, in diabetic and nondiabetic patients undergoing cardiac transplantation. The trend toward worse survival in the diabetic cohort, however, raises the possibility that if a greater number of diabetic patients were evaluated, a significant difference in survival might be observed, suggesting the need for a multicenter analysis to validate these outcomes.

This study investigates the outcomes of cardiac transplantation using older donors. Despite high mortality rates on waiting lists, transplanting hearts from older donors remains a relative contraindication. We retrospectively reviewed data on 479 adult heart transplant recipients, 352 status I patients, and 534 status II patients enrolled on a waiting list between 1992 and 1999. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for statistical analysis. Of all donors, 20% were 40 to 50 years old and 8% were > or =50 years old. The risk of six-month mortality on the waiting list for patients who were not transplanted (status I: relative risk [RR] 8.5; status II: RR 3.7) significantly outweighed the risk of transplanting patients with a heart from donors >40 years old (status I: RR 1.6; status II: RR 2.1). Recipients of cardiac allografts from donors <40 years old had a one-month mortality rate of 5%, in contrast to 13% and 22% in those receiving allografts from donors 40 to 50 years old and > or =50 years old, respectively. Donor age did not influence long-term survival or frequency of rejections; however, it did correlate with the early presence of transplant-related coronary artery disease (TCAD). By the first annual angiogram, only 17% of recipients with donors <20 years old developed TCAD, in contrast to 26% to 30% and 34% of recipients who received allografts from donors age 20 to 40 years and >40 years, respectively. Despite a strong association between older donor age and increased post-operative mortality and TCAD, it is more beneficial in terms of patient survival to receive an allograft from a donor >40 years old than to remain on the waiting list.

Incompatibility of the major blood groups A, B, and O has been an absolute contraindication for heart transplantation. However, because of immunologic immaturity, infants may have relative protection from hyperacute rejection and thus could undergo transplantation with ABO-mismatched organs. Since January 2000, the authors have adopted a policy of considering infants for ABO-incompatible heart transplantation. Serum isohemagglutinin titers were measured before, during, and after transplantation. Two infants (3 and 2 months old) and a 21-month-old child underwent ABO-incompatible heart transplantation. During cardiopulmonary bypass, plasma exchange was performed. No other antibody-removal procedures were performed. A routine immunosuppressive regimen was used, and rejection was monitored by endomyocardial biopsies. An additional two patients (31 and 18 months old) were worked up but were unsuitable for ABO-incompatible transplantation because of high isohemagglutinin titers. They were successfully bridged to transplantation and received heart transplants from ABO-compatible donors. All three infants with ABO-incompatible heart transplants are fit and well, 40 months, 30 months, and 12 months postoperatively. All three had serum antibodies to antigens of the donor's blood group before transplantation. No hyperacute rejection occurred. No morbidity attributable to the ABO incompatibility has been observed.

Multivariate analyses of recipient and donor demographics and operative factors were performed to identify the predictors of low cardiac output, intraaortic balloon pump utilization, 30-day mortality, and duration of intensive care and hospital stay. Significant increases in number of female recipients (p = 0.025), cardiopulmonary bypass (p < 0.001), recipient cross-clamp (p < 0.001), donor age (p = 0.009), donor ischemic times (p < 0.001), use of cardioplegia (p < 0.001) and the bicaval technique (p < 0.001), brain death to retrieval time (p = 0.006), and need for postoperative dialysis were observed for the three study periods, whereas length of intensive care and hospital stay decreased. Female donor (odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 5.7) was identified as a risk factor for low cardiac output. Female donor (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.3 to 10.7), donor cardiac arrest (OR, 6.4; 95% CI, 1.6 to 25.9), and cardiopulmonary bypass time more than 2 hours (OR, 7.6; 95% CI, 2.1 to 28.1) were associated with increased intraaortic balloon pump utilization.

Seventeen percent (466) of adult heart transplant recipients were bridged to transplantation with a ventricular assist device. Almost half of patients with ventricular assist devices undergoing transplantation were upgraded to status 1A as a result of ventricular assist device-related complications occurring more than 30 days after ventricular assist device implantation. Creatinine and total bilirubin levels were less in patients undergoing transplantation after 2 to 4 weeks of mechanical support. One-year survival was higher in the nonventricular assist device than in the ventricular assist device group (85.7% vs 79.7%, P =.0004).

One-year survival among patients supported with a ventricular assist device for more than 30 days without complications was 91.4%. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a significant independent effect of the time interval from ventricular assist device implantation to transplantation on posttransplantation mortality and suggested that a period of lowest risk might exist between 1 and 3 months after implantation. Survival after cardiac transplantation is influenced by the time interval from ventricular assist device insertion to transplantation.

Pediatric cardiac transplantation is currently an accepted option for end-stage heart disease and congenital cardiac malformations. This report focuses on the anesthetic perioperative management in 12 yr. From 1988 to 2001 we performed 90 heart transplantations in 88 children, infants and neonates. The pediatric heart transplant program of the children's heart center at our university hospital started in June 1988 with the transplantation of a 2-yr-old boy who was suffering from congenital heart disease. Since then, 88 transplants have been performed. We divided our patients into two groups. Group 1 ranged from 1988 to 1996 and Group 2 from 1997 to 2001. The patient characteristics have not significantly changed over the years in our institution. At the time of transplantation, mean age of the patients was 2.6 +/- 4.3 yr from the period of 1988-1996 and 2.5 +/- 4.1 yr from 1997 to 2001. Since 1988, 90 transplants (Tx) in 88 patients have been performed. Two patients needed re-Tx within 2 days after the initial operation because of primary graft failure. Indications for Tx were congenital heart disease (n = 67) and cardiomyopathy (n = 21). In the subgroup of the patients suffering from congenital heart disease there were 46 with the diagnosis of HLHS, followed by endocardial fibroelastosis (n = 7); the remaining 14 patients had other complex cardiac malformations and some underwent corrective palliative cardiac surgery before Tx. Sixty-three patients were younger than 1 yr of age and only five children were older than 10 yr. Twenty-three percent of the patients on the waiting list died before Tx was possible. The overall survival rate was 79% at 1 yr and 73% at 5 and 10 yr. Infants with HLHS had a lower probability of survival after 5 yr compared with other diagnosis (69% vs. 84%). Until now 21 patients have died after Tx. The duration of anesthesia, time of CPB and the age at the time of surgery decreased over the years. It is always a challenge for the anesthesiologist to treat these patients with pulmonary hypertension as one of the most critical risks in this group of patients.

Cut-point analysis indicated the characteristic of donor age of at least 40 years (categorical variable) to predict mortality with the same degree of fit as age used as a continuous variable. Although we observed a substantial reduction in survival among patients who were allocated donor hearts at least 50 years of age, this difference was not solely attributable to the categorical variable of donor age 50 in this group. Donor age as a continuous variable, however, was determined to be a notable predictor of survival and use of the donor age cut-point of 40 years (categorical variable) allowed risk stratification with similar accuracy. The use of a donor age cut-point of 40 years may be a useful clinical criterion for graft-related risk assessment.

Between February 1987 and December 2002, 32 patients, aged 37 +/- 16 years, 19 males, with ejection fraction of 18 +/- 7%, underwent heart transplantation in our center. Seven (22%) patients were in NYHA class IV with hemodynamic support. Seventeen (53%) patients had idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), 7 (22%) had ischemic DCM, 3 (9%) had valvular DCM and the remainder had other causes of left ventricular dysfunction. Overall survival rate was 68% at first year post-transplantation, 59% at 5 years and 59% at 10 years. One year after cardiac transplantation, 95% of patients were in NYHA class I and the rest were in NYHA class II. Among the 13 patients who died, in five (18%) death occurred during the first month: the most frequent cause was hemodynamic failure. Causes of late death were: allograft vasculopathy (n = 3), allograft rejection (n = 1), infection (n = 1), sudden death (n = 1), hemodynamic failure (n = 1) and bradyarrhythmia (n = 1). Among the patients followed for more than one year, only three died. Early complications were: infection (8 episodes, 7 of respiratory location), right heart failure (3 patients), pericardial effusion (5 patients) and others (7 patients). Late complications were: a) allograft rejection: 17 (53%) patients, 72 episodes (10 ISHLT grade 3, 6 of whom were treated with intravenous corticotherapy, 8 grade 2 and 54 grade 1); b) infections: 19 (59%) patients; 35 episodes, 25 requiring hospitalization: 10 (28%) involving the respiratory tract, 6 (17%) the oropharynx, 5 (14%) the urinary tract, 4 (11%) the skin and 10 (28%) of undetermined location; c) chronic allograft rejection: 6 (19%) patients; d) arterial hypertension: 14 (45%) patients; d) renal failure: 5 (16%) patients; e) diabetes: 2 (6%) patients; f) cancer: 2 (6%) patients.

Sixty patients (TAC, n = 30; CsA, n = 30) undergoing heart transplantation were randomized into a prospective, open-label, controlled trial. Immunosuppression consisted of TAC or CsA in combination with MMF and corticosteroids. Target blood trough levels of TAC, CsA, and mycophenolic acid (MPA) were in the range of 10 to 15 ng/mL, 100 to 300 ng/mL, and 1.5 to 4.0 microg/mL, respectively. Acute rejection episodes (ARE); survival data; and adverse events with a special emphasis on infections, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and the development of graft vessel disease (GVD) were recorded. Baseline characteristics were well balanced. All patients were successfully withdrawn from corticosteroids within 6 months of transplant.

A noninvasive alternative for monitoring cardiac transplant patients uses the analysis of the ventricular evoked response (VER) obtained by programmed electrical stimulation. Rejection-sensitive parameters (RSP) and infection-specific parameters (ISP) are extracted from changes in the slope of the T-wave and from the duration of repolarization, respectively.

Common causes of death included: PTLD, cardiovascular collapse, and infection; all occurred at a median of less than 6 months.

Survival in patients receiving immunosuppression minimization (ISM) alone was 32%, with ISM plus other therapy was 27%, and with other therapies not containing ISM was 11% (P < 0.01). PTLD in cardiac transplant recipients is associated with low long-term survival rates. Analysis of PTLD therapies and outcomes suggest that immunosuppression minimization, when applied, improves survival. However, risk of sudden death may mitigate the positive effect of ISM.

Pediatric heart transplantation is a surgical therapy for dilated cardiomyopathy and for complex congenital heart defects with low pulmonary artery resistance. However, it is still discussed as controversial because of uncertain long-term results. We report our experience with pediatric heart transplantation in a heterogeneous population. Since 1988, 50 heart transplants were performed in 47 patients (30 with dilated cardiomyopathy, 17 with congenital heart disease). Mean age was 9.4 +/- 6.9 years (range, 4 days to 17.9 years). Twenty-three patients had a total of 36 previous operations. Clinical outcome was evaluated retrospectively. Perioperative mortality was 6% due to primary graft failure. Late mortality (12%) was caused by acute rejection (n = 2), pneumonia (n = 2), intracranial hemorrhage (n = 1), and suicide (n = 1). Mean follow-up was 5.24 +/- 3.6 years. Actuarial 1, 5, and 10 year survival was 86%, 86%, and 80% and improved significantly after 1995 (92% [1 year]; 92% [5 years]). There was no significant difference between patients with dilated or congenital heart disease (1 year: 86% vs 82%; 5 years: 83% vs 74%; 10 years 83% vs 74%; p = 0.62). Three patients with therapy resistant acute or chronic rejection and assisted circulation underwent retransplantation and are alive. Freedom from acute rejection after 5 years was 40% with primary cyclosporine immunosuppression regime and 56% with tacrolimus. Since the introduction of mycophenolate mofetil, freedom from acute rejection increased to 62%. All survivors are at home and in good cardiac condition. Pediatric heart transplantation is the treatment of choice for end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy as for congenital heart disease with excellent clinical midterm results. It is a valid alternative to reconstructive surgery in borderline patients. However, further follow-up is necessary to evaluate the long-term side effects of immunosuppressants.

A retrospective study of all patients who underwent heart transplantation at Papworth Hospital from 1979 to June 2001 (n = 879) and who died within 30 days of surgery was carried out. Postmortem examination data were available for all patients. The mean (standard deviation) recipient and donor ages were 46 (12) and 31 (12) years, respectively. Overall, the 30-day mortality was 8.5% (n = 75), 12.1% for the 1979 to 1985 period and 6.9% for the 1996 to 2001 period. The primary causes of death were graft failure (30.7%), acute rejection (22.7%) (1.3% for the 1996-2001 era), sepsis (18.7%) gastrointestinal problems (bowel infarction and pancreatitis; (9.3%), postoperative bleeding (6.7%), and other (12%). Our 30-day mortality compares favorably with the data from the ISHLT registry, with great improvement in the early mortality. Acute rejection is no longer a major cause of early mortality. Further reduction may be achieved by a better protection of the donor heart against the effects of brainstem death and ischemic injuries. However, the quest to improve early outcome should not be at the expense of needy patients by being overselective.

Two bi-allelic polymorphisms associated with high TNF-alpha production have been identified in the TNF gene locus, TNFA1/2, at position -308 and TNFB1/2 at +252. We hypothesized that recipient TNFA2 and TNFB2 homozygosity is associated with the development of CAV after heart transplantation. TNF gene polymorphisms were analyzed by multiplex fluorescent solid-phase mini-sequencing in 70 cardiac transplant recipients. Recipients homozygous for TNFA2 or TNFB2 (Group A, n = 29) were compared with recipients heterozygous or homozygous for TNFA1 and TNFB1 (Group B, n = 41). Coronary arteriography was performed annually or when indicated. Cumulative freedom from CAV and survival was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier test. Mean follow-up was 3.8 +/- 0.3 years. In Group A, 11 of 29 recipients (38%) developed CAV compared with 9 of 41 (22%) in Group B (p = 0.12). Cumulative freedom from CAV at 3 years was 42% in Group A and 80% in Group B (p = 0.043).

The results in Duke's C patients were particularly dismal. The early age at presentation of CRC in transplant recipients suggests that the development of de novo CRC may be effected by immunosuppression. Decreased 5-year survival rates in transplant recipients compared to the general population suggest that CRC in transplant patients is biologically more aggressive.

Thirty-day-post-transplantation mortality after isolated first time transplantation of the heart (n=1634) or lung (n=1162) in adults, between July 1995 and March 2004 in eight centres were monitored. CUSUM charts, with and without risk-adjustment and risk-adjusted VLAD plots were constructed. Thirty-day mortality rates for the UK as a whole were taken as the reference values for the unadjusted charts and a 50% increase in risk provided the basis for construction of boundary lines for the SPRT. Risk-adjustment was based on multivariate models previously developed from the national database. For heart transplantation without risk-adjustment, four centres crossed the lower boundary, indicating 30-day mortality was in-line with or better than seen nationally. Two centres were close to signalling an alert, warning of a rise in mortality rate, but neither chart signalled an alarm. After risk-adjustment one centre's graph moved towards the centre of the chart, indicating monitoring should continue and the other signalled an alarm. For lung transplantation the unadjusted mortality rate at one centre was confirmed acceptable and the results remained inconclusive for five. At the other centre, following an alert to a possible increase in mortality half-way through the sequence, results improved. Case-mix adjustment served to pull the charts away from the upper boundary lines; no chart suggested any cause for concern. For most centres the VLAD charts oscillated around the horizontal axis. CUSUM charts are useful tools for monitoring performance, and provide a basis for visually comparing results between centres and identifying periods of 'bad runs'.

Five year survival from death (any cause) or transplantation was 90.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 87.8 to 92.4) in patients with normal systolic function versus 52.4% (95% CI 25.2 to 79.6, p < 0.0001) in patients with SI. In patients who underwent serial echocardiography, 22 (4.8%, aged 41 (15) years) developed SI over 66 (40) months; the annual incidence of SI was 0.87% (95% CI 0.54 to 1.31). On initial evaluation patients who developed SI had a higher frequency of syncope (67 (15.2%) v 10 (45.5%) of those who did not develop SI, p = 0.001), non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (91 (20.6%) v 11 (50%), p = 0.002), and an abnormal blood pressure response on exercise (131 (29.7%) v 15 (68.2%), p = 0.001). Patients with SI had greater wall thinning (p = 0.001), left ventricular cavity enlargement (p < 0.0005), and deterioration in New York Heart Association functional class (p = 0.001) during follow up. Thirteen (59.1%) patients who progressed to SI died or underwent transplantation compared with 38 (8.6%) patients who maintained normal systolic function.

Limited data exist regarding the safety and efficacy of sirolimus in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor in heart transplant recipients. From January 2001 to June 2002, 31 de novo heart transplant recipients (treatment group) received a combination of sirolimus, tacrolimus, low-dose rabbit antithymocyte globulin, and glucocorticoids. Outcomes, such as actuarial survival, rate of rejection, incidence of infection, probability of developing diabetes mellitus, renal function, platelet and white blood cell counts, and incidence of coronary artery disease at 1 year, were compared with a cohort of 25 patients (control group) who underwent transplantation primarily in 2000 and in early 2002 treated with cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and glucocorticoids. All patients were followed up for at least 12 months. Kaplan-Meier actuarial 1-year survival rates were equivalent between groups (97% for the treatment group and 88% for the control group), as was freedom from allograft rejection (48% and 42% for treatment and control groups, respectively). No cases of transplant arteriopathy were noted within the first posttransplantation year. Renal function was not significantly affected in either group. There was a striking increased incidence of mediastinitis in the treatment group (19%) versus 0% in the control group (P = .02). Tacrolimus-sirolimus therapy was associated with a nearly 11-fold increased incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus as well (P = .004).

Chemokines regulate the recruitment and trafficking of leukocytes during an immune response. Animal models have shown correlations between chemokine production and leukocyte infiltration during allograft rejection. Also, antagonism of chemokine receptors in transplant models has produced prolonged graft survival. Individuals homozygous for a 32 base pair deletion in the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) gene have an inactive receptor. Renal transplant recipients homozygous for the deletion have been shown to survive significantly longer than those heterozygous or homozygous for the wild type allele. CCR5 ligands are upregulated during allograft rejection aiding infiltration of leukocytes. We investigated the influence of CCR5Delta32 polymorphism on outcome following human cardiac transplantation. Recipients and corresponding donors were genotyped for CCR5Delta32 polymorphism using polymerase chain reactions. We found no correlation between recipient genotype and outcome following transplantation. However, there was a significant correlation between donor genotype and mortality in patients transplanted for a nonischemic condition (DD = n/a, ID = 4%, II = 25%, P = .0014). The induction of CCR5 expression in endomyocardial biopsy tissue is known to correlate with leukocyte graft infiltration. We suggest that donor CCR5 may be more important for leukocyte trafficking during rejection than recipient CCR5 expression. The CCR5 gene is highly conserved, and due to the small population available for this study, more work is required from other centers.

Daclizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-2 receptor, reduced the risk of rejection without increasing the risk of infection among renal-transplant recipients and, in a single-center trial, among cardiac-transplant recipients. We conducted a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to confirm these results in cardiac-transplant patients. We randomly assigned 434 recipients of a first cardiac transplant treated with standard immunosuppression (cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids) to receive five doses of daclizumab or placebo. The primary end point was a composite of moderate or severe cellular rejection, hemodynamically significant graft dysfunction, a second transplantation, or death or loss to follow-up within six months. By six months, 104 of 218 patients in the placebo group had reached the primary end point, as compared with 77 of the 216 patients in the daclizumab group (47.7 percent vs. 35.6 percent, P=0.007), a 12.1 percent absolute risk reduction and a 25 percent relative reduction. The rate of rejection was lower in the daclizumab group than in the placebo group (41.3 percent vs. 25.5 percent). Among patients reaching the primary end point, the median time to the end point was almost three times as long in the daclizumab group as in the placebo group during the first 6 months (61 vs. 21 days) and at 1 year (96 vs. 26 days). More patients in the daclizumab group than in the placebo group died of infection (6 vs. 0) when they received concomitant cytolytic therapy. Daclizumab was efficacious as prophylaxis against acute cellular rejection after cardiac transplantation.

Total number of transfusions, total number of rejection episodes Grade 3A or more, rejection-free survival, and overall survival were analyzed. Comparisons between patients bridged to transplantation with a Novacor left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and the primary transplant group were also made. Eighty-two patients were transplanted. Fifteen were bridged to transplantation, and 67 underwent primary heart transplantation. Age and sex were similar for the LVAD group and the primary transplant group (45 +/- 11 vs 47 +/- 15 years and 67% vs 58% male sex, respectively). Mean follow-up was 658 +/- 486 days for the LVAD group and 708 +/- 548 days for the primary transplant group.

We tested the hypothesis that duration of donor brain injury and death would have an adverse effect on recipient rejection and mortality in pediatric heart transplantation. Ninety-three cardiac transplants were performed at our center from July 1, 1997, through June 30, 2003. The primary study end points were the number of rejection episodes and the time to first rejection. Secondary outcomes were early and late mortality. Among 88 recipients of 93 cardiac allografts, 5 (6%) and 1 (1%) received second and third allografts, respectively. Overall patient mortality (3 early and 2 late) was 6% (5/88), and overall graft loss was 6% (6/93). Median time from donor brain injury to declaration of brain death (brain injury interval), time from brain death to donor cardiectomy (brain death interval), and graft ischemia time were 38, 24, and 3.3 hours, respectively. Cox regression analysis (adjusting for United Network for Organ Sharing status, ventilator dependence, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and ventricular-assist device status, diagnosis of congenital heart disease, sex and cytomegalovirus mismatches, and type of immunosuppression) demonstrated that recipients of donor hearts with relatively long periods from brain injury to death declaration or from death to organ removal had significantly improved rejection-free survival (hazard ratios 0.3, P = .01, and 0.5, P = .05, for brain injury and brain death times, respectively).

As improved understanding of transplant-related death should improve survival, we report a single center's experience with pediatric heart transplantation including potential risk factors and causes of death during the early postoperative period. This prospective longitudinal study involved 51 pediatric patients ranging in age from 12 days to 15.1 yr (median: 3 yr). The following pretransplant risk factors were evaluated: diagnosis, age at transplantation, recipient sex, weight and blood type, blood type match, donor/recipient sex match, weight ratio, ischemic time, recipient's status, requirement for mechanical ventilation or circulatory support, dialysis, or inotropic support at transplantation. We also determined the actuarial survival, clinical outcomes, and causes of death in this population. Survival was 86% during the early postoperative period (</=30 days), 79.3% at 1 yr, and 76.8% at 3 yr. Seven patients died during the early postoperative period (primary graft failure, rejection, and infection). However, there was no difference in the frequency of any of the risk factors analyzed between these patients and those who did not experience early death. There was a correlation between the duration of intubation after transplantation and pretransplant risk factors (diagnosis, recipient status, requirement for dialysis, inotropic and mechanical ventilation support).

United Network for Organ Sharing records of heart transplantation for subjects younger than 18 years from 1987 to 2004 were reviewed. Indications for retransplantation and patient characteristics were evaluated. Analysis was performed with proportional hazards regression, controlling for other potential risk factors. Among the 4227 pediatric heart transplants, there were 219 retransplants. The most common indication for retransplantation was coronary allograft vasculopathy (51%).

Cardiac allograft vasculopathy continues to represent the major limitation to long-term cardiac allograft survival. Routine angiography and intravascular ultrasound fall short in their ability to detect microcirculatory aberrations. Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) myocardial perfusion grades (TMPG) have been used as a measure of microvascular circulation in patients treated for acute myocardial infarction. We studied the correlation of epicardial coronary anatomy with microvascular flow as determined by TMPG and correlated it with patient outcome. We enrolled 66 consecutive cardiac transplant recipients (49 men; mean age 52 +/- 13 years; range 15-70 years) undergoing surveillance coronary angiogram during a 9-month period. All angiograms were interpreted for epicardial coronary anatomy by an independent investigator. Another investigator, blinded for clinical data and angiogram interpretation, interpreted TMPGs. TMPG 0 was defined as no apparent tissue-level perfusion; TMPG 1 indicated presence of myocardial blush but no clearance from the microvasculature; TMPG 2 blush cleared slowly; and TMPG 3 indicated that blush began to clear during washout (blush is minimally persistent after 3 cardiac cycles of washout). Cardiac deaths served as the primary outcome variable. Fifty-eight of 66 patients had an abnormal TMPG. Mean TMPG in all these patients was 4.2 +/- 3 (normal is 9). Forty-four patients (Group A) with no angiographic coronary narrowing had TMPG 4.81 +/- 3.1, and 22 patients (Group B) with epicardial coronary narrowing 40% of lumen diameter had TMPG 3.0 +/- 2.5 (p = 0.007).

The global shortage of donor organs and the relaxation of candidate selection criteria over time has resulted in recent controversy about the benefits of heart transplantation for some risk groups. We assessed the survival benefit acquired in the Papworth Hospital heart transplant population overall, taking into account resuscitated marginal donors and high-risk recipients. All heart transplant patients listed between 1979 and June 2002 were analyzed (n = 1,212). Of these, 931 cardiac transplantations were done, including the use of 126 marginal donors. High-risk recipients (n = 163) were defined as patients being in the hospital, on intravenous inotropic drugs, and/or with a high transpulmonary gradient (>15 mm Hg). Using Cox regression with transplantation as a time-dependent covariate, we assessed the survival benefit of transplantation. In our model we assumed that after transplantation the initial risk of death is high relative to continued waiting, followed by an exponential decline in risk. The crossover point (COP) is the time at which the risk of death after transplantation is equal to that of continued waiting (i.e., the relative risk is 1). The equity point (EP) determines the time at which the early post-operative risk is offset by the later period of lower risk and, therefore, the time at which transplantation has a survival advantage. Overall, the COP was at 54 days and EP at 141 days. In the marginal donor sub-group, COP was achieved at 32 days with EP at 72 days, indicating a survival benefit. The difference in the COP and EP between the borderline donor and normal donor sub-groups was not statistically significant. Post-transplant survival was not significantly different from recipients of normal cardiac allografts (p = .43). Likewise, for the high-risk recipient group, the COP and EP were at 72 and 203 days.

Patients were assigned to groups according to whether or not they received pravastatin after transplantation, and then compared with regard to transplant rejection, transplant coronary artery disease, and survival. Ninety-one patients received pravastatin after transplantation, whereas 37 did not receive any statins and served as controls. Pravastatin did not affect the overall incidence of rejections or number of rejection episodes. Hemodynamically significant rejection episodes occurred in 5 patients (5%) in the pravastatin group and 4 patients (11%) in the control group. Thus, pravastatin treatment apparently reduced the incidence of hemodynamically significant rejection episodes by 50% (p = 0.04).

The increase in serum creatinine levels after transplantation was less in the high-risk basiliximab group (-0.1 +/- 0.7) than in the high-risk CsA group (0.5 +/- 1.0, p < 0.02) and comparable to the low-risk CsA group (0.03 +/- 0.6). The basiliximab protocol did not increase rejection; the percentage of rejection episodes was high-risk basiliximab, 0; high-risk CsA, 13; and low-risk CsA, 3 (p = .13). Basiliximab induction therapy allows delayed initiation of cyclosporine after cardiac transplantation without an increase in rejection and reduces the risk of post-operative renal dysfunction.

The relationship between post-heart transplant cachexia and obesity with subsequent morbidity and mortality has not yet been reported. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to: (1) describe change in body mass index (BMI) from before transplant through 5 years after transplant; (2) identify risk factors for increased BMI at 1 year post-transplant; and (3) determine whether post-transplant BMI is associated with post-transplant morbidity and mortality. Patients (n = 3,540) were from a non-random sample having received a heart transplant between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2001 at 33 institutions of the Cardiac Transplant Research Database (CTRD). Patients were divided into groups using cut-offs for categories of BMI. Data were assessed according to frequencies, measures of central tendency, Pearson correlations, chi-square tests, multiple regression and stratified actuarial analyses with log-rank tests for comparisons. The level of statistical significance was set at p = 0.05. The number of obese patients increased significantly from immediately before heart transplant to 5 years later (17% vs 38%) (p < 0.0001). Risk factors for increased BMI at 1 year after heart transplant (explaining 56% of variance) included increased BMI at transplant, younger age, black race, non-ischemic etiology of heart disease, Status I at time of transplant and non-use of mycophenolate mofetil. Patients who were underweight or obese at 1 year post-transplant were at greater risk for rejection over time than patients who were of normal weight or overweight (p = 0.009). Both demographic and clinical factors are related to increased BMI at 1 year after heart transplantation. Post-transplant cachexia and obesity are risk factors for poor clinical outcomes after heart transplantation.

Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) insertion after anterior wall myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock is an accepted modality of support in select patients. Results of primary revascularization for these patients are poor. We seek to determine the outcomes of patients with myocardial infarction and shock who undergo LVAD insertion alone versus surgical revascularization before LVAD insertion. Seventy-four patients at 2 institutions underwent LVAD implantation for myocardial infarction and shock over a 12-year period. Twenty-eight underwent direct LVAD placement, and 46 underwent revascularization through coronary artery bypass grafting before LVAD placement. Variables examined included patient demographics, myocardial infarction-LVAD interval, bridge to transplantation, early mortality (< or = 30 days), survival after LVAD placement, and posttransplantation survivals. There were no differences in demographics between the 2 groups. The group undergoing revascularization before LVAD placement had a lower bridge to transplantation, higher early mortality, and lower overall 6- and 12-month survivals after LVAD placement compared with the group undergoing direct LVAD placement (45.50% vs 70.40%, P = .041; 39.10% vs 14.30%, P = .020; 89.3% and 82.1% vs 54.4% and 52.2%, respectively, P = .006). Posttransplantation survival and LVAD explantation rates were equivalent in both groups. Coronary artery bypass grafting before LVAD insertion for cardiogenic shock complicating myocardial infarction adversely affects survival. Confirmation of these findings would require conducting a large, multicenter, randomized clinical trial comparing revascularization versus LVAD support as primary therapy in this setting.

Organs derived from animals, most likely the pig, represent a potential solution to this problem. For the heart, 90-day median graft survival of life-supporting pig hearts transplanted to nonhuman primates has been considered a reasonable standard for entry into the clinical arena. Overcoming the immune barrier to successful cardiac xenotransplantation is most appropriately first explored with the non-life-supporting heterotopic model. We performed a series of 7 heterotopic heart transplantations from CD46 transgenic pigs to baboons using a combination of therapeutic agents largely targeted at controlling the synthesis of anti-pig antibodies. Rituximab (anti-CD20) and Thymoglobulin (rabbit antithymocyte globulin [ATG]; SangStat Medical Corp, Fremont, Calif) were used as induction therapy. Baseline immunosuppression consisted of splenectomy, tacrolimus, sirolimus, steroids, and TPC (an anti-Gal antibody therapeutic). Rejection events were not treated. By using Kaplan-Meier analysis, median graft survival was 96 days (range, 15-137 days; 95% confidence interval, 38-99 days). Only 2 grafts were lost as a result of rejection, as defined by cessation of graft palpation. There was no evidence of a consumptive coagulopathy, infectious complications were treatable, and no posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders occurred. No cellular infiltration was observed. This study reports the longest median survival to date (96 days) of pig hearts transplanted heterotopically into baboons. Duplication of these results in the orthotopic life-supporting position could bring cardiac xenotransplantation to the threshold of clinical application.

In more than 35 years of experience with heart transplantation, improvements in patient selection, surgical techniques, organ preservation, and postoperative management have increased survival rates and reduced complications. However, a number of significant complications continue, limiting the benefit of heart transplantation as the long-term solution for patients. Current survival rates are 83% at 1 year and 72% at 5 years, with 50% of patients surviving 9.4 years or more. Recipient and donor characteristics influence survival outcome. Primary graft dysfunction is the most frequent cause of death during the first 30 days. The function of the transplanted heart allows return to pre-illness activities, though denervation limits peak exercise capacity. Advances in immunosuppressive medications have decreased the incidence and severity of rejection, though only recently have shown promise in attenuating the incidence of cardiac graft vasculopathy, the major complication limiting long-term graft function.

This research reported the accumulated experience with cardiac transplantation in Chagas' disease, emphasizing reactivation, immunosuppression, and mortality. Fifty-nine patients undergoing cardiac transplantation had Chagas' disease with classically accepted recipient selection criteria. In this series, 84.7% of the patients were functional class IV; 36.0% used vasopressor support; and 13.5% mechanical circulatory assistance. One patient received a heart and kidney transplantation. After the initial experience the doses of immunosuppressants were significantly reduced with improvement in outcomes. The diagnosis of the reactivation of disease was documented by the identification of parasite in the myocardium, or on subcutaneous or serological exams. Reactivation of disease was significantly reduced by decreasing the immunosuppression. Immediate mortality occurred in 10 cases: three infections, two allograft dysfunction, two rejections, and two sudden deaths. Subsequent mortality happened in 14 patients: four by lymphoma, three by infection, two by Kaposi's sarcoma two by rejection, two by constrictive pericarditis, and one by reactivation of disease in the brain. There's no correlation between the disease and pre- or postoperative prophylaxis. The early diagnosis and specific treatment of reactivation did not leave functional sequelae in the myocardium. Reduction in immunosuppression significantly reduced reactivation of disease and neoplasms. The combined transplantation can be realized safely with more care about the immunosuppressants.

Evaluation at MCA's implantation, at day (D) 30 and at CT or patient's death (D) of body mass index (BMI=body weight (kg)/size (m(2)), albuminemia (Alb g/l), expressed as median values (med) and range (min-max). Odds ratio (OR) and CI 95%) were calculated. A multivariate analysis was performed to determine variables related to D or CT success. Thirty-four patients (30 men), median age 40.5 years (10-63), were included. MCA types were cardiac pumps (N=3); pneumatic (N=18) or electric (N=5) ventricular assist devices and artificial heart (N=8). Global mortality was 56% (19 over 34 patients) and at implantation in the global population (N=34) BMI was 19.4 (9.3-28.1) and Alb 24.6 g/l (15-37.5).

Pulmonary hypertension (PHT) associated with chronic heart failure (CHF) is a risk factor of right ventricular failure after heart transplantation (HT). Our aim was to study pulmonary vascular changes in patients with CHF and to assess any correlation with haemodynamic data. We studied 17 HT recipients with preoperative CHF who died shortly after HT. Preoperative haemodynamic information was obtained immediately before HT. Vascular lesions in muscular arteries were assessed by linear morphometry. Haemodynamic data were correlated with the morphologic changes. Mean transpulmonary gradient (TPG) was 8.9+/-4.5 mm Hg and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was 2.25+/-1.34 Wu. According to the threshold for at-risk PHT (TPG>12 mm Hg or PVR>2.5 Wu), six patients had at-risk PHT. Medial thickness was 23.82+/-7.23% in patients with at-risk PHT and 17.16+/-3.24% in patients without at-risk PHT (p=0.018). Medial hypertrophy of muscular pulmonary arteries is more common and severe than expected in patients with CHF, even in patients without at-risk PHT. This structural change could explain why PHT, even in range of values not excluding HT, is a risk factor for right ventricular failure after HT and influences post-HT haemodynamic behaviour.

Activation of T cells induces immunoglobulin (Ig)M-to-IgG B-cell isotype switching via costimulatory regulatory pathways. Because rejection of transplanted organs is preceded by alloantigen-dependent T-cell activation, we investigated whether B-cell isotype switching could predict acute cellular rejection and the subsequent development of transplantation-related coronary artery disease (TCAD) in cardiac transplant recipients. Among 267 nonsensitized heart transplant recipients, switching from IgM to IgG anti-human leukocyte antigens (HLA) antibodies directed against class II but not against class I antigens was associated with a shorter duration to high-grade rejection, defined as International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade 3A or higher (P<0.001), a higher cumulative rejection frequency (P=0.002), accelerated development of TCAD (P=0.04), and decreased late survival (P=0.03). Conversely, the persistence of IgM anti-HLA antibodies against class II but not against class I antigens for >30 days and the lack of IgG isotype switching were associated with protection against both acute rejection (P=0.02) and TCAD (P=0.05). Alloisotype switching coincided with T-cell activation, as evidenced by increased serum levels of soluble CD40 ligand costimulatory molecules. Finally, a case-control study showed that reduction of cardiac allograft rejection by mycophenolic acid was accompanied by reduced CD40 ligand serum levels and the prevention of IgM-to-IgG anti-HLA class II antibody switching. T-cell-dependent B-cell isotype switching and the consequent production of IgG anti-HLA class II antibodies are strongly correlated with acute cellular rejection, a high incidence of recurrent rejections, TCAD, and poor long-term survival. Detecting this isotype switch is a clinically useful surrogate marker for in vivo T-cell activation and may provide a noninvasive approach for monitoring the efficacy of T-cell targeted immunosuppressive therapy in heart transplant recipients.

Spontaneous reversal of early heart damage or correction of poor cardiac performance can yield outcomes equivalent to outcomes in recipients who had ideal donors. Hemodynamic goals developed in the operating room can be applied in intensive care to improve outcomes of transplantation. These goals include maintenance of mean arterial pressure greater than 60 mm Hg, central venous pressure less than 12 mm Hg, cardiac output greater than 3.8 L/min, cardiac index greater than 2.1, and systemic vascular resistance between 800 and 1200 dyne x sec x cm(-5).

Autopsy specimens from 5 patients and endomyocardial biopsies from 7 patients were used for this study. Endothelial, vascular smooth muscle, and Schwann cells were stained with antibodies against CD31 or Ulex europaeus lectin, smooth muscle alpha-actin, and S-100, respectively, and the Y chromosome was identified with in situ hybridization. Biopsy specimens from 1, 4, 6, and 12 months and 5 and 10 years after heart transplantation were evaluated. Y-positive cells were counted by conventional bright-field microscopy and confirmed by confocal microscopy. Endothelial cells showed the highest degree of chimerism, averaging 24.3+/-8.2% from extracardiac sources. Schwann cells showed the next highest chimerism, averaging 11.2+/-2.1%; vascular smooth muscle cells averaged 3.4+/-1.8%. All 3 cell types showed substantially higher chimerism than we previously observed for cardiomyocytes (0.04+/-0.05%). Endothelial chimerism was much higher in the microcirculation than in larger vessels. Analysis of serial endomyocardial biopsies revealed that high levels of endothelial chimerism occurred as early as 1 month after transplantation (22+/-6.6%) with no significant increases even up to 10 years after cardiac transplantation. Extracardiac progenitor cells are capable of repopulating most major cell types in the heart, but they do so with varying frequency. The signals for endothelial progenitor recruitment occur early and could relate to injury during allograft harvest or transplantation. The high degree of endothelial chimerism may have immune implications such as for myocardial rejection or graft vasculopathy.

One option to improve donor availability is the use of so called \"marginal donors.\" The aims of the present study are to analyze the short-mid term survival of cardiac transplanted patients in Italy, and investigate the effect of donor age on prognosis.

Organs from donors older than 55 years had a lower survival than organs from younger donors. By multivariate analysis, both donor's and recipient's age seem to be important determinants of graft survival. A more sophisticated analysis shows that the trend of the risk of graft failure according to donor's age is not linear, with a peak at age 47.3 years, and differs according to sex. Results from the present analysis suggest that the association between heart transplant survival and donor's age is not a linear one, but follows a complex mathematical model, with influences of sex, at least in our sample.

We created an alternate list that matched recipients in whom standard HT was contraindicated with donor organs that had been rejected for use in standard transplantation. Data on patient characteristics and outcomes were compared with a control group of patients transplanted on the standard list over the same time period. Fifty patients received HT on the alternate list, compared with 195 on the standard list. The most common reasons for recipient listing on the alternate list were age >65 years (n = 28) and diabetes with end-organ dysfunction (n = 9). Alternate-list patients were older and more likely to have an ischemic etiology and diabetes mellitus. The most common reasons for allocation of donor organs to alternate-list patients were coronary artery disease (n = 12), positive hepatitis serology (n = 12) or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (n = 8).

Certain cardiovascular risk factors have been linked to morbidity and mortality in heart transplant (HT) patients. The sum of various risk factors may have a large cumulative negative effect, leading to a substantially worse prognosis and the need to consider whether HT is contraindicated. The objective of this study was to determine whether the risk factors usually available prior to HT result in an excess mortality in our setting that contraindicates transplantation. Consecutive patients who underwent heart transplantation from November 1987 to January 2004 were included. Heart-lung transplants, retransplants, and pediatric transplants were excluded. Of the 384 patients, 89% were men. Mean age was 52 years (range, 12 to 67). Underlying disease included ischemic heart disease (52%), idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (36%), valvular disease (8%), and other (4%). Variables considered risk factors were obesity (BMI >25), dyslipidemia, hypertension, prior thoracic surgery, diabetes, and history of ischemic heart disease.

Immunosuppressive therapy has undergone great changes in recent years as a result of the introduction of new drugs, presumed a prior to be more effective and better tolerated. The greatest advance seems to have been the introduction of interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor antagonists. The objective of this study was to determine whether the use of IL-2 receptor antagonists in induction therapy has implications for the development of rejection and survival. Three hundred sixty-five consecutive cardiac transplant patients who received induction therapy were included. Heart-lung and transplants in children under 10 years were excluded. Three groups were compared according to the induction therapy (OKT3, 10 days; OKT3, 7 days; and IL-2R antagonists). Each treatment corresponded to a time period: OKT3 10 days from June 1989 to April 1994; OKT3 7 days from May 1994 to October 2002; and IL-2R antagonists from November 2002 to May 2004. Baseline characteristics of recipient and donor, surgical times, postsurgical complications, maintenance immunosuppression, number of rejections, time (days) to first rejection, and probability of survival at 1 year were recorded. We used analysis of variance, chi(2) test, Kaplan-Meier curves, and log-rank test as appropriate. A P-value < .05 was considered significant. There were significant differences in the characteristics of the transplanted patients in the various time periods. Thus, recipients in the OKT3 10 day group had worse status but better donors, whereas recipients in the IL-2R antagonists group had better status but older donors with longer duration of ischemia. The incidence of acute graft failure was similar in the three groups. The number of rejection episodes in the first year was higher among the OKT3 groups (OKT3 10 days, 1.7 +/- 1.3; OKT3 7 days, 1.2 +/- 1.2; IL-2R antagonists, 1.0 +/- 1.2; P = .02) and the probability of survival at 1 year was also lower (OKT3 10 days, 74%; OKT3 7 days, 77%; IL-2R antagonists, 94%; P = .0007). Induction therapy with IL-2 antagonists offers important advantages over treatment with OKT3 in terms of survival, with absolute and relative risk reductions of 20% and 27%.

Whether being older than 65 years should be considered an absolute counterindication to heart transplant (HT), as it is in some centers, is controversial. In our centre, patients older than 65 years are accepted for HT if they satisfy stringent conditions. The aim of this study was to examine whether heart recipients older than 65 years have a greater risk of rejection, neoplasia, or mortality than younger ones. We studied 445 patients who underwent HT between April 1991 and December 2003, 42 of whom were older than 65 years and 403 who were 65 years or younger. The parameters evaluated were the cumulative incidences of neoplasias and rejections (ISHLT grade > or = 3A), and the survival rates 1 month, 1 year, and 5 years post-HT. The two groups had similar percentages of patients with at least one rejection episode (< or =65 years 56.9%, >65 years 51.3%; P > .05), and although there were proportionally almost twice as many tumors in the older group (14.2%) as in the younger (7.9%), this difference was not statistically significant either.

The recipients were divided into either normal (Group 1) or impaired (Group 2) pre-operative renal function. Impaired renal function was defined as creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 40 ml/min (Cockroft-Gault formula). Meanwhile, patients in Group 1 (normal) were defined by CrCl > or = 40 ml/min. The primary end points of the study were early and late mortality. The secondary end point included post-operative renal failure defined by the requirement of dialysis or renal allograft in the early post-operative period.

Immunologic factors include human leukocyte antigen mismatching, cytokine production, and activation of the cellular immune system. Nonimmunologic factors include diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cytomegalovirus infection, just to name a few. There are also donor and recipient factors including age, prior coronary artery disease in the donor heart, and mode of donor brain death. The diagnosis of graft coronary artery disease is especially difficult, partially due to the de-innervated allograft, as well as to its inherent predilection to affect the medium-sized and smaller arteries in a concentric and diffuse nature. Conventional angiography can overlook this condition because of the lack of eccentric plaques in larger epicardial arteries. Intravascular ultrasonography, by contrast, is more sensitive in detecting graft coronary artery disease but is unable to visualize the entire arterial system. Treatment is challenging and often unrewarding, leading to re-transplantation.

The impact of long-term mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) treatment on the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) after heart transplantation is an area of much recent interest. This study analyzed the effects of various immunosuppressive combinations, including cyclosporine (CsA), azathioprine (Aza), tacrolimus (Tac) and MMF, on the time of onset, extent and progression of CAV. Two hundred seventy-three consecutive heart transplant recipients (mean age: 51.2 +/- 12.2 years; mean follow-up: 6.8 +/- 1.9 years) were examined by coronary angiography on a yearly basis between 1995 and 2003. The extent of CAV was evaluated using a scoring system based on the severity of vessel stenosis. The onset of CAV was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and the log rank test for four treatment combinations, CsA/Aza (n = 47, 17.2%), CsA/MMF (n = 26, 9.5%), Tac/Aza (n = 62, 22.7%) and Tac/MMF (n = 138, 50.5%), and for the primary and the secondary immunosuppressants alone. The rate of freedom from CAV at 5 years was 47% with CsA/Aza, 66% with CsA/MMF, 60% with Tac/Aza and 70% with Tac/MMF. After 5 years, the Tac/MMF group showed a significantly lower incidence of CAV than the CsA/Aza group (log rank 7.58, p = 0.0059). CsA (n = 73) was compared with Tac (n = 200) and MMF (n = 164) with Aza (n = 109): the rate of freedom from CAV was 51.2% in CsA patients vs 66.1% in Tac patients (log rank 5.7, p = 0.017), and 54.6% in Aza patients vs 67% in MMF patients (log rank 4.36, p = 0.037). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that MMF decreased the incidence of CAV significantly (p = 0.041). In this patient cohort, Tac or CsA medication was not an independent risk factor for incidence of CAV nor for decreased survival. The choice of immunosuppression has an impact on the incidence of CAV. In terms of prevention of CAV, MMF is superior to Aza in either combination. A trend toward improved survival in MMF patients was noted. The lower number of rejection episodes in the MMF groups may have contributed to these results.

The new Lung Allocation Score (LAS) system was created to address issues related to extended candidate waiting time, limited organ supply, waitlist mortality, and post-transplant survival. All candidates age 12 and older will be assigned an LAS that determines their priority for receiving lung offers. Waiting time will no longer play a factor in allocating organs to these candidates. Pediatric candidates under age 12 will continue to be allocated donor lungs based primarily on their accumulated waiting time. The LAS is the end product of an algorithm that assigns priority to lung candidates who are at higher risk of death if they do not receive a transplant (waitlist urgency) and who are likely to receive a greater benefit of longer lifetime with a transplant than without a transplant (transplant benefit). A variety of clinical factors, including disease diagnosis, were found to be predictive of waitlist urgency and post-transplant survival among transplant candidates, and are used in the calculation of each candidate's LAS. Pediatric and adolescent lung transplant candidates will have first priority for receiving offers from pediatric and adolescent lung donors. The lung allocation system will undergo frequent periodic reviews by OPTN/UNOS Committees to ensure that the performance goals of the system are being met and to address modifications to the system as they become necessary. The heart allocation system is an urgency status system under which adult and pediatric candidates are prioritized for organ offers by increasing levels of medical urgency.

At the Hospital for Sick Children, we questioned the need to apply this requirement to infants, based on available scientific evidence regarding the immaturity of certain immune responses. Our experience with 23 ABO-incompatible infant heart transplants demonstrates that this procedure can be performed safely in infants. Moreover, we have shown that donor-specific B-cell tolerance develops following ABO-incompatible transplantation.

Patients who received a transplant between January 1996 and May 2002 were separated into 2 groups based on the need for VAD support as a bridge to transplantation. Transplant and Inpatient Pharmacy Databases and charts were queried for date of transplantation, degree of allosensitization, use of desensitization therapy, immunosuppressive strategies, number of treated rejection episodes, and specific causes of death. This study investigated 238 patients (125 VAD patients, 113 non-VAD patients). VAD patients were more likely to be allosensitized than non-VAD patients (20% vs 5%, p < 0.01). OKT3 was given to 22% of VAD patients as anti-rejection prophylaxis and 14% received pre-transplant plasmapheresis. Non-VAD patients rarely were desensitized (2.6% of non-VAD patients).

The role of cytokine gene polymorphism and its association with acute heart allograft rejection and cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is controversial. The role of growth factor gene polymorphism has never been investigated in heart allograft recipients. Seventy heart transplant recipients were studied. Mean age at transplant was 50.4 +/- 12.4 years (73% white, 91% male). Patients were followed for an average of 28 +/- 12 months. Cellular rejection episodes were determined based on criteria established by the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) associations with early CAV were substantiated when vasculopathy was determined by IVUS. Additional associations were identified with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) polymorphisms-1154 GG and -2578 AC (p < 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively).

Donor organ quality, in turn, is determined by a variety of factors including donor age and preexisting disease, the mechanism of brain death, donor management prior to organ procurement, the duration of hypothermic storage, and the circumstances of reperfusion. It has been recognized for some time that both the short- and long-term outcomes after cadaveric organ transplantation are significantly inferior to those obtained when the transplanted organ is obtained from a living donor, regardless of whether the donor is related or unrelated to the recipient. Brain death results in a series of hemodynamic, neurohormonal, and pro-inflammatory perturbations, all of which are thought to contribute to donor organ dysfunction. The process of transplantation exposes the donor organ to an obligatory period of ischemia and reperfusion. Traditionally, hypothermic storage of the donor organ has been used to protect it from ischemic injury, but donor organs differ markedly in their capacity to withstand hypothermic ischemia. Data from the Registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation indicate that the risk of primary graft failure and death rises dramatically for both the heart and lung as ischemic time increases. Based on these data, maximum recommended ischemic times for the donor heart and lung are 6 and 8 h, respectively. In this chapter, strategies aimed at minimizing the adverse consequences of brain death and ischemia/reperfusion injury to the donor heart and lung are discussed. These strategies are likely to become increasingly important as the reliance on marginal donors increases to meet the growing demand for organ transplantation.

The remaining patients continue to wait or have been removed from consideration due to improved condition. Survival at 1- and 3-years postlisting was 94% and 87% for patients who received transplants compared to 81% and 57% for patients who did not receive transplants (P < .01). A significant number of patients listed as Status 2 are upgraded in UNOS status or die while on the waiting list. Early and midterm survival is significantly better with transplantation. Identification of variables associated with deterioration may allow for better risk stratification in the future. At this point, transplantation offers the best outcome.

Cardiac transplantation still remains the gold standard despite recent success in organ-preserving therapy. However, organ shortage forces to process alternative therapies. Cardiac resynchronization therapy and cardiac contractility modulation are new and promising therapies, which are able either to delay or even prevent the need for cardiac transplantation. High-risk cardiac revascularization and valve replacement is another important therapy in especially evaluated patients. With newer organ-protective procedures and novel treatment options like the off-pump bypass surgery, end-stage heart failure could be treated successfully. The volume reduction surgery, the so-called Batista procedure, has its indication only in special selected patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. A modified procedure, the surgical ventricular restoration (SVR) therapy, however, has a definitive potential and is evaluated in a multicenter trial (RESTORE). Mechanical cardiac assist devices have still a high impact in the therapy of acute or chronic end-stage heart failure. By means of smaller devices with axial rotary blades, the high rates of thromboembolic events, infections and mechanical device complications were significantly reduced. Survival to transplant with mechanical assist device support is nowadays around 80%. New centrifugal pumps are tested in clinical trials right now. Passive cardiac support devices and the total artificial heart are limited to special indications. The organ shortage could be overcome with the xenotransplantation. However, the problem of hyperacute rejection and the risk of transfection of animal diseases limit the clinical use considerably. The cell therapy has probably the highest potential for the future. Still unsolved are problems with the potential trigger of arrhythmias and ethical preconceptions regarding embryonic stem cells. In summary, cardiac transplantation still remains the gold standard in the therapy of end-stage heart failure with 10-year survival rates of 50%. With increasing donor shortage a potential combination therapy of organ-preserving cardiac surgery and cell transplantation might be the future for the 21st century.

We investigated the short- and long-term results after heart retransplantation in terms of different causes of heart allograft failure. We sought to establish the data of heart retransplantation in Chinese compared with Western counterparts due to differences in heart allograft vasculopathy. From March 1995 to May 2005, eight heart transplantation recipients with allograft failure underwent retransplantation. Heart allograft failure was due to coronary vasculopathy (CAV) in six patients (75%) and acute rejection in two patients (25%). The mean interval to retransplantation was 32 to 84 months (mean 54.3 months). There were five patients who survived after heart retransplantation for CAV and no patient survived after an earlier diagnosis of acute rejection. Heart retransplantation is a feasible method with acceptable long-term survival rate for heart allograft failure. After careful pretransplant evaluation, retransplantation is acceptable. The survival after retransplantation for CAV is notably great than that after acute rejection.

A heart transplant is at present considered the treatment of choice in cases of terminal cardiac insufficiency refractory to medical or surgical treatment. Due to factors such as the greater life expectancy of the population and the more efficient management of acute coronary syndromes, there is an increasing number of people who suffer from heart failure. It is estimated that the prevalence of the disease in developed countries is around 1%; of this figure, some 10% are in an advanced stage and are thus potential receptors of a heart transplant. The problem is that it is still not possible to offer this therapeutic form to all of the patients that require it. Consequently, it is necessary to optimise the results of the heart transplant through the selection of patients, selection and management of donors, perioperative management and control of the disease due to graft rejection. Since the first transplant carried out in 1967, numerous advances and changes have taken place, which has made it possible to increase survival and quality of life of those who have received a new heart.

Although liberalization of donor criteria could expand the donor pool, the use of certain \"marginal donors,\" such as those who are hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive, is controversial. Little is known about the effect of donor HCV positivity on survival in cardiac transplantation. To examine the association between donor HCV positivity and survival among heart transplant recipients and to determine the effects of recipient age and recipient HCV status on this association. A multicenter cohort study was performed using the US Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. Adult heart transplant patients who received their transplants between April 1, 1994, and July 31, 2003, were eligible for inclusion. All-cause mortality. Of 10 915 patients meeting entry criteria, 261 received an HCV-positive donor heart. Mortality was higher among recipients of HCV-positive donor hearts at 1 year (16.9% vs 8.2%; P<.001), 5 years (41.8% vs 18.5%; P<.001), and 10 years (50.6% vs 24.3%; P<.001). Using Kaplan-Meier methods, 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 83%, 53%, and 25%, and 92%, 77%, and 53% for recipients of HCV-positive and HCV-negative donor hearts, respectively (P<.001, log-rank test). Recipients of HCV-positive donor hearts were more likely to die of liver disease and coronary vasculopathy. After propensity matching, the overall hazard ratio (HR) associated with receipt of an HCV-positive donor heart was 2.10 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60-2.75). Stratified analyses showed that HRs did not vary by recipient HCV status or by recipient age (for recipients aged 18-39 years: HR, 1.75 [95% CI, 0.70-4.40]; for recipients aged 40-59 years: HR, 2.23 [95% CI, 1.42-3.52]; and for recipients aged 60 years and older: HR, 2.07 [95% CI, 1.32-3.27]; overall P value for interaction, >.10).

A critical shortage of donor organs has caused many centers to use less restrictive donor criteria, including the use of adult-age donors for pediatric recipients. The purpose of this study is (1) to describe the supply of pediatric (0-18 years) heart donors, (2) to explore the relationship between donor age and long-term survival, and (3) to define threshold age ranges associated with decreased long-term survival. The United Network of Organ Sharing provided deidentified patient-level data. Primary analysis focused on 1887 heart transplant recipients aged 9 to 18 years undergoing transplantation from October 1, 1987, to September 25, 2005. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests were used in time-to-event analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curves and stratum-specific likelihood ratios were generated to compare survival at various donor age thresholds. The number of pediatric donors decreased (P < .001) over the study period, particularly from 1993 (n = 640) through 2004 (n = 432). Among recipients aged 9 to 18 years, univariate analysis demonstrated a statistically significant (P < .001) inverse relationship between donor age and survival. Stratum-specific likelihood ratio analysis generated 3 strata for donor age: the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups consisted of donors aged 13 years or younger (n = 611, 32.41%), 14 to 51 years (n = 1258, 66.7%), and 52 years and older (n = 16, 0.85%), respectively.

Pulmonary hypertension (PHT), defined as a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) greater than 2.5 Wood units [WU] and(or) transpulmonary gradient (TPG) greater than 12 mm Hg, is a risk factor for mortality in cardiac transplantation due to elevated postoperative right heart failure. Orthotopic heart transplantation is possible if PVR could be reversed below 2.5 WU and TPG below 12 mm Hg. We show the Muenster experience from the last 10 years. From April 1996 to December 2005 all cardiac transplant recipients separated into patients with and without PHT were included. All patients with PHT had successful reduction (PVR < or = 2.5 WU and TPG < or = 12 mm Hg) using prostaglandin I2 or E1.

Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) with continuous flow properties are increasingly used to bridge heart failure patients to cardiac transplantation. Advantages in comparison with the pulsatile LVADs are smaller size, better endurance, and lower thromboembolic events. However, whether these new pumps have similar pre- and posttransplant outcomes is not clear. Fifty patients with a continuous flow device (Micromed DeBakey, Houston, TX or InCor BerlinHeart, Berlin, Germany) were compared with an age-, disease-, and LVAD duration-matched control group (n = 80) supported with a pulsatile device (Novacor, WorldHeart, Oakland, CA or HeartMate, Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA). Age (44.3 +/- 13.4 vs 46.1 +/- 11.1 years), disease (idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, 58% vs 65%), and LVAD duration (138 +/- 131 vs 128 +/- 106 days) were comparable in both groups.

Interestingly, severe rejections were significantly more frequent in patients with a continuous flow LVAD (p < 0.001). The new generation of cardiac assist devices with continuous flow pattern has a similar rate of pre- and posttransplant mortality in comparison with pulsatile LVADs.

Primary analysis focused on 20,412 first-time heart transplant recipients aged > or = 18 years who underwent transplantation between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2005.

Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to compare time to event. Although posttransplantation survival was significantly better (P<0.001) among patients without DM (median survival 10.1 years) than among those with DM (9.0 years), survival did not differ (P=0.08) between those without DM (10.1 years) and those with uncomplicated DM (0 DRCs; 9.3 years). Among those with DM, survival was worse with each additional DRC: 0 DRC, 9.3 years; 1 DRC, 6.7 years; and > or = 2 DRCs, 3.6 years. Although acute rejection and transplant coronary artery disease-free survival did not differ between groups, renal failure and severe infection-free survival were worse in those with DM and were inversely related to the number of DRCs. Posttransplantation survival among patients with uncomplicated DM was not significantly different than that among nondiabetics. However, when stratified by disease severity, recipients with more severe diabetes had significantly worse survival than nondiabetics. Therefore, although DM alone should not be a contraindication to heart transplantation, given the critical shortage of transplantable organs, maximal benefit may be achieved by exploring alternative treatment options in patients with severe DM.

Patients referred for heart transplantation evaluation may be accepted for transplantation, or denied due to existing contraindications or judged to be too well. There is little knowledge about long-term outcome in patients considered too well for transplantation. Ninety-five patients (mean age 47 +/- 12 years, 73% men) judged \"too well\" at evaluation were included in this study. Acceptance for transplantation followed international guidelines. The follow-up (mean 4.5 years) was complete. Twenty of the 95 patients (21%) were eventually accepted for transplantation during the follow-up period. Twenty-one patients (22%) died, 13 without preceding acceptance for transplantation, 4 on the waiting list for transplantation, and 4 after transplantation. Cumulative and transplant-free survival at 1, 5, and 10 years were 91%, 82%, and 65%, and 90%, 70%, and 50%, respectively. In conclusion, long-term survival in patients considered too well for transplantation is better than in most contemporary series of heart transplant recipients, which suggests that the guidelines for acceptance are appropriate. However, almost one fifth of the patients die without preceding acceptance for transplantation or while on the waiting list, which illustrates the need for frequent reevaluation and tools to identify heart failure patients with an increased risk for sudden death.

A risk factor summation score was previously validated to successfully predict survival after insertion of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). We investigated whether this scoring system also predicts clinical outcomes after eventual heart transplantation in LVAD recipients. A retrospective review was performed on 153 consecutive patients who received an LVAD as a bridge to transplantation at 2 large-volume centers from 1996 to 2003. The scoring system was used to designate low- and high-scoring groups. Thirty-day mortality and 5-year survival after transplantation were equivalent between groups (4.46% versus 7.32% and 76% versus 70%, respectively). No difference was seen in length of posttransplantation ventilator dependence (2.83 +/- 0.49 versus 3.3 +/- 0.72 days) or intensive care unit monitoring (6.38 +/- 0.77 versus 6.97 +/- 1.1 days). However, low-scoring patients had a significantly decreased duration of inotrope support (5.57 +/- 0.45 versus 7.74 +/- 1.0 days, P = .035). A risk factor summation score may predict which LVAD patients will require prolonged inotropic support following heart transplantation.

We investigated the prevalence of candidates satisfying SCD-HeFT and MADIT-II criteria for prophylactic ICD among patients (n = 317) with CHF referred to our tertiary center for HT. In addition to standard clinical and laboratory assessments, baseline evaluation included two-dimensional standard transthoracic echocardiogram and 12-lead electrocardiogram.

Kidney disease after transplantation of a nonrenal organ has been described to be the result of the nephrotoxicity from the commonly used calcineurin-inhibitors as well as other factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate renal function and potential risk factors for the development of chronic renal failure among nonrenal organ recipients. We designed a single-center retrospective study including all 165 of our cardiac and liver recipients between February 1998 and October 2003, collecting clinical, analytic, and therapeutic data. We excluded double transplants and patients with survival less than 6 months. Creatinine clearance was calculated according to the Cockcroft-Gault and the Levey Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)-5 equations. Although 165 patients received a cardiac or liver transplantation, 17 died in the first 6 months and three were double transplants; therefore we analyzed 145 patients: 107 (74%) cardiac transplantations and 38 (26%) liver transplantations. There were 106 male and 39 female recipients. The mean age (+/-SD) at the time of transplantation was 54 +/- 10 years and the mean follow-up was 2.9 +/- 1.7 years. Urinalysis before transplantation was only performed in 33 patients (22.8%) including three (2.1%) who had proteinuria. Serum creatinine increased until 12 months after transplantation (P < .001), then it recovered its average level. Creatinine clearance calculated using the aforementioned equations showed a similar pattern, with a progressive decline to 12 months (P < .05), with eventual stabilization or even improvement. The factors that we observed to increase the risk of renal damage were age, female sex, obesity, and the presence of proteinuria prior to transplantation.

The effect of the disease on mortality and on other complications, such as infection or rejection, is unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate these factors in our heart transplant patients. We studied 365 consecutive patients who underwent heart transplantation between November 1987 and May 2003. We divided them in three groups according to whether they had pretransplantation diabetes (group 1), de novo diabetes (group 2), or no diabetes (group 3). Baseline variables and the development of complications were recorded, and findings were analyzed using Student's t test, chi squared test, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. There was no difference in the 1-year or 5-year survival rate between the groups (P=.24 and P=.32, respectively). Patients with pretransplantation and de novo diabetes were older (54.6 years vs 54.9 years vs 50.6 years, P=.04), had a higher prevalence of hypertension (48% vs 36% vs 23%, P=.001), and had more frequently been treated with tacrolimus (10% vs 12% vs 4%, P=.04) or steroids (92% vs 86% vs 70%, P=.001). The incidence of rejection during follow-up was greater in these two groups (64% vs 70% vs 45%, P=.001). Neither pretransplantation diabetes nor de novo diabetes had a negative impact on survival in our heart transplant patients. The disease's presence was associated with treatment with steroids and tacrolimus. In these patients it would be preferable to individualize immunosuppressive therapy.

Development of tricuspid regurgitation after orthotopic heart transplantation can cause heart failure along with renal and hepatic impairment and portends a poor prognosis. If tricuspid regurgitation causes significant symptoms, tricuspid valve repair or replacement is often required. This study was designed to study the effects of prophylactic tricuspid valve annuloplasty (TVA) during orthotopic heart transplantation on long-term survival, renal function, and amount of tricuspid regurgitation. Between April 1997 and March 1998, 60 patients (aged 18 to 70 years; 22 female) randomly received either standard bicaval orthotopic heart transplantation (group STD; n = 30) or bicaval orthotopic heart transplantation with DeVega TVA (group TVA; n = 30). Tricuspid valve annuloplasty was performed on the donor heart before implantation using pledgeted 2-0 polypropylene and sized to an annulus of 29 mm. Echocardiographic measurements, laboratory values, and hemodynamics were obtained prospectively and reviewed by an independent data analyst. Follow-up of patients as of December 2003 was complete. Although there was a perioperative mortality advantage in group TVA, there was no difference between groups in long-term survival. At the end of the study, however, there was a statistical difference (group STD versus group TVA, p < 0.05) with regard to cardiac mortality (7 of 30 versus 3 of 30), average amount of tricuspid regurgitation (1.5 +/- 1.3 versus 0.5 +/- 0.4), percentage of patients with 2+ or greater tricuspid regurgitation (34% versus 0%), serum creatinine (2.9 +/- 2.0 versus 1.8 +/- 0.7), and difference in serum creatinine over baseline (2.0 +/- 2.1 versus 0.7 +/- 0.8). Prophylactic DeVega TVA of the donor heart is durable and decreases the incidence of cardiac-related mortality and tricuspid regurgitation after orthotopic heart transplantation. In addition, there is improved protection of renal function. Considering the ease and safety of TVA and its advantages, it should be performed as a routine adjunct to orthotopic heart transplantation.

We investigated whether Type D personality (tendency to experience increased negative emotions paired with the nonexpression of these emotions) was associated with impaired HRQoL in heart transplant recipients. Data were collected from all surviving heart transplant recipients >or=21 years of age (n=186) with a mean (S.D.) of 7 (5) years following transplantation. Patients completed the Short-Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36) and the Type D Scale (DS14). Clinical data were obtained from the medical records. Of the 186 patients, 18% had a Type D personality.

Augmentation of soluble CD30 during kidney transplant rejection has been reported. Our study sought to determine whether the level of sCD30 prior to heart transplant could categorize patients into high versus low immunologic risk for a poor outcome. A significant correlation was observed between high levels of soluble CD30 and a reduced incidence of infection. None of the 35 patients with high pretransplant levels of sCD30 level (>90 U/mL) developed infections posttransplantation. However, 9 of 65 patients who had low levels of sCD30 (<90 U/mL) developed infections posttransplantation (P < .02). No remarkable differences were noted among the other clinical parameters. The results also showed that the high-definition flow-bead (HDB) assay detected both weak and strong class I and class II HLA antibodies, some of which (weak class II HLA Abs) were undetectable by the anti-human globulin cytotoxicity method. In addition, more antibody specificities were detected by HDB. In conclusion, we have observed that high levels of sCD30 prior to heart transplant may be associated with greater immunologic ability and therefore produce a protective effect on the development of infection post heart transplant. We have also shown that the HDB assay is superior to the visual cytotoxicity method to detect HLA antibodies, especially those to class II HLA antigens.

From the available evidence, it appears that a low BNP level in transplant recipients has a high negative predictive value for death. Why patients with higher BNP levels should be disadvantaged appears to be multifactorial. BNP titer may be influenced by severe rejection episodes and diastolic dysfunction, and possibly intracardiac pressure derangement. Although the concept of using a simple blood test to assess these patients sounds very attractive, further work is needed to define the exact role of this assay. Presently, it cannot be confirmed whether BNP can replace any of the current methods of assessing allograft performance and prognosis after transplantation.

Multivariate analyses in the hazard-function domain were used to identify risk factors for re-Tx and for mortality after re-Tx. Risk factors for re-Tx include ventilator support, African-American ethnicity and elevated creatinine. Patient survival was inferior to that after primary transplantation (PTx) with 1-, 3- and 5-year survival probability after re-Tx of 80%, 69% and 60%, respectively (p = 0.04). Patients re-transplanted for graft coronary artery disease fared better than those re-transplanted for early graft failure. A shorter time period between PTx and re-Tx was a significant risk factor for survival according to univariate analysis. However, risk factors for death after re-Tx by multivariate analysis included only early graft failure and rejection during PTx. Survival after pediatric re-Tx is inferior to that after PTx. Re-transplantation for graft failure and rejection are associated with high relative risks for death.

The percentage of emergency heart transplants carried out was 22%, which is considerably lower than in the previous year (i.e., 35%) and slightly lower than the average for the last 5 years (i.e., 23%). The early mortality rate was 10%, which is similar to that in the previous year and lower than the average for the last 5 years (i.e., 12%).

Average age of the patients who died was 50+/-6.5years (range 44-62) and did not significantly differ from those who survived. The donor network has grown up to fourteen different hospitals throughout Croatia. The limiting factor in cardiac transplant surgery is the number of available donors. Therefore in attempt to form a good transplant program it is crucial to form an efficient donor network. The number of performed cardiac transplantations is expected to rise until it reaches the number of available donors. With advances in operative technique and postoperative management--immunosuppressive therapy we have observed a remarkable drop in the early operative mortality in the studied period.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a known predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients with essential hypertension. The prevalence and significance of LVH in heart transplant recipients is unknown. Transthoracic echocardiograms were performed as part of a routine protocol 1 year after heart transplantation in 141 consecutive patients. Demographic and echocardiographic data were collected using patients' records and center-specific data from the Cardiac Transplant Research Database and analyzed to determine the prevalence and predictors of LVH at 1 year post-transplantation. Patients were divided into three groups based on left ventricular mass (LVM): normal (LVM <150 g); mild-moderate LVH (LVM 150 to 250 g); and severe LVH (LVM >250 g). LVH was common at 1 year after heart transplantation, present in 83% of heart transplant recipients. Univariate predictors of severe LVH were increased body mass index (p < 0.01), pre-transplant diabetes mellitus (p = 0.02) and pre-transplant hypertension (p = 0.01). By multivariate analysis, pre-transplant hypertension was the only independent predictor of severe LVH (hazard ratio [HR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 5.4, p = 0.05). Heart transplant recipients with severe LVH had significantly decreased survival, as compared to patients with normal LVM and mild-moderate LVH (p = 0.03). After multivariate analysis adjusting for age, race, gender, pre-transplant hypertension and diabetes, severe LVH remained a strong, independent predictor of mortality (HR 3.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 12.1, p = 0.04). LVH is common at 1 year after heart transplantation and is a strong, independent predictor of increased mortality. Hypertension before transplantation is an independent predictor of the presence of severe LVH at 1 year after heart transplantation.

The United Network for Organ Sharing provided de-identified patient-level data. The study population included 33,640 recipients undergoing heart transplantation between October 1, 1987, and December 31, 2004. Recipients were divided by donor age into terciles: 0 to 19 years (n = 10,814; 32.1%), 20 to 33 years (11,410, 33.9%), and 34 years or more (11,416, 33.9%). Kaplan-Meier survival functions and Cox regression were used for time-to-event analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curves and stratum-specific likelihood ratios were generated to compare 5-year survival at various thresholds for ischemic time. In univariate Cox proportional hazards regression, the effect of ischemic time on survival varied by donor age tercile: 0 to 19 years (P = .141), 20 to 33 years (P < .001), and 34 years or more (P < .001). These relationships persisted in multivariable regression. Threshold analysis generated a single stratum (0.37-12.00 hours) in the 0- to 19-year-old group with a median survival of 11.4 years. However, in the 20- to 33-year-old-group, 3 strata were generated: 0.00 to 3.49 hours (limited), 3.50 to 6.24 hours (prolonged), and 6.25 hours or more (extended), with median survivals of 10.6, 9.9, and 7.3 years, respectively.

Survival was studied among the 539 newly dialysed patients between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2005 in our Department. All patients were prospectively followed from the date of first dialysis up to death or 31 December 2005.

Five HT patients benefited from renal transplant. They were all alive at the end of the study period, while one patient among the 16 remaining on dialysis survived. HT patients with CKD who reached ESRF have a poor outcome after starting dialysis in comparison with other ESRF patients.

Between November 1, 1984, and October 3, 2005, 164 consecutive orthotopic heart transplants were performed on 154 patients. Characteristics: mean age 7.1 +/- 6.0 years, mean body surface area 0.8 +/- 0.5 m(2).

Heart transplantation is indicated for children with end-stage heart failure or complex inoperable congenital defects. Due to the shortage of pediatric donor hearts, various bridge techniques have been used for pediatric recipients to prolong patient survival until a heart is available. This study evaluates long-term outcome of bridge and nonbridge support for pediatric heart transplantation. Between March 1995 and June 2004, 18 pediatric patients underwent heart transplantation. Six patients (33.3%) underwent biological or mechanical bridge techniques before transplantation. Eight patients (44.4%) required perioperatively extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Patient data and records were retrospectively reviewed. Causes of death and long-term outcome were analyzed. Five of eight patients in the ECMO group (62.5%) were successfully decannulated and discharged home with excellent functional classes. No differences in rejection rate, survival rate, and functional class existed between the bridged and nonbridged groups. Overall 1-year and 5-year survival rates were both 83.3% and all have a good functional class. Pediatric heart transplantation can be accomplished with excellent early survival despite multiple prior cardiac operations and relatively severe illness. For the variety in small, low-body-weight pediatric patients, mechanical circulatory support using ECMO is suitable for managing sudden collapse while waiting for heart transplantation, and graft dysfunction after cardiac transplantation. The mortality rate is acceptable in this very high-risk group of patients and long-term outcome is good. ", "label": 1}{"text": "The Bergamo Kidney Transplant Program. Since the beginning of transplant activities in 1989, the Kidney Transplant Center at the Ospedali Riuniti Bergamo has based its clinical program on the most recent achievements of transplant medicine, in order to optimize the outcome of kidney grafts and improve the quality of life of kidney transplant recipients. Although the transplantation community attempts to keep up with increasing demand for transplantable organs, the supply continues to fall far short of the need. This observation prompted us to focus on the expansion of the available pool of deceased donor organs. In 1997, we established a dual kidney transplant program for donors older than 60 years based on a pretransplant histology protocol with a scoring system ranging from low-dose RATG and delayed CsA administration has been successfully adopted in this population of kidney transplant recipients in our routine clinic practice. In kidney transplantation, chronic deterioration of renal function and death with a functioning graft, mainly due to side effects of the medications, represents a major limitation for long-term success of many transplant programs. We recently documented that per-protocol biopsy more than one year after kidney transplantation is a safe procedure to guide change of conventional immunosuppressive regimens and to lower the risk of major drug-related side effects. In particular, substantial reduction of the CsA dose, leading to extremely low CsA trough level, has no major detrimental effect on renal function and histology during 3 years follow-up, while patients remain free of rejection episodes with concomitant steroid and azathioprine therapy. Novel induction therapies with Campath-1H or Simulect and low-RATG have also helped to minimize maintenance immunosuppression in most patients largely avoiding the use of corticosteroids, Monitoring a patient's exposure to immunosuppressive agents is a critical issue in a minimum of 0 (no renal lesions) to a maximum of 12 (marked changes in renal parenchyma). The assumptions of the proposed algorithm to guide acceptance of single suboptimal or dual marginal kidneys for transplantation were validated in a prospective pilot study involving centers in Europe and North America. Whether the encouraging short-term data translate into improved graft survival is currently a matter of investigation in a prospective, multicenter, matched-cohort trial. As kidneys from marginal donors have an increased risk of delayed graft function, we also studied strategies to manage and prevent this complication. A dual immunosuppressive regimen of basiliximab and transplantation. By pharmacokinetics studies, we documented that a fixed dose regimen of MMF--adopted in the majority of transplant units worldwide--might no longer be the best approach for the management of transplant patients, and MPA pharmacokinetic monitoring is advised. Similarly, we reported pharmacokinetic interaction of concomitant immunosuppression on blood levels of the new immunosuppressant sirolimus. We have a special multiorgan transplant program at our center for patients affected by rare diseases, such as the recurrent hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Based on genotyping for complement factor H-1, membrane co-factor protein or factor I gene mutations, we are exploring the possibility of combining liver and renal transplant or performing renal transplant alone in patients with recurrent HUS who have end-stage renal disease.

During the past 20 years, the number of older patients undergoing heart transplantation has steadily increased as a result of expanding indications for this procedure. At UCLA, 1,046 adult heart transplant procedures were performed from 1984-2004. Actuarial one-, 3-, 5-year survival rates for all recipients are 83%, 76%, and 72%, respectively. Our patients were grouped into 2 eras: those transplanted between 1984-1993 and those between 1994-2004. The current era, incorporating those patients transplanted between 1994-2004, may be defined by the introduction of pravastatin in 1994, which we have reported to benefit heart transplant patients. There were 403 adult heart transplant recipients in the pre-1994 era and 643 adult recipients in the current era. Additionally, patients were then grouped by age into those aged 18-61 years and those older than age 61 years. In the current era, there was less rejection and cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) with improved survival and comparable survival in younger versus older patients. Although cellular rejection has decreased over the 1990's decade, we have reported that the incidence of noncellular or humoral rejection in our cardiac transplant recipients has remained unchanged despite improved immunosuppressive therapies. Thus, there appears to be a need for newer immunosuppressive agents to treat humoral rejection effectively. CAV is one of the major factors limiting long-term survival in heart transplant patients. Early CAV can be detected by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), which is a new technology that detects intimal thickening in the donor coronary arteries. We demonstrated in the multicenter IVUS validation study that the progression of IVUS-defined intimal thickening > or = 0.5 mm in the first year after heart transplantation appears to be a reliable surrogate marker for subsequent mortality, nonfatal major adverse cardiac events, and the development of angiographic CAV through 5 years follow-up. The limitation on the number of transplants performed has been the number of donor organs available. We began the alternate list at our program in 1992, which is designed to match those patients excluded for regular heart transplant listing (mostly older patients) to marginal donor hearts which are unused. We have demonstrated that the alternate list patients who have undergone heart transplant have satisfactory outcomes. This has allowed expansion of the donor pool and offered heart transplantation to those patients who would not routinely have an opportunity for this life extending procedure.

Heart transplantation has been a treatment option in Norway for selected patients with terminal congestive heart failure since 1983. The number of transplants is limited by donor availability. Few Norwegian doctors are aware of the challenges to be expected in taking care of heart transplant recipients. In the present paper we therefore present our experience so far. We have followed individuals within our patient cohort for up to 22 years. The cohort consists of 522 patients (mean age 48.8 years +/- 13.6), somewhat unequally distributed from various parts of the country, reflecting the local referring practice. We have a complete overview of the patients who are partly followed up locally, but come to a control at least once a year at our hospital. Mean survival in these patients is 12 years. With an expected survival of less than one year without transplantation, these are strong results that compare well with international figures. Patients younger than 50 years at transplantation have the best prognosis regardless of donor age, while the combination of patients older than 50 years and donor above 35 years have the poorest chance of survival. However, patients are disposed to various severe complications. Initially after transplantation acute rejection, unspecific graft failure and infections are a threat; while complications such as chronic graft sclerosis, renal failure and cancer are complications that appear over time.

Data sources included the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Social Security Death Master File. All PHTx recipients (age <18 years) in the USA from 1990 to 1999 who survived >1 year were included. ESRD was defined as long-term dialysis and/or kidney transplant. CRI was defined as creatinine >2.5 mg/dl, including those with ESRD. Relationships between pre-transplant characteristics and time to ESRD and CRI were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. The effect of renal disease on survival was analyzed using time-dependent Cox models. During the mean follow-up of 7 years (range 1 to 14 years), 61 of 2,032 (3%) PHTxs developed ESRD. Ten-year actuarial risks for ESRD and CRI were 4.3% and 11.8%, respectively.

Risk factors for CRI were: pre-transplant dialysis; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; African-American race; and previous transplant. Adjusted risk of death in those who developed CRI was 9-fold higher than in those who did not (p < 0.0001). After PHTx there is an increasing risk for CRI and ESRD over time.

We studied the epidemiology, microbiology, and consequences of infection in patients with VADs who ultimately had cardiac transplantation. Records of VAD-supported patients at our institution between January 1995 and January 2005 were identified by ICD-9 code. Infection was classified as driveline infection, pocket infection, mediastinitis, or VAD endocarditis in increasing severity of illness.

Sixty-two heart transplant recipients were enrolled in this study. All patients had coronary angiography at baseline and at 1 year, which were evaluated for TIMI FC and TIMI MPG. Also, 50 vessels in 35 patients were analyzed with volumetric intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) at baseline and at 1 year. Rejection episodes and mortality were recorded during the follow-up period. The mean follow-up interval was 51.5 +/- 17.2 months (range 12.2 to 78.4 months). TIMI FCs of all three coronary arteries and global TIMI FC (gTIMI FC) significantly increased from baseline during the first year (p < 0.0001). TIMI MPG deteriorated significantly (p < 0.0001 for left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries, p = 0.002 for right coronary artery). There was no correlation between changes in TIMI FC and progression of transplant vasculopathy as assessed by IVUS. Episodes of Grade > or = 3A rejection were significantly more frequent in the stable gTIMI FC group (p = 0.03). Mortality rate was significantly higher in the group with increasing gTFC (p = 0.02). gTIMI FCs and TIMI FCs of coronary arteries increase, and TIMI MPG gradually deteriorates during the first year after transplantation. Mortality rate is significantly higher in patients whose gTIMI FC increases from baseline. Change in gTIMI FC is a simple quantitative predictor of long-term mortality in heart transplant recipients.

In addition, creative approaches are being developed for the use of established immunosuppressive agents, with the goal of minimizing immunosuppression as early as possible posttransplantation. The hope is that these approaches will minimize the toxicity of these agents without sacrificing efficacy. Evidence suggests that the nephrotoxicity of calcineurin inhibitors can be reduced using these approaches. The introduction of newer immunosuppressive agents, including the proliferation signal inhibitors, raises the possibility that some of the long-term scourges of cardiac transplantation, including cardiac allograft vasculopathy and malignancy, can be ameliorated.

HLA typing data (major histocompatability complex [MHC] class I and II) were available in 923 patients and their heart donors. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the impact of HLA matching on long-term survival. The average follow-up period was 6.1 +/- 4.3 years (range, 0.0 to 15.0 years). In total, the 923 patients accrued 5625 patient-years of observation.

Hence, we assessed the relationship between glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at 1 year post-HTx and all-cause and cardiac mortality and development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). We evaluated 381 patients with a minimum survival of 1 year post-HTx and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study formula was used to calculate estimated GFR. Mortality and angiographic CAV were defined as separate endpoints, and median follow-up was 7.4 and 4.0 years, respectively. During the follow-up period, 122 patients died and 154 patients developed CAV. Reduced GFR pre-HTx was not a risk factor for either endpoint. Overall, 193 (51%) patients had GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m at one year post-HTx and this was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.7 (P=0.01) for a GFR between 30-60 and 3.2 (P=0.006) for GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m.

Patient survival after heart transplantation has improved dramatically since the availability of calcineurine inhibitor (CNIs); the number of long-term patients is progressively increasing. However, in these patients, nephrotoxicity of CNIs has been largely responsible for the progressive development of renal dysfunction. Since impaired renal function is an important issue that reduces long-term patient survival, it is important to develop strategies to improve renal function while maintaining immunologic safety to preserve graft function. Everolimus is an mTOR inhibitor sirolimus analogue, that has proved, to be highly efficacious to prevent acute myocardial rejection and reduce the severity of cardiac allograft vasculopathy in de novo HTx patients. There is reasonable evidence that, in long term heart transplanted patients, renal function may improve when everolimus is administered associated with a progressive reduction of CNIs. So far there is no evidence to identify which patient may benefit from this therapeutic approach. Indeed everolimus alone may be equally effective to prevent rejection and improve renal function when CNIs are completely discontinued, but data are still lacking on the risks, dosages and side effects of this type of immunosuppression.

Although the univariate study showed that G1 showed a significantly lower early survival rate (84%) than G2 (91%), the multivariate study adjusted for donor and recipient weight and size, urgency level, previous surgery, and age only showed urgency level (odds ratio [OR] 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-5.57; P = .016) and previous surgery (OR 5.8; 95% CI 2.7-12.4; P < .01) to be predictors of early mortality. When baseline characteristics were analyzed, we found that 31% of HT in G1 were urgent versus 18% in G2, and 32% of patients in G1 had previous surgery versus 17% in G2. Donor gender did not appear to negatively affect early survival. In our series, urgent HT in male recipients with a female was more frequent than with a male donor heart. The higher early mortality in male recipients of an urgent HT from a female than from a male donor was attributable to a higher baseline risk profile.

According to previous studies, having been a smoker before heart transplantation (HT) confers a greater likelihood of developing any type of tumor or other complication after HT. Our objective was to determine the impact of having been a smoker before HT on survival, respiratory complications during the postoperative period, and long-term tumor development. After excluding combined transplantations, pediatric transplantations, and retransplantations, we retrospectively reviewed 288 HT performed between November 1987 and September 2006. We divided patients into nonsmokers (including those who quit smoking more than 1 year before HT (n = 163), exsmokers for less than 1 year (n = 76), and those who smoked until HT (n = 49). The statistical tests were chi-square, Student t, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Kaplan-Meier curves. There were more male patients among smokers and exsmokers than nonsmokers (93.9% vs 96.1% vs 82%, respectively; P = .003). There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the groups. Exsmokers remained intubated for a longer time than smokers or nonsmokers (33.4 +/- 44.6 vs 14.2 +/- 7.3 vs 17.9 +/- 19.2, respectively; P = .05). We observed the same trend in recovery unit stay (7.9 +/- 10.5 days vs 4.4 +/- 1.88 days vs 4.84 +/- 3.49 days, respectively; P = .021). The development of any type of tumor was also more frequent among smokers and exsmokers, although not significantly. The survival rate was similar in nonsmokers and exsmokers, although higher than in smokers (89.57 vs 92.11% vs 81.63%, respectively; P = .031). We did not observe differences in the causes of death. Patients who smoke or have smoked until shortly before HT showed a poorer prognosis and a longer recovery unit stay. There was also a trend to increased tumor development.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seronegative recipients of cardiac allografts from CMV-seropositive donors (CMV D(+)/R(-)) are at highest risk of CMV disease after transplantation. This study was conducted to investigate the incidence, clinical features, risk factors and outcome of delayed-onset primary CMV disease in cardiac recipients who received anti-CMV prophylaxis. This study enrolled all CMV D(+)/R(-) cardiac recipients during the period from 2000 to 2004. The medical records of patients were reviewed to assess clinical variables and outcomes. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and survival analysis. During the 5-year study period, a total of 31 cardiac recipients had CMV D(+)/R(-) serostatus (mean age +/- SD: 49.2 +/- 13.7 years; 74% male). All patients received oral ganciclovir (n = 6) or valganciclovir (n = 25) prophylaxis for a median duration of 95 days (interquartile range: 90 to 100). No breakthrough CMV disease was observed. However, 9 (29%) patients developed delayed-onset primary CMV disease (3 with CMV syndrome, 6 with gastrointestinal disease) during the period from 120 to 444 days after transplantation. No demographic or clinical variable was significantly associated with delayed-onset primary CMV disease. However, acute rejection with a severity of Grade >or=2 showed a trend toward association with CMV disease (hazards ratio: 2.46; 95% confidence interval: 0.66 to 9.2; p = 0.18). During the mean (+/-SD) follow-up period of 2.9 (+/-1.68) years, 3 patients died. CMV disease was not associated with all-cause mortality. In the contemporary era of anti-viral prophylaxis, delayed-onset primary CMV disease remains a common complication among CMV D(+)/R(-) cardiac recipients. This finding warrants a better strategy for CMV prevention. ", "label": 1}{"text": "Donor cardiac troponin I levels do not predict recipient survival after cardiac transplantation. Serum levels of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) are frequently measured in the evaluation of potential heart donors. However, the utility of cTnI levels for predicting recipient outcomes remains controversial. This study was performed to determine whether donor cardiac cTnI levels exceeding 1.0 microg/liter are associated with adverse recipient outcomes. All donors managed by the California Transplant Donor Network between January 2001 and July 2002 with consent for donor evaluation and at least 1 measured cTnI level were included in the study if 1-year recipient mortality data were available. Each study subject was classified as having elevated cTnI if any level exceeded 1.0 microg/liter. Donor variables, recipient risk of 30-day and 1-year mortality, and recipient need for mechanical circulatory support were compared between the 2 groups. A total of 263 potential donors were evaluated, and 98 had elevated cTnI levels. Of these potential donors, 139 were accepted for transplantation. The cTnI levels were normal in 96 and elevated in 43. Most donors (77%) with elevated cTnI levels had levels of less than 10 microg/liter. Donor cardiopulmonary resuscitation was associated with cTnI elevations. Donors with elevated cTnI levels did not require higher doses of inotropic drugs before transplantation and had similar hemodynamic profiles compared with donors with normal cTnI levels. Although there was a trend towards longer post-transplant hospitalization in recipients of grafts from donors with elevated cTnI levels (17 days vs 15 days, p = 0.044), there was no significant difference in the recipient need for mechanical circulatory support or 30-day and 1-year mortality between the 2 groups. In this study, a modestly elevated donor cTnI was not associated with a higher risk of recipient mortality or need for post-transplant mechanical circulatory support. A potential donor heart should not be discarded solely because the troponin level is elevated.

A retrospective cohort study of using data reported to the United Network for Organ Sharing/Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (UNOS/OPTN) registry from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2004, was performed. The association between PRA at transplant and primary end points, allograft and patient survival, as well as a secondary end point, rejection within 1 year, was analyzed. Pretransplant PRA was reported for 8,160 (79.4%) of the 10,279 first heart transplant recipients during the study period. Panel-reactive antibody was 0% in 6,481 (79.4%) patients (group 1), 1% to 10% in 930 (11.4%) patients (group 2), 11% to 25% in 309 (3.8%) patients (group 3), and greater than 25% in 440 (5.4%) patients (group 4). Actuarial survival was significantly different among the four groups by Kaplan-Meier method (p < 0.001). Furthermore, using PRA cutoffs of 0%, 10%, or 25%, the group with lower PRA had significantly better patient and allograft survival. Cox proportional hazard modeling revealed increasing PRA as a significant predictor of mortality (p < 0.001). However, when each group (2, 3, and 4) was compared with group 1 (PRA 0%), only group 4 (PRA > 25%) had worse survival on multivariate analysis. Patients with PRA greater than 25% confirmed by the flow cytometric technique had the worst overall survival. Rejection rate within 1 year after transplantation also significantly increased with increasing PRA. Propensity-matched patients demonstrated similar results. This large series of patients from the United Network for Organ Sharing database has demonstrated that elevated PRA remains a significant risk factor in a recent cohort of heart transplant recipients. Patients with PRA greater than 25% are at a particularly high risk. ", "label": 1}{"text": "Heart transplantation in children: clinical outcomes in a single center.

The main indications for heart transplantation were dilated cardiomyopathy (68%) and congenital heart disease (31%). Early mortality risk was 14% +/- 3.6%. Primary graft failure (39%) was the main cause of early death. Total follow-up time was 694 patient-years (mean, 104.1 +/- 42.8 months). Twenty-three patients died during follow-up, resulting in 33 of 1,000 patient-years of late mortality rate. Acute rejection (43%) and allograft vasculopathy (26%) were attributed to late mortality.

The purpose of this article was to report the results of heart transplantations (HTs) carried out in Spain from the first use of the technique until December 2006. A descriptive analysis of all HTs carried out since the first transplant in May 1984 up to December 31, 2006. In total, 5241 transplants have been performed. The majority (94%) were de novo transplants in adults. The percentages of pediatric transplants and retransplants were low, at 4% and 2%, respectively. The percentage of transplants that were combined with lung, kidney or pancreas transplants was also low (2%). The typical clinical profile of a Spanish heart transplant recipient was that of a 52-year-old male who had been diagnosed with nonrevascularizable ischemic heart disease along with severely depressed ventricular function and a poor functional status. The implanted heart was typically from a 34-year-old donor who had died from a head injury. The average waiting time was 125 days. The mean survival time has increased progressively over the years. Whereas for the whole series, the probabilities of survival at 1, 5, 10 and 15 years were 75%, 64%, 51% and 35%, respectively, over the past 5 years, the probabilities of survival at 1 and 5 years were 80% and 75%, respectively.

The first heart transplantation (HTx) in Belgium was performed by us at university hospital Brugmann on August 23, 1973. At this time, organ procurement was still a sensitive procedure not regulated as well as it is nowadays. Among other difficulties, diagnosis of rejection after the operation was only based upon clinical signs and electrocardiographic voltage variations. Echocardiography did not exist yet and endocardiac biopsy was unknown. Moreover the variety of immunosuppressive drugs was scarce and their potency far from what we are used to in the present era. Three patients were transplanted with excellent immediate survival but nevertheless the first died after six months from an acute broncho-pulmonary infection ; the second after one year of an ongoing chronic rejection and the third after two weeks of an acute rejection. Deeply frustrated by these unrewarding results alltogether for the patients and the doctors, it was decided to stop the programme until new progress would allow early and objective diagnosis of rejection and provide access to more potent immunosuppressive drugs. This became a reality in 1981 with the release of ciclosporine and the introduction in clinical practice of transvenous endocardiac biopsy to diagnose rejection and to monitor the outcome of its treatment further on. Those two opportunities were a major breaktrough for HTx which knew a spectacular revival worldwide. Ciclosporine arrived in Belgium in 1982 and we soon restarted HTx at Erasme Hospital. Comparing our results of HTx in the pre-ciclosporine period with the ones in the current era is striking. The cumulative 25 years experience of HTx at Erasme is briefly alluded to.

The cost-effectiveness of everolimus and MMF versus azathioprine was assessed to 6 months posttransplantation. The evaluation was performed from the German health insurance payer perspective. The composite efficacy endpoint in the everolimus trial was death, graft loss/retransplantation, biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) grade>or=3A, rejection with hemodynamic compromise, and loss to follow-up. The composite endpoint in the MMF trial included only death, retransplantation, and BPAR with hemodynamic compromise. To mimic the everolimus endpoint, an estimated number of patients with BPAR>or=3A was added to the MMF trial results, using two mapping scenarios.

We identified 26 fetal listings (of 269 total listings). Diagnoses included congenital heart disease (n = 24) and cardiomyopathy (n = 2). Seven patients were delisted after birth: in five cases parents opted for surgical palliation, two clinically improved. One patient died wait-listed (stillborn). Time wait-listed as a fetus ranged from 1-41 days (median 19 days). Eighteen patients underwent HTx (median weight 2.8 kg, range 2.1-10.9 kg); median days wait-listed after birth was 22 (4 h-123 days). Two fetuses were surgically delivered at 36 weeks gestation when a donor organ became available; 11 were transplanted as neonates (<30 days). The median age at HTx was 1 month (4 h-2.6 months). Fetal listing for HTx increases the potential window of opportunity for a donor organ to become available; patients had low wait-list mortality and a fair intermediate-term outcome. Well-defined criteria for eligibility for fetal listing and priority allocation to infants over fetuses seem rational approaches for centers that offer fetal listing.

The increase in time waiting for appropriate pediatric allografts for heart transplantation has mandated the use of long-term mechanical assistance in the pediatric population. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support has been routinely used but is limited by both its inability to provide support without life-threatening complications for longer than 2 to 3 weeks as well as the inability of patients to achieve mobility. For the past 10 years, pediatric programs have increasing experience with the use of ventricular assist devices (VADs) to bridge patients to heart transplant. This retrospective study analyzed the clinical features and outcomes of 99 pediatric patients who underwent VAD implant as a bridge to heart transplant. Between 1993 and 2003, the Pediatric Heart Transplant Study Group enrolled 2,375 patients (age 1 day-17.9 years) listed for heart transplant from 23 participating centers. Four percent (99 patients) of those listed received VAD support as a bridge to transplantation. Seventy-seven (77%) patients survived to transplant with a mean time on support of 57 days. There were 17 deaths on support and 5 bridged to recovery. Overall incidence of adverse events was similar to the adult data with a 19% risk of stroke. There was no difference in 5-year survival after transplant for patients on VAD at time of transplant compared with those (n = 2,293) not requiring VAD (77% vs 73%, P = .8). These data suggest that despite the lack of pediatric specific devices and relatively high adverse event rate, VADs may be used as a bridge to transplant therapy in appropriate-sized children with the expectation of a successful outcome in most patients.

Studies of high-risk pediatric cardiac transplant recipients are lacking. The purpose of this study is to evaluate early posttransplant survival in high-risk pediatric patients. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) provided de-identified patient-level data. The study population included 3502 recipients aged less than 21 years who underwent transplantation from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2005. Recipients were stratified on the basis of the presence or absence of high-risk criteria: pulmonary vascular resistance index greater than 6 Wood units/m2 (n = 285, 8.1%), creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min (308, 8.8%), hepatitis C positivity (33, 0.9%), donor/recipient weight ratio less than 0.7 (80, 2.3%), panel reactive antibody greater than 40% (235, 6.7%), retransplantation (235, 6.7%), and age less than 1 year old (840, 24.0%). Overall, 1575 (45.0%) patients met at least one high-risk criterion. Higher numbers of high-risk criteria in a patient were correlated with increased 30-day mortality (0 high-risk criteria: 5.2%; 1 criterion: 7.9%; 2 criteria: 12.9%; and 3 or more criteria: 25.0%; P < .0001) and poor long-term survival (P < .0001). Among patients with high-risk criteria, a simplified scoring scale accurately predicts both 30-day and contingent 1-year mortality (P < .0001). Individually, the effect of high-risk criteria on posttransplant survival varied; however, increasing numbers of criteria in a patient resulted in a cumulative increase in mortality. A scoring scale allows for the prediction of approximate mortality rates after transplantation. These findings suggest that recipient criteria for transplantation should focus on the number of high-risk criteria as well as clinical status, rather than the presence or absence of a single risk factor.

Calcineurin-inhibitor therapy can lead to renal dysfunction in heart transplantation patients. The novel immunosuppressive (IS) drug sirolmus (Srl) lacks nephrotoxic effects; however, proteinuria associated with Srl has been reported following renal transplantation. In cardiac transplantation, the incidence of proteinuria associated with Srl is unknown. In this study, long-term cardiac transplant patients were switched from cyclosporine to Srl-based IS. Concomitant IS consisted of mycophenolate mofetil +/- steroids. Proteinuria increased significantly from a median of 0.13 g/day (range 0-5.7) preswitch to 0.23 g/day (0-9.88) at 24 months postswitch (p = 0.0024). Before the switch, 11.5% of patients had high-grade proteinuria (>1.0 g/day); this increased to 22.9% postswitch (p = 0.006). ACE inhibitor and angiotensin-releasing blocker (ARB) therapy reduced proteinuria development. Patients without proteinuria had increased renal function (median 42.5 vs. 64.1, p = 0.25), whereas patients who developed high-grade proteinuria showed decreased renal function at the end of follow-up (median 39.6 vs. 29.2, p = 0.125).

Cardiac transplantation is an important treatment option that increases the survival and decreases the limitations in effort capacity among patients with end-stage heart disease. In this study we have presented the midterm results of 13 patients who underwent cardiac transplantation between 2003 and 2007. There were 10 male and three female patients of mean age of 32 +/- 13.27 years (12 to 54). In one patient, we performed combined cardiac and renal transplantation. Ischemic cardiac disease was present in six patients and cardiomyopathy in seven patients. The mean age of the donors was 23.3 +/- 11.8 years (12 to 46). Corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil were used for immunosuppression. Sirolimus was employed in five cases due to impaired renal function. Patients were followed by echocardiography, endomyocardial biopsy, and dobutamine stress echocardiography. The mean follow-up was 18.6 +/- 13.4 (1 to 38) months. In four patients, there was grade IIIA (II-R) rejection. In five patients, tacrolimus or cyclosporine was replaced with sirolimus due to elevated creatinine levels. Dobutamine stress echocardiography was positive in one patient, who displayed a severe left main coronary artery lesion. There was no operative mortality. There was only one hospital mortality (7.6%). Two patients died in the midterm. The overall mortality on follow-up was 3 (23.1%).

Five patients received support with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and 3 with a biventricular device (BiVAD). Duration of support ranged from 2 to 234 days (median 57 days). Five patients (63%) were successfully bridged to transplantation; of these, 4 were discharged home and 1 died from early graft failure. Five patients developed post-operative neurologic events. Of these 5 events, 4 could be explained by embolism or hemorrhage. Device exchange was performed in 4 patients in the intensive care unit. In selected children, the Berlin Heart VAD can be used as a bridge to transplantation. In contrast to the published European experience, neurologic events occur frequently.

Despite 40 years of heart transplantation, the optimal atrial anastomotic technique remains unclear. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database provides a unique and novel opportunity to address this question by examining survival in a large cohort of patients undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). We hypothesized that, when examining the issue on a large scale, no difference in survival would exist between techniques. We retrospectively reviewed first-time adult OHT in the UNOS database to identify 14,418 patients undergoing OHT between the years 1999 and 2005. Primary stratification was between those who underwent bicaval vs biatrial techniques. Baseline demographic and clinical factors were also recorded. The primary end-point was mortality from all causes during the study period. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay (LOS), and need for permanent pacemaker placement (PP). Post-transplant survival was compared between groups using a Cox proportional hazard regression model. Of the 11,931 patients who met inclusion criteria between 1999 and 2005, 5,207 (44%) underwent the bicaval anastomotic technique. Bicaval and biatrial groups were well matched for gender, donor age, ischemic time, pulmonary vascular resistance, transpulmonary gradient, cardiac index, body mass index and pre-operative creatinine. Technique was not associated with survival during the study period (hazard ratio 1.06, p = 0.31). On multivariate analysis, age, gender, donor age and ischemic time were independent predictors of mortality. The bicaval technique was associated with less need for post-operative PP (2.0% vs 5.3%, p < 0.001) and shorter LOS (19 vs 21 days, p < 0.001). This study is the single largest series examining bicaval vs biatrial anastamotic techniques for OHT.

As these studies may lack significant power to draw meaningful conclusions, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database provides a unique opportunity to examine the effects of age on OHT. We retrospectively reviewed the UNOS dataset to identify 14,401 first-time OHT recipients between the years 1999 and 2006. Stratification was by age into those >or=60 years and younger patients aged 18 to 59 years. Baseline demographic and clinical factors were recorded. The primary end-point was all-cause mortality during the study period. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay (LOS), post-operative stroke, post-operative infections, acute renal failure (ARF) and rejection within 1 year of transplant. Post-transplant survival was modeled using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between groups using Cox proportional hazard regression. Of the 14,401 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 30% (n = 4,273) were >or=60 years of age.

Survival at 30 days, 1 year and 5 years was 94%, 87% and 75% for the young group, and 93%, 84% and 69% for the older group (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed age >or=60 years, donor age, ischemic time, creatinine, HTN and DM to be independent predictors of mortality. Older patients had more infections (26% vs 23%, p < 0.001), ARF (9% vs 7%, p < 0.001) and longer LOS (21 vs 19 days, p < 0.001), but had lower rates of rejection (34% vs 43%, p < 0.001) as compared with younger recipients. The UNOS database has provided a large multi-institutional sample examining OHT in the elderly. Although our analysis shows lower survival in patients >or=60 years of age, the cumulative 5-year survival in these patients of close to 70% is acceptable.

In a multicenter, open-label, single-arm pilot study, concentration-controlled everolimus was initiated in patients receiving CsA microemulsion (Neoral) with/without mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or azathioprine, and with/without corticosteroids. On the day of everolimus initiation, MMF/azathioprine was discontinued and CsA dose was reduced by 25% with further reductions as required in response to decreasing calculated glomerular filtration rate (cGFR).

From 1985 to 2007, 212 patients (mean age 53+/-11 years) with refractory heart failure (LVEF=22+/-9%, mean NYHA 3.2) underwent CMP in France. Heart transplantation was performed in 26 patients (12.3%), mean age: 51+/-11 years, within 2.3+/-3 years after CMP. Transplantation was indicated for persistent heart failure, i.e. no immediate improvement after CMP (19%) and for recurring heart failure (81%). The surgical technique of heart transplantation following cardiomyoplasty presents few particularities. Routine extracorporeal bypass was instituted between the vena cavas and the ascending aorta. As in most of these patients the CMP procedure had been performed without the need of extracorporeal circulation, hearts were free of previous cannulations for cardiopulmonary bypass. The latissimus dorsi muscle flap was divided as far as possible inside the left pleural cavity and its vascular pedicle was obturated. The proximal portion of the muscle as well as the muscular pacing electrodes were kept in place in the pleural cavity. The adhesions between the flap and the heart were not released so as to achieve an en bloc resection of the heart and the muscle flap. During removal of the recipient's heart, care was taken not to injure the left phrenic nerve that was frequently in tight relation with the latissimus dorsi muscle. Heart transplantation was then performed in a routine manner, the donor heart being anastomosed to remnant atria and great vessels. Mean follow-up was 5.5 years (longest 13.5 years). Survival at 10 years was 40% for early heart transplantation (done within 4 months of CMP) and 57% for transplantation performed at 3+/-2.8 years after CMP. Heart transplantation after CMP is technically feasible. Hospital mortality was higher when urgent transplantation was required.

We retrospectively analyzed survival, causes of death and the development of graft coronary artery disease (GCAD) with respect to the number of positive and negative cotinine levels. One hundred four of 380 (27.4%) patients tested positive for active smoking at some point posttransplant, and 57 (15.0%) tested positive repeatedly.

In HT recipients, age did not retain significance at multivariate analysis as an independent predictor (p > or = 0.14 for both all-cause and cardiovascular death), whereas ischemic etiology of pre-existing CHF did (p < or = 0.02). Age did not appear to be a primary determinant of all-cause or cardiovascular mortality among potential HT candidates or eventual recipients (ischemic etiology of CHF turned out to be the major determinant of post-transplant outcome).

Allograft rejection continues to be one of the most common causes of mortality after heart transplantation. We investigated if perioperative use of antifibrinolytics such as aprotinin and tranexamic acid can decrease the rate of rejection after heart transplant and their effect on transfusion. A retrospective analysis was conducted on the data from patients who received a first heart transplant at Papworth Hospital between 2000 and 2005. Transplant registry and audit data were used for the study. Rejection biopsy results and treatment were used to designate rejection episodes as mild (grades 1A, 1B or 2 untreated) or severe (grades 2 treated, grades 3 and 4). The relationship between antifibrinolytics and rejection episodes was assessed using univariate and multiple Poisson regression. Kaplan-Meier methods and Kruskal-Wallis tests, respectively, were used to analyse survival/time to first rejection and transfusion. There were 225 patients who underwent a first heart transplant between January 2000 and December 2005. Of these, 101 patients (44.9%) had received aprotinin, 63 (28.0%) tranexamic acid, 2 (0.9%) both (aprotinin and tranexamic acid) and 59 (26.2%) no antifibrinolytics. There was no difference in time to first rejection by antifibrinolytic treatment (p=0.20). There was no difference in the rate of treated rejection per 100 patient-days between aprotinin and tranexamic acid groups between 0 and 3 months post-transplant, (0.6 in both), but aprotinin had a small clinical effect when compared to no treatment (0.6 vs 0.8, p=0.54). Between 4 and 6 months, the treated and severe rejection rates were lower in the patients receiving aprotinin as compared to those receiving tranexamic acid, but these differences again did not reach statistical significance (0.1 vs 0.3, p=0.14, 0.2 vs 0.4, p=0.18). Aprotinin was associated with higher postoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements in the subgroup of patients that had a ventricular assist device, prior sternotomy or anticoagulant therapy.

The experience of a patient in a survival study may be modelled as a process with two states and one possible transition from an \"alive\" state to a \"dead\" state. In some studies, however, the \"alive\" state may be partitioned into two or more intermediate (transient) states, each of which corresponding to a particular stage of the illness. In such studies, multi-state models can be used to model the movement of patients among the various states. In these models issues, of interest include the estimation of progression rates, assessing the effects of individual risk factors, survival rates or prognostic forecasting. In this article, we review modelling approaches for multi-state models, and we focus on the estimation of quantities such as the transition probabilities and survival probabilities. Differences between these approaches are discussed, focussing on possible advantages and disadvantages for each method. We also review the existing software currently available to fit the various models and present new software developed in the form of an R library to analyse such models. Different approaches and software are illustrated using data from the Stanford heart transplant study and data from a study on breast cancer conducted in Galicia, Spain.

We analyzed results for 182 patients aged 62 to 75 years (mean +/- SD: 66.3 +/- 11.4 years) who underwent heart transplantation between January 1995 and July 2001 at a single institution. They were compared with a control group of 348 contemporaneous adult recipients aged 18 to 62 years (mean +/- SD: 48.2 +/- 11.4 years). All recipients in this consecutive cohort had a follow-up of at least at least 5 years. End-points studied were Kaplan-Meier survival, freedom from dialysis and freedom from malignancy at 100 months. Follow-up was 100% at 100 months. At 100 months, survival for the elderly was 55% (46 remaining at risk) and 63% (102 remaining at risk) for controls (p = 0.051, log-rank test).

Although long-term survival of older heart transplant recipients is acceptable, it is significantly lower than in young recipients. The increased risk of renal failure and malignancy among elderly patients likely influences the difference in survival observed between the two groups. Pre-operative renal function warrants careful consideration. As ventricular assist device technology improves, it may be used to complement heart transplantation to avoid immunosuppression and its side effect of malignancy in older patients with advanced heart failure.

Superimposed acute right ventricular dysfunction in the setting of preexisting pulmonary hypertension is a nearly fatal complication after heart transplantation. The optimal treatment modality remains a matter of debate. Recently, sildenafil citrate, a nonselective pulmonary vasodilator, has gained popularity in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in transplant candidates. Herein we have presented a series of 13 patients in whom sildenafil was used to treat right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension as detected by transesophageal echocardiography and Swan-Ganz right heart catheterization after heart transplant. Their characteristics were mean age 49+/-11.4 years; 38.4% with previous cardiac procedures, 30.8% status I, basal pulmonary vascular resistance index 10.4+/-4.6 WoodU, mean transpulmonary gradient 18.7+/-5.4 mmHg. In addition to conventional inodilator support, we administered 1 to 3 mg per kilogram of sildenafil. Complete hemodynamic measurements were obtained before and after the institution of the therapy and at 1-month follow-up. Within the first 72 hours, acute right ventricular dysfunction resolved in all cases without untoward side effects or significant systemic impact. Sildenafil significantly decreased the transpulmonary gradient and pulmonary vascular resistance index relative to baseline values; 5.6+/-1.82 versus 10.4+/-4.6 WU, (P< .05), 13.5+/-3.4 mm Hg versus 18.7+/-5.4 mm Hg (P< .05), respectively.

Heart transplantation was performed firstly in 1967, but it became a valuable option in the 1980s, due to the availability of cyclosporine and of the technique for rejection monitoring by means of serial endomyocardial biopsies. Post-transplant survival improved over the years, mainly due to a reduction in early mortality for infection or acute rejection. Expected 1-year and 5-year survivals are around 85% and 70%, respectively. During the past 20-30 years, better therapies for heart failure have been developed, leading to restriction of heart transplant candidacy to truly refractory heart failure. On the contrary, the criteria for donor acceptance have been liberalized, due to the discrepancy between heart transplant candidates and available organs. It must be kept in mind that renal and/or hepatic insufficiency that may be a consequence of heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and donor age, all remain risk factors for mortality after transplantation. In order to maintain and possibly improve the results of heart transplantation, effective strategies to increase safely the donor pool are of utmost importance. Moreover, long-term post-transplant recipients present new challenges to research and clinical practice. Mechanical circulatory support devices represent a surgical bridge or an alternative to transplantation; their expansion is limited by costs, organizational burden, and by patient difficulties in accepting this therapy.

Among them 41 patients received cardiac retransplantation, 18 patients because of acute graft failure and 23 because of chronic graft failure. Data were analyzed for demographics, morbidity and risk factors for mortality. The acute and chronic retransplant group was compared to those patients undergoing primary transplantation. The mean interval between primary transplantation and retransplantation was 1.9 days in the acute and 6.7 years in the chronic retransplant group. Mean follow-up was 6.9 years. Baseline characteristics were similar in the primary and retransplant group. Actuarial survival rates at 1, 3, 5 and 7 years after primary cardiac transplantation compared to retransplantation were 83, 78, 72 and 64% vs 53, 50, 47 and 36%, respectively (p<0.001). Early mortality after acute retransplantation was significantly higher compared to late retransplantation (10/18, 55.6% vs 4/23, 17.4%, p=0.011). Major causes of death were acute and chronic rejection, infection and sepsis. Cardiac retransplantation is associated with lower survival rates compared to primary transplantation. However, results after retransplantation in chronic graft failure are significantly better compared to acute graft failure. Therefore, we consider cardiac retransplantation in chronic graft failure a justified therapeutic option. In contrast, patients with acute graft failure seem to be inappropriate candidates for cardiac retransplantation.

We reviewed UNOS data (years 1999 to 2006) identifying 14,401 first-time adult OHTs conducted at 143 centers. Stratification was by mean annual institution volume. Primary outcomes of 30-day and 1-year mortality were assessed by multivariable logistic regression (adjusted for comorbidities and risk factors for death). Sequential volume cutoffs were examined to determine if current CMS standards are optimal. Pseudo R2 and area under the receiver operating curve assessed goodness of fit. Mean annual volume ranged from 1 to 90. One-year mortality was 12.6% (n = 1,800). Increased center volume was associated with decreased 30-day mortality (p < 0.001). Decreased center volume was associated with increases in 30-day (odds ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02 to 1.03, p < 0.001) and 1-year mortality (OR 1.01, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.02, p = 0.03--censored for 30-day death). The greatest mortality risk occurred at very low volume centers (<or= 2 cases = 2.15 times increase in death, p = 0.03). Annual institutional volume of fewer than 10 cases per year increased 30-day mortality by more than 100% (OR 2.02, 95%CI: 1.46 to 2.80, p < 0.001) and each decrease in mean center volume by one case per year increased the odds of 30-day mortality by 2% (OR 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.03, p < 0.001].

Left ventricular assist devices were used pretransplant in 23 of these 317 patients, and 294 patients did not require left ventricular assist device support. Patients with a left ventricular assist device were supported with a Heartmate VE or Heartmate XVE (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, Calif). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were compared between the left ventricular assist device group and the non-left ventricular assist device group using the log-rank test.

By improving short and long-term survivals, cardiac transplantation would be a more realistic curative treatment modality. The aim of this study was to evaluate factors associated with the long-term survival following cardiac transplantations in our center. Forty-four patients were operated on cardiac transplantation between 1989 and November 2006. The study was designed in a retrospective manner and all data were collected from hospital records. Our study population consisted of 16 patients (Group A) who survived >1 month, but died <2 years after cardiac transplantation and 17 patients (Group B) who survived more than 2 years. All patients had triple immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporine, azathioprine, corticosteroid). Statistical analyses were performed using Fischer's exact and Mann Whitney U tests, and multivariate regression analysis. Survival was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Group B patients had lower pre-transplant creatinine levels (0.93+/-0.28 mg/dl vs. 1.16+/-0.21 mg/dl, p=0.033) younger donor age (24.5+/-6.3 years vs. 30.1+/-8.1 years, p=0.017) and more male donors (82.3% vs. 50%, p=0.05) as compared with Group A patients. The perioperative and follow-up analysis showed that patients with long-term survival had shorter ischemic time (141.5+/-33.2 min vs. 182.5+/-49.2 min, p=0.007), aortic cross clamp time (65.9+/-10.2 min vs. 83.6+/-7.9 min, p<0.001), less amount of blood transfusion (3.4+/-1.6 units vs. 5.0+/-1.5 units, p=0.01), better NYHA status after operation (1+/-0 vs. 1.63+/-0.72, p=0.014) and less frequent acute rejection episodes (11.8% vs. 68.8%, p<0.001) than those with short-term survival after operation. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed higher preoperative creatinine level (HR=42.6, 95% CI 4.67-388.21, p=0.001), acute rejection (HR=4.45, 95% 1.44-13.77, p=0.01), early postoperative functional status (HR=4.84, 95% CI 1.9-12.27, p=0.001) and unsatisfactory rejection surveillance protocol in the first 6 months after transplantation (HR=0.2, 95% CI 0.07-0.67, p=0.008) were prominent factors associated with the long-term survival. The availability of the donor hearts from younger male donors with the shortest ischemic times is identified as the most significant factor improving long-term survival.

All patients received immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine or tacrolimus, azathioprine, steroids and mycophenolate mofetil. Lymphocyte was administrated by 3-7 days course of either rabbit antithymocyte globulins or anti-lymphocyte globulins or by a 14 days course of OKT3.

Fifty-two coronary artery lesions were treated during 42 percutaneous transluminal cardioangioplasty (PTCA)/stent procedures in 36 patients. Mean time since heart transplantation to PTCA was 80 +/- 27 months. Indication to PTCA was asymptomatic angiographic graft vasculopathy in 34 patients (94%) and acute myocardial infarction in 2 patients (6%). PTCA was performed on left anterior descending artery in 34 cases (65.4%), on circumflex artery in 10 cases (19.2%), on right coronary artery in 8 cases (15.4%). There were no procedure related deaths. None of the patients required emergency bypass surgery. Two patients had transient acute renal failure.

ABO-incompatible heart transplantation, traditionally contraindicated because of the risk of hyperacute rejection, has been used selectively in recent years. Infants have limited production of isohemagglutinins, which may lower the risk of hyperacute rejection. A large national database was used to analyze the effect of ABO incompatibility on outcomes after heart transplantation in infants. Heart transplant recipients aged younger than 1 year reported to the United Network for Organ Sharing from 1999 to 2007 were divided according to donor-recipient ABO incompatibility or compatibility. Outcomes included Kaplan-Meier survival and hyperacute rejection. Propensity-adjusted Cox regression modeling was used to identify predictors of mortality. Of 591 infants that underwent heart transplantation, 35 (6%) received allografts from ABO-incompatible donors. ABO-incompatible recipients trended toward more congenital heart disease (71% vs 66%; p = 0.06) and were less likely to have dilated cardiomyopathy (11% vs 29%; p = 0.02). One ABO-incompatible infant had hyperacute rejection requiring retransplantation. No ABO-incompatible infant and 2 ABO-compatible infants died from hyperacute rejection. Survival was similar at 3 years. Propensity-adjusted Cox regression analysis demonstrated that ABO-incompatibility did not predict mortality (hazard ratio, 3.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-49.0; p = 0.33). ABO-incompatible heart transplantation can be performed safely in infants without greater incidence of hyperacute rejection. ABO-incompatible heart transplantation should be strongly considered in infants to maximize donor organ utilization and reduce waiting-list mortality.

Those patients who received VAD or urgent HTx (decompensated) were assigned to Group D-97 (n = 108) and Group D-01 (n = 307) under the old and new algorithm, respectively, and regarded as critically ill. We defined subgroups of critically ill patients as follows: Group VAD-97 (n = 92) and Group VAD-01 (n = 184), who underwent primary VAD implantation under the old and new allocation algorithm, respectively; and Group UTx-97 (n = 16) and Group UTx-01 (n = 123), who underwent urgent HTx under the old and new algorithm.

After many years, heart transplantation is still the most accepted treatment for end-stage heart disease. A heart transplantation program was started at our hospital in December 1987 as the first intrathoracic organ transplantation in Southeast Asia. Herein, we have reviewed our 20 years of experience from 1987 to 2007. We followed every individual within our 52-patient cohort for up to 20 years. Three eras were studied: 1987 to 1995, 1996 to 2002, and 2003 to 2007. End points were survival, rejection, infection event, and graft coronary artery disease (CAD). There were 52 patients (39 males and 12 females). The mean age was 41.7 years (range, 12-23 years). Perioperative mortality (within 1 month) was 13.4% (n = 7) due to graft failure (n = 2), rejection (n = 3), infection (n = 1), on pulmonary hypertension (n = 1). Medium-term mortality (1-12 months) was 30.7% (n = 16) due to rejection (n = 8), infection (n = 7), or CAD (n = 1). After 1 year causes of death were rejection (n = 4), infection (n = 4), renal failure (n = 2), or CAD (n = 1). Overall actuarial 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates for all recipients were 54.7%, 43.3%, and 32.5%, respectively. The first patient in this series is still alive. For the period 2003 to 2007, actuarial 1-year and 4-year survival rates for all recipients were both 77.8%. The rate of rejection was reduced to just one event during this period. All surviving patients were NYHA Functional class I and II; 86% went back to work, leading almost normal lives.

Patients in the NCT group were in worse condition at HT, with a greater percentage of inotropic treatments pre-HT (36% vs 17%; P = .005), emergency transplants procedures (30% vs 13%; P = .01), and worse functional status pre-HT (P = .03). The NCT group exhibited lower survival (80.37% vs 87.04%; P = 0.13, log-rank test). There were no significant differences in the other analyzed variables. Patients included in CTs tend to have better long-term survival rates, for several reasons: patients in the CT group were more stable at HT (selection bias), and the close follow-up of patients in CTs makes it more likely that any complication will be detected and treated early (follow-up bias).

The aims of our study were to determine the incidence and factors that determine the appearance of posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) and its prognostic value. We performed a retrospective study of all heart transplant recipients in our hospital from January 1993 to December 2005, including 116 patients with prolonged monitoring with 59-month median follow-up. We divided the patients into two groups, according to whether they had de novo diabetes (group 1) or no diabetes (group 2). Patients with PTDM were significantly older, with a median difference (MD) of 5.4 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.53-9.28) and a greater body mass index (MD, 3.37 kg/m(2); 95% CI, 1.68-5.06). Moreover, a greater percentage of patients in group 1 had ischemia compared to other etiologies. However, no significant differences were observed regarding other cardiovascular risk factors. PTDM was associated with a greater incidence of posttransplant hypertension (51.6% in group 1 vs 48.4% in group 2, P = .08) and posttransplant renal failure (59.5% in group 1 vs 40.5% in group 2, P = .001). However, no differences were observed in overall survival. Age, overweight, and ischemic origin of cardiopathy were the main risk factors for the development of PTDM in our population. Although no differences were observed in survival rates, PTDM was associated with a greater incidence of hypertension and renal insufficiency, which may have long-term influences on patient survival.

Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the leading cause of death heart transplant (HT) recipients after the first year. We assessed the influence of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) in HT recipients on the development of CAV after 1 year of follow-up. From 2001 to 2005, we studied 72 patients who received a HT and survived for at least 1 years. All patients underwent coronary arteriography and intravascular ultrasonography at 1 year after HT. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy was defined as intimal proliferation of 0.5 mm or more. The analyzed CVRFs were age, sex, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking. We also considered the heart disease that was the reason for HT. The statistical tests used in the univariate analysis were the t and chi(2) tests. Logistic regression was performed with the variables obtained at univariate analysis. Mean (SD) recipient age at HT was 51 (9) years. Eighty patients (90.5%) were men. Dyslipidemia was significantly associated with a greater incidence of CAV at 1 year (68.3% vs 41.9%; P = .03). Ischemia, as opposed to all other causes, was also significantly associated with CAV (69.4% vs 44.4%; P = .03). Older age, hypertension, smoking history, and high body mass index were associated with a higher incidence of CAV, albeit without statistical significance. At multivariate analysis, dyslipidemia was the most significant CVRF (P = .045) for the development of CAV. Recipient dyslipidemia is a risk factor for the development of CAV in HT. The remaining traditional CVRFs are more weakly associated with CAV. After HT close monitoring of recipients with pretransplantation CVRFs is essential for early detection of CAV.

The limited availability of donor organs creates a need for more effective management of heart disease when bridging a patient to cardiac transplant. Inotropic therapy is becoming more commonly used long term to maintain baseline function. The effectiveness and complications associated with their use have not been fully evaluated, and indications for mechanical versus medical therapy as a bridge have not been delineated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of milrinone as a bridge to transplant. This was a retrospective study of 60 patients listed for a cardiac transplant and committed to home intravenous milrinone therapy. A subgroup of patients who eventually progressed to the use of a ventricular assist device were analyzed. Complications and survivals were analyzed for each group. Forty-six patients (76%) were successfully bridged to transplant with milrinone alone, and 14 patients' (24%) conditions deteriorated and required a left ventricular assist device (LVAD); 1-year survivals were 83% and 71%, respectively. The mean waiting time was 59.5 days (9-257 days) for patients receiving milrinone who did not require an LVAD and 112 days (24-270 days) for those whose conditions deteriorated to require an LVAD. This study suggests that chronic intravenous milrinone provides an adequate strategy as a bridge to transplant if the waiting time is short (<100 days), whereas an elective ventricular assist device implantation may be a safer strategy for patients expected to wait longer. These data provide the basis for a prospective evaluation of inotrope versus LVAD as a bridge to transplantation.

Between July 1986 and July 2006, 39 adult patients who underwent heart and lung transplantation performed with organs from cadaveric donors with bacterial meningitis were retrospectively studied. Donors and recipients were identified by a prospectively kept database. Bacterial meningitis was identified either with positive blood or cerebrospinal fluid culture and positive signs and symptoms. All patients had one or more of these criteria. There were 15 heart, 12 lung (4 bilateral), and 12 heart-lung transplants. All donors had identified pathogens: Neisseria meningitidis (n = 21; 53.8%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 16; 41%), and Haemophilus influenzae (n = 2; 5.2%). Adequate antimicrobial therapy before organ retrieval and after transplant was administered. The hospital mortality was 10.2% (n = 4). There were no infectious complications caused by meningeal pathogens. Other causes of hospital mortality were rejection (n = 2), intracranial bleeding (n = 1), and staphylococcus sepsis (n = 1).

In the absence of randomized trials comparing heart transplantation (HTx) with medical therapy for the treatment of advanced heart failure (HF), the role of HTx remains uncertain.

Two thousand two hundred nineteen adults listed for HTx from April 1995 to October 2003 and followed to June 2007 were analyzed. In a substudy of 627 patients from two centers, ambulatory patients were risk-stratified by the heart failure survival score. A time-dependent nonproportional hazards model was used to estimate the effect of HTx. Fourteen percent of patients were nonambulatory at listing. Death while waiting was higher among nonambulatory patients (19% vs. 14% in the ambulatory group, P<0.001 with 76% vs. 71% being transplanted). Posttransplant survival to 3 years was 78% and 75% in nonambulatory and ambulatory groups, respectively (P=0.68). HTx was found to benefit all groups. For nonambulatory patients, the risk of dying after HTx fell below the risk of dying while waiting after 10 days (95% CI 2-18) with a net survival benefit after 26 days (95% CI 5-53); for the ambulatory group the estimates were 42 days (95% CI 36-47) and 274 days (95% CI 214-359), respectively.

We report the renal graft outcomes among a series of patients who underwent simultaneous combined liver-kidney transplantations (CLKT) or heart-kidney transplantations (CHKT) at a single center. From 1975 to December 31, 2007, we performed 1524 kidney transplantations, 427 liver transplantations, and 483 heart transplantations, including 7 simultaneous CLKT and 2 CHKT. We analysed the main patient characteristics, renal graft outcomes, and patient survivals. CLKT indications were as follows: alcoholic cirrhosis (n = 5) and hepatitis C virus (n = 2) with chronic glomerulonephritis (n = 5), hypertensive nephropathy (n = 1), and polycystic disease (n = 1). Cold renal ischemia time was 6.9 hours (range, 6-9). In 5 patients there were no kidney rejection episodes; 3 of these patients are alive with creatinine levels between 1.4 and 1.7 mg/dL with an average follow-up of 6.9 years (range, 10 months-8 years). One patient died of esophageal cancer at 13 years after transplantation with a serum creatinine level of 1.16 mg/dL and another died of breast cancer at 7 years after transplantation with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. One patient lost his renal graft just after the kidney transplantation due to renal vein thrombosis. The last patient suffered 1 episode of acute rejection and lost his kidney 5 years later due to chronic rejection. CHKT indications were as follow: dilated myocardiopathy (n = 2) and chronic glomerulonephritis (n = 1) or interstitial nephropathy (n = 1). The cold renal ischemia time was 4 hours.

The groups were similar in preoperative characteristics. There were fewer donor-recipient race matches in blacks compared with whites (10 versus 71; p < 0.0001). Although 30-day and 6-month graft survival was similar for black and white recipients (93.9% and 85.8% versus 93.3% and 83.3%, respectively), overall actuarial graft survival was significantly lower in blacks (p < 0.019). Blacks tended to have a higher incidence of positive retrospective crossmatch (n = 26, 43%) than whites (n = 29, 29%), but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.053). The median graft survival for black recipients was 5.5 years compared with 11.6 years for whites.

The median graft survival for donor-recipient race-matched patients was more than twice that for mismatched patients (11.6 years versus 4.4 years). Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that donor-recipient race mismatch neutralized the effect of race on graft survival. Graft survival after pediatric heart transplantation is inferior for black recipients compared with white recipients. These differences may be explained by a high incidence of donor-recipient race mismatch, which also predicts poorer outcome for all racial groups with pediatric heart transplantation.

INTERMACS is a registry of FDA-approved durable mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices used for the strategies of destination therapy (DT) and bridge to transplantation (BTT) or recovery. This study identifies predictors for death and transplantation based on initial results from INTERMACS. From June 23, 2006 to December 31, 2007, 420 patients from 75 institutions were prospectively entered into the INTERMACS database in which pre-implant data, indication for MCS device use, adverse events, demographics, hemodynamics, laboratory values and outcomes were recorded. Using competing outcomes methodology, risk factors were identified for the events of death and transplantation. The devices included 314 left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), 5 right VADs (RVADs), 77 biventricular VADs (biVADs) and 24 total artificial hearts (TAHs) for a total of 497 pumps in 420 patients.

Cardiogenic shock, advanced age and severe right heart failure manifested as ascites or increased bilirubin are risk factors for death after MCS therapy. BTT patients who require biVAD support have a transplant rate similar to that of LVAD-only patients, but their mortality at 6 and 12 months exceeds that of LVAD-only patients.

Yet, the extent of histologic and immunofluorescence (IF) findings of AMR varies across endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs). In this study, we hypothesized that the severity of AMR, as assessed on EMBs, correlates with cardiovascular mortality in heart transplant recipients. All EMBs from 1985 to 2005 were evaluated. Biopsy specimens were uniformly studied by light microscopy and IF early post-transplant. A comprehensive vascular score (V1: no AMR, to V5: severe AMR) was prospectively assigned to each EMB, based on severity of both histologic and IF findings. Univariate Cox proportional hazards regressions were performed using indicators of vascular scores alone, combined, and cumulatively. Nine hundred six patients were transplanted and included in the study. Mean age was 46.6 +/- 15.5 years and 82% were male. A total of 26,236 EMBs comprised the study data. As expected, histologic and immunopathologic findings of AMR varied in severity. An incremental risk of cardiovascular mortality was found with more severe AMR whether vascular scores were analyzed individually (p = 0.001), in combination (p = 0.01) or cumulatively (p = 0.006).

Thirty-six HTx donors were marginal, requiring sustained high doses of inotropes (n = 26), low left ventricular ejection fraction (n = 5), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (n = 15), and age older than 55 years (n = 6). Twenty LTx donors had infected sputa or showed pneumonia using chest X-ray. None of 49 HTx recipients died of primary graft failure (PGF). Patient survival at 3 years after HTx was 98.0%. Although 5/39 LTx died early, including 2 of PGF, patient survival rate at 3 years was 66.9%. Although the number of cases was still small, the availability of hearts and lungs has been high and the transplantation outcomes were acceptable. These strategies may be useful to maximize HTx/LTx opportunities.

Since then, Shariati Hospital, affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences, has been representing the most active center of cardiac transplantation in Iran and one of the major sites in the Middle East. This is a comprehensive review of our 15-year practice registry to make a scheme of our record and achievements. Clinical data on all consecutive transplanted patients from the Department of Cardiac Surgery, Shariati Hospital, Tehran, Iran over the last 15 years were reviewed. Descriptive and analytical statistics were extracted in regard to recipients, donors, surgical characteristics, and current status of the patients on follow-up. Totally, 90 patients were transplanted since 1993; 11, 32, and 47 in three five-year periods, respectively. The mean age of the recipients was 29.30+/-13.17 years. Motor-vehicle accident was the main cause of brain death of donors (48.8%). The most common indication for surgery was idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (75.5%).The mean survival rate has been 6.66+/-0.87 years. One-year and five-year survivals had a rising trend through the five-year periods. Acute allograft rejection and infection were the two major events complicating our transplants.

In this study, we sought to confirm which types of device-related infections impact bridge-to-transplant rates. We also aimed to determine the effect of device-related infections on post-transplant survival and post-transplant infection. We retrospectively reviewed paper and electronic medical records for 149 patients undergoing left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation as a bridge to transplantation at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center between 2000 and 2006. The primary outcome measures were survival to transplantation, post-transplant infection and post-transplant survival. Patients with sepsis were less likely to be successfully bridged to cardiac transplantation (7 of 22 vs 103 of 127, 31.8% vs 81.1%, p = 0.01). However, if transplanted, their survival rates at 1 year were not decreased (6 of 7 vs 85 of 103, 85.7% vs 82.5%, p = 1.00). No other pre-transplant device-related infection affected post-transplant survival at 1 year (22 of 27 vs 69 of 83, 81.5% vs 83.1%, p = 1.00). Pre-transplant drive-line infections predicted post-transplant infection in former drive-line or pocket sites (11 of 16 vs 14 of 94, 68.8% vs 14.9%, p = 0.01) and increased overall post-transplant hospital length of stay (16 vs 19 days, p = 0.04). They did not, however, affect post-transplant survival at 1 year (22 of 25 vs 69 of 85, 88% vs 81.2%, p = 0.56). Although survival to transplantation was diminished in LVAD patients with sepsis, if successfully transplanted, post-transplant survival was unaffected. Patients with local device infections and signs of early sepsis may warrant evaluation for urgent transplantation. A pre-transplant drive-line infection was associated with post-transplant infection in either the former pocket or drive-line site, and increased overall length of stay, but it did not decrease post-transplant survival.

Pediatric lung transplantation (LTx) remains a challenge for a highly selected group of patients. The requirements for immunosuppressive therapy and the associated risks must be weighed against the long-term prognosis of this operation. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed our experience after 53 lung and heart-lung transplantations (HLTx) in children. All pediatric patients <18 years of age who underwent LTx (n = 37) and HLTx (n = 16) at our institution were included in this study. We analyzed indications for transplantation, survival rates and causes of death. Herein we assess pediatric-specific challenges in comparison to adults. Thirty-day mortality was 13.2%. Kaplan-Meier survival rates at 1, 3, 5 and 10 years were 69%, 64%, 44% and 39%, respectively. Main indications for transplantation were cystic fibrosis and congenital heart disease with Eisenmenger syndrome. Other diagnoses were retransplantation, primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis. The main causes of death were infection and chronic graft failure. Reduced-size transplantation was performed in 42% of double-lung transplantation (DLTx) patients without negatively impacting survival. Six patients received pulmonary retransplantation, 1 of whom died early. Pediatric transplantation is a feasible therapeutic option when undertaken by an experienced team. It should be offered to the small patient population suffering from end-stage pulmonary disease. The limited number of pediatric donor organs can be overcome by using reduced-size organs. However, the management of pediatric-specific complications and therapeutic requirements is essential for positive long-term results after LTx in these patients.

Pretransplantation patient characteristics determine survival following combined heart and kidney transplantation (HKT). Time-to-event analysis. Academic research. The United Network for Organ Sharing provided deidentified patient-level data. Analysis included 19,373 heart transplant recipients from January 1, 1995, to December 31, 2005. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to identify pretransplantation recipient characteristics associated with improved long-term survival following HKT. Kaplan-Meier survival functions and Cox proportional hazards regression were used for time-to-event analysis. Using the relative risks calculated in regression analysis, weights were assigned for each risk factor, allowing for the construction of a risk score. Among heart transplant recipients, 264 (1.4%) underwent HKT. Factors associated with diminished survival included peripheral vascular disease, recipient age older than 65 years, nonischemic etiology of heart failure, dialysis dependence at the time of transplantation, and bridge to transplantation using a ventricular assist device. After stratification by risk score, 1-year survival was 93.2% and 61.9% in the lowest- and highest-risk HKT groups, respectively. Further stratification by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was performed based on a previous study showing decreased survival of patients undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation with a preoperative eGFR of less than 33 mL/min. Low-risk patients with an eGFR of less than 33 mL/min undergoing HKT constituted the only group that had significantly better survival compared with isolated patients undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation with eGFRs and risk scores in the same range (P = .006). When patients were stratified by risk score and by diminished eGFR (<33 mL/min), low-risk HKT recipients with a diminished eGFR had improved survival following HKT over isolated heart transplant recipients. Only low-risk patients with combined kidney failure (eGFR, <33 mL/min) and heart failure seem to gain a survival benefit from HKT.

Analysis focused on patients undergoing heart transplantation between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2005 (n = 13,024).

However, previous reports have indicated that use of donors with minor ABO mismatches may adversely influence late outcomes, although more recent studies do not confirm this suggestion. Our purpose was to analyze this practice in our center. We analyzed 121 patients who underwent heart transplantation between November 2003 and May 2008. One hundred nine patients (90.0%) received ABO-matched grafts (population 1 [P1]) and 12 (9.9%) received ABO-compatible grafts (population 2 [P2]). P1 included 60 group A, 44 group 0, and 5 group B patients; P2 included 5 group A, 5 group B, and 2 group AB patients. The populations did not differ statistically in age, gender, urgency status, surgical technique, ischemic time, donor features, or immunosuppression. They were assessed for left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), rejection, and mortality. There were no significant differences in total mortality (P1, 13.7%; P2, 8.3%), rejection grade > or =2R (P1, 21.1%; P2, 33.3%), or LVEF (6 months: P1, 65%; P2, 71%; 1 year: P1, 68%; P2, 69%). Minor ABO mismatches did not adversely affect 1-year outcomes of heart transplantation. This practice may facilitate organ allocation for end-stage heart failure patients, thereby reducing waiting time for heart transplantation.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) is a myocardial disease of familiar, origin where the myocardium is replaced by fibrofatty tissue predominantly in the right ventricle. Herein we have presented the clinical courses of 4 patients with ARVD who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation. Among 358 adult patients undergoing heart transplantation, 4 (1.1%) displayed ARVD. The main indication for transplantation was the progression to heart failure associated with arrhythmias. All 4 patients displayed rapid, severe courses leading to heart failure with left ventricular involvement and uncontrolled arrhythmias. In all cases the transplantation was performed using a bicaval technique with prophylactic tricuspid valve annuloplasty. One patient developed hyperacute rejection and infection, leading to death on the 7th day after surgery. The other 3 cases showed a good evolution with clinical remission of the symptoms. Pathological study of the explanted hearts confirmed the presence of the disease. ARVD is a serious cardiomyopathy that can develop malignant arrhythmias, severe ventricular dysfunction with right ventricular predominance, and sudden cardiac death. Orthotopic heart transplantation must always be considered in advanced cases of ARVD with malignant arrhythmias or refractory congestive heart failure with or without uncontrolled arrhythmias, because it is the only way to remit the symptoms and the disease.

The transplant center regulations recently published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) mandate that observed program-specific survival outcomes to fall within expected risk-adjusted outcomes. Meeting these outcomes is essential to continued participation in the Medicare program. Both donor and recipient variables not considered in current risk adjustment models can result in inferior outcomes and therefore may cause an overestimation of transplant center expected performance, precluding participation in the federally funded Medicare program. We reviewed the most recent four reporting periods published by the Scientific Registry for Transplant Recipients on their public website. We identified kidney, liver and heart transplant programs that were flagged for having outcomes statistically lower than expected as well as those that failed to meet CMS criteria. We also analyzed whether center volumes correlated with outcomes in these centers. We highlight the need for mitigating factors that could justify inferior outcomes under specific circumstances. Failure to reach consensus on such a mechanism for appeal may result in risk-averse behavior by transplant centers with respect to innovation and therefore hamper the ability to advance the field of transplantation. We propose a methodology that may address this emerging dilemma.

Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the leading cause of death after the first year following heart transplantation. We compared restenosis rates, mortality, and other major adverse cardiac events (MACE) between transplant recipients treated with DES and BMS for CAV. All patients from our heart transplant registry undergoing PCI with stenting for CAV were identified. Procedural data, baseline clinical characteristics, yearly coronary angiography, cardiac events and death were prospectively collected. Primary outcome was in-stent restenosis (ISR). Secondary outcomes were in-segment restenosis, target vessel revascularization (TVR), all-cause mortality and combined MACE. 36 lesions in 25 patients treated with DES were compared with 31 BMS-treated lesions in 19 patients. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics. 12-month incidence of ISR was 0% with DES vs. 12.9% with BMS, P = 0.03. Over mean (+/-standard error) follow-up of 51.1 +/- 7.5 months this difference was significant for vessels < or =3 mm in diameter, hazard ratio (HR) DES vs. BMS 0.37 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.95) P = 0.037; but not for vessels >3 mm P = 0.45. However, there was no difference in overall longterm patency because of similar rates of in-segment restenosis between DES and BMS, HR 1.13 (95% CI 0.43 to 2.97) P = 0.81. Also, the rates of TVR, death from any cause and combined MACE were similar; log rank P 0.88, 0.67, and 0.85, respectively.

It was unclear whether increased heart rate (HR) increased long-term mortality after heart transplantation (HT). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether HR predicted survival after HT. A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent HT at our institution was performed. Ethnicity, gender, date of birth, age at transplantation, length of follow-up after transplantation, cardiac rhythm within 3 months after transplantation, age at death, reason for transplantation, cause of death, and baseline medications after transplantation were recorded. Continuous variables, such as HR, blood pressure, cardiac ejection fraction, presence of allograft vasculopathy, and serum creatinine, were recorded at <3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after HT, then annually to 10 years after HT. Seventy-eight patients with a mean age of 50 +/- 13 years were identified. Mean survival was 8.5 +/- 6.5 years. Of 78 patients, 32 patients had an HR <or=90 beats/min, and 46 patients had an HR >90 beats/min within 3 months after HT. There was a mean decrease in HR of 6 beats/min during 10 years (p <0.03). Multivariate survival analysis showed that HR >90 beats/min was a significant predictor of early mortality (hazard ratio 2.8, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 5.1, p <0.0013). Patients with a net increase in HR during 10 years had an increased risk of death compared with patients with no change or a net decrease in HR (hazard ratio 4.7, 95% confidence interval 1.9 to 12.0, p <0.002). No significant differences in cause of death between patients with an HR <or=90 or >90 beats/min existed. In conclusion, HT patients with an HR >90 beats/min within the first 3 months after HT were 2.8 times more likely to die than patients with an HR <or=90 beats/min. Patients with a net increase in HR were 4.7 times more likely to die than those whose HR did not change or decreased over time.

Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) has been associated with poor outcome after heart transplantation. The diagnosis of AMR usually includes endomyocardial biopsy findings of endothelial cell swelling, intravascular macrophages, C4d+ staining, and associated left ventricular dysfunction. The significance of AMR findings in biopsy specimens of asymptomatic heart transplant patients (normal cardiac function and no symptoms of heart failure) is unclear. Between July 1997 and September 2001, AMR was found in the biopsy specimens of 43 patients. Patients were divided into 2 groups: asymptomatic AMR (AsAMR, n = 21) and treated AMR (TxAMR with associated left ventricular dysfunction, n = 22). For comparison, a control group of 86 contemporaneous patients, without AMR, was matched for age, gender, and time from transplant. Outcomes included 5-year actuarial survival and development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). Patients were considered to have AMR if they had > or = 1 endomyocardial biopsy specimen positive for AMR. The 5-year actuarial survival for the AsAMR (86%), TxAMR (68%), and control groups (79%) was not significantly different (p = 0.41).

Immunosuppressed baboons underwent miniswine or hDAF pig kidney (n = 6) or heart (n = 7), or Gal-transferase gene-knockout (GalT-KO) (thymo)kidney transplantation (n = 14). Porcine cDNA miniarrays determined donor proinflammatory, apoptosis-related and vascular coagulant/fibrinolytic gene expression at defined time points; validated by mRNA, protein levels and immunopathology. hDAF-transgenic and GalT-KO xenografts, (particularly thymokidneys) exhibited prolonged survival. CC was seen with Gal-expressing porcine kidneys (3 of 6), only 1 of 7 baboons postcardiac xenotransplantation and was infrequent following GalT-KO grafts (1 of 14). Protective-type genes (heme oxygenase-I, superoxide dismutases and CD39) together with von Willebrand factor and P-selectin were upregulated in all renal grafts. Transcriptional responses in Gal-expressing xenografts were comparable to those seen in the infrequent GalT-KO rejection. In cardiac xenografts, fibrin deposition was associated with increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression establishing that gene expression profiles in renal and cardiac xenografts differ in a quantitative manner.

The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. We conclude that many papers have documented the superiority of the bicaval technique over the biatrial technique for short-term outcomes. A meta-analysis of 41 papers on this topic found significant benefits for early atrial pressure, tricuspid valve regurgitation, return to sinus rhythm and even perioperative mortality. But for longer-term outcome, the largest series of 11,931 patients found no difference in survival between the two groups and the meta-analysis found no mortality differences at 1 or 3 years.

Ages ranged from 14 to 64 years. Ischaemic cardiomyopathy (52.5%) and dilated cardiomyopathy (42.5%) were the major indications. From 1990 to 1999, 50% of the donors sustained brain death from road traffic accident, 25% from cerebrovascular accident and 25% from falling from height, whereas the cause of brain death in the donors from 2000 to 2007 was 33%, 47% and 9.5%, respectively. The average donor age increased from 28.3 to 38.1 years. The significant morbidities in the recipients were hypertension, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy and renal dysfunction. Thirtytwo required treatment for hypertension. 67.5% developed CMV disease requiring treatment. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy was diagnosed in 10. Rising creatinine levels reaching over 2.5 mg/dL was seen in 7. Three required renal dialysis. Epstein-Barr virus related lympho proliferative disorder occurred in 2 patients. One patient developed adenocarcinoma of stomach. The 30-day mortality was 10% and half life was 10 years. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy and sepsis caused 41.7% of mortality each. 11.7% of the mortality was due to cerebrovascular accident. The status of heart transplantation in Singapore is comparable to the ISHLT registry data. Transplant provides excellent early survival of 80%; however, the expected half life is around 10 years after cardiac transplantation. The late mortality is mainly caused by cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) and renal failure. More effort and research needs to be directed towards these issues to improve the long-term results.

To determine if left ventricular (LV) morphology is associated with outcome after stage I Norwood palliation for HLHS. Echocardiograms were reviewed from 108 patients who had undergone Norwood palliation at our institution over the past 11 years. Total cardiac diameter, thickness of the interventricular septum (IVS), LV area and LV myocardial area were calculated. Competing risk analysis was performed for survival to a stage II operation and to determine potential predictors. From the Norwood operation up to stage II operation, mortality was predicted by IVS thickness, while the absence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction was predictive of survival to stage II operation. For the complete pathway, from Norwood to the Fontan operation, mortality was predicted by IVS, a lower RV fractional area change and the presence of significant tricuspid regurgitation. Cardiac transplantation during this period was predicted by a lower RV fractional area change (p = 0.02) and a larger LV area in diastole. These results indicate that LV hypertrophy and decreased RV function adversely effect survival after the Norwood operation. They suggest that LV morphology, especially septal hypertrophy, can influence outcomes in HLHS and should be considered when evaluating treatment options.

Secondary mitral insufficiency (SMI) is an indicator of a poor prognosis in patients with ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathies. Numerous studies corroborated that mitral valve (MV) surgery improves survival and may be an alternative to heart transplantation in this group of patients.The aim of the study was to retrospectively analyze the early and mid-term clinical results after MV repair resp. replacement in patients with moderate-severe to severe SMI and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below 35%. We investigated 40 patients with poor LVEF (mean, 28 +/- 5%) and SMI who underwent MV repair (n = 26) resp. replacement (n = 14) at the University Hospital Muenster from January 1994 to December 2005. All patients were on maximized heart failure medication. 6 pts. had prior coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG). Twenty-seven patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III and 13 were in class IV. Eight patients were initially considered for transplantation. During the operation, 14 pts had CABG for incidental disease and 8 had tricuspid valve repair. Follow-up included echocardiography, ECG, and physician's examination and was completed in 90% among survivors. Additionally, the late results were compared with the survival after orthotope heart transplantation (oHTX) in adults with ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathies matched to the same age and time period (148 patients). Three operative deaths (7.5%) occurred as a result of left ventricular failure in one and multiorgan failure in two patients. There were 14 late deaths, 2 to 67 months after MV procedure. Progress of heart failure was the main cause of death. 18 patients who were still alive took part on the follow-up examination. At a mean follow-up of 50 +/- 34 (2-112) months the NYHA class improved significantly from 3.2 +/- 0.5 to 2.2 +/- 0.4 (p < 0.001). The LVEF improved significantly from 29 +/- 5% to 39 +/- 16 (p < 0.05). There were no differences in survival after MV repair or replacement. The 1-, 3-, 5-year survival rates in the study group were 80%, 58% and 55% respectively. In the group of patients after oHTX the survival was accordingly 72%, 68%, 66% (p > 0.05).

We sought to analyze the indications and outcome of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for early primary graft failure and determine its impact on long-term graft function and rejection risk. Early post-operative graft failure requiring ECMO can complicate heart transplantation. A retrospective review of all children requiring ECMO in the early period after transplantation from 1990 to 2007 was undertaken. Twenty-eight (9%) of 310 children who underwent transplantation for cardiomyopathy (n = 5) or congenital heart disease (n = 23) required ECMO support. The total ischemic time was significantly longer for ECMO-rescued recipients compared with our overall transplantation population (276 +/- 86 min vs. 242 +/- 70 min, p < 0.01). The indication for transplantation, for ECMO support, and the timing of cannulation had no impact on survival. Hyperacute rejection was uncommon. Fifteen children were successfully weaned off ECMO and discharged alive (54%). Mean duration of ECMO was 2.8 days for survivors (median 3 days) compared with 4.8 days for nonsurvivors (median 5 days). There was 100% 3-year survival in the ECMO survivor group, with 13 patients (46%) currently alive at a mean follow-up of 8.1 +/- 3.8 years.

In 30 patients (35%) corticosteroids were reinitiated, in 15 cases because of acute rejection (7%), 5 (6%) because of worsening renal function, 5 (6%) because of malignancy, 3 (4%) because of adverse effects of immunosuppressive drugs, and 2 because of severe allograft coronary artery disease. Four patients (5%) died after drug discontinuation. There was a significant decrease in total cholesterol (198 +/- 35 to 181 +/- 38 mg/dL; P < .001) and low-density lipoprotain (LDL) cholesterol levels (113 +/- 30 to 105 +/- 30 mg/dL; P < .001). There were no differences in mortality between patients with and without corticosteroids. Steroid withdrawal is feasible and safe in HTx patients. In our study, it was successfully maintained in 63% of the patients. EMB is helpful to identify patients with acute rejection at 1 and 3 months after withdrawal. Short- to mid-term metabolic benefits are significant reductions in serum total and LDL cholesterol.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is a serious opportunistic infection in solid organ transplant recipients. The TB incidence is 20 to 74 times greater than that among the general population. Our aim was to determine the incidence as well as the clinical, radiological, and microbiological features and outcomes of TB in these patients. We reviewed the clinical records of subjects with posttransplant TB from January 1988 to December 2007. A definite TB case was defined by a positive culture; probable TB by a positive smear or histological finding; and disseminated TB when 2 organs were involved. We noted an early diagnosis as ones in the first year posttransplantation. Outcomes were classified following the WHO recommendation and mortality related defined by death during treatment. Among 4634 recipients (2757 kidney, 1334 liver, 361 double kidney-pancreas, and 182 heart), 21 (0.45%) developed posttransplant TB: namely, 0.47%, 0.22%, 1.1%, and 0.54%, respectively. In 2 cases M. tuberculosis did not grow upon culture; the diagnosis was established by positive acid-fast bacilli on a sputum smear or by histological findings on biopsy. The mean posttransplantation time to TB diagnosis was 21 months (48% early TB). Two patients had a previous history of TB. Fever was the most common symptom (71%). Pulmonary tuberculosis represented 47.6% of cases; extrapulmonary, 28.6%; and disseminated, 23.8%. Among the cases of pulmonary TB, 60% had unilateral infiltrates and 10% cavitations on X ray. Eighteen patients completed treatment. Five patients displayed adverse events, 3 of which were liver toxicity. Four patients died, with 3 deaths related to TB. The incidence of TB in this cohort was higher than that among the general population (450 cases/100,000 recipients). TB was associated with adverse effects of treatment and significant mortality.

Heart transplantation is the criterion standard for treating end-stage heart failure. Male sex of both the donor organ and the recipient is advantageous for survival, possibly owing to hemodynamic or immunologic reasons. The effect of sex mismatch on long-term survival in male heart transplant recipients is less known. In this prospective single-center study, we reviewed follow-up data for 57 sex-mismatched and 179 sex-matched men who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation between 1990 and 2002. Median survival was significantly shorter in the sex-mismatched group (8.1 vs 12.9 years; P < .04). Subgroup analysis revealed that this was even more pronounced in male heart recipients with coronary artery disease (2.4 vs 12.9 years; P < .001). Female donor organs were significantly smaller (left ventricular end-diastolic diameter 49 vs 51 mm; P < .05), and recipients more often experienced clinically relevant episodes of cellular rejection during the first 3 months posttransplantation (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade 3, 5.6% vs 3.1%; P < .001). Global left ventricular function, and immunosuppressive and inflammatory parameters did not differ. In male orthotopic heart transplant recipients, sex mismatch is associated with adverse outcome owing to increased number and severity of episodes of graft rejection.

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is superior to azathioprine (AZA) in preventing allograft rejections episodes (ARE) early after heart transplantation (HTx). However, long-term efficacy and adverse events are barely known. We evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety, comparing patient outcomes with either MMF or AZA as components of maintenance immunosuppression regimens. We evaluated all patients who underwent HTx between January 1994 and May 2003 and received the same induction immunosuppression followed by treatment with cyclosporine (CsA), prednisolone, and with either MMF or AZA. We analyzed the survival, number, and severity of ARE, development of coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV), and main adverse effects (infections, tumors). Patients receiving MMF (n = 137) showed a lower mortality rate than those treated with AZA (n = 121). There were significant differences between the groups for all parameters evaluated (P < .01). The prevalence of deaths was 18.3% in the MMF group and 47.9% in the AZA group. Biopsy-proven ARE greater than grade 1A and antirejection therapies per patient were lower among the MMF than the AZA group (0.20 vs 0.31 and 0.96 vs 1.24, respectively). Prevalence of coronary stenoses was 11.7% in the MMF group and 24.8% in the AZA group. Rate of extracutaneous and cutaneous malignancies was lower in the MMF than the AZA group (7.3% and 5.8% vs 18.2% and 9.1%, respectively). The prevalence of infections was higher in the MMF group. Patients who were switched during the first post-HTx year from AZA to MMF (n = 97) and thereafter received CsA plus MMF for >1 year also showed significantly better survival than those who remained on AZA treatment. Among a cohort of patients being followed long term, MMF appeared to be highly efficient to prevent both ARE and the development of coronary artery stenoses. The use of MMF also significantly improved the survival of heart transplant recipients compared with AZA, despite a greater incidence of infections linked to MMF therapy.

We prospectively evaluated the prognostic relationship of HDL levels in severe HF by examining 132 consecutive patients listed for heart transplantation (52 +/- 11 years of age, 80% men, 79% white, mean follow-up 18 months). Using population mean HDL levels (HDL <33 mg/dl [n = 47] vs > or =33 mg/dl [n = 85]), patients were grouped and followed for the primary composite end-points of HF hospitalizations or death, stratified by underlying etiology (non-ischemic, n = 52; ischemic, n = 80). Patients with HDL <33 mg/dl had lower serum sodium (135 vs 137 mEq/liter, p = 0.008), higher total bilirubin (1.3 vs 0.7 mg/dl, p < 0.001) and higher uric acid (7.6 vs 6.7 mg/dl, p = 0.048) levels, but similar serum creatinine compared with the > or =33 mg/dl HDL group. Survival analysis, using a Cox proportional hazards model, revealed reduced HDL (<33 mg/dl) as the most significant independent predictor of HF hospitalizations or death, independent of underlying etiology. Low-cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol alone were not found to be independently predictive of outcome. Lower HDL levels correlate with adverse prognosis independent of etiology and predict clinical worsening or death in advanced HF.

Cyclosporine (CsA) absorption varies early after transplantation and can be accurately assessed by the area under the absorption curve (AUC). The 2-hour post-dose (C2) level of CsA in whole blood is reported to be a useful surrogate marker of CsA AUC in kidney and liver transplant monitoring, but should be further explored in thoracic organ recipients. In a 12-month study we included de novo lung (n = 95) and heart (n = 96) recipients. All participants received cyclosporine (Sandimmun Neoral) monitored by C0 and blood was collected for analysis of C2 retrospectively. Abbreviated AUC (AUC(0-4)) was measured at 7 days and 3 months. Primary outcome was C2 relation to the frequency of acute cellular rejection (ACR) needing treatment and possible decline in measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR). Recipients were divided into lower, middle and upper third C2 groups based on 2-week post-operative values (tertiles T1 to T3). C2 was the most robust substitute for AUC(0-4) in the group of patients studied. For lung, but not heart, recipients there were differences in mean number of ACRs (p = 0.05), incidence of any rejections (p = 0.04), mean number of any rejections (p = 0.001) and time to first rejection (p = 0.03) between T1 and T3.

There were 28 (15%) deaths, patients with SUA > or = 502 micromol/L (upper quartile) at 1 year post-HTx had an increased risk of total mortality (adjusted HR 2.21, P = 0.03) and cardiac mortality (adjusted HR 4.38, P = 0.03). Elevated SUA was a significant risk factor for development of moderate/severe angiographic CAV (adjusted HR 4.79, P = 0.01). A smaller decline in SUA (<97 micromol/L) during the first year post-HTx was also associated with an increased risk of mortality (P = 0.02).

However, the outcomes of heart transplantation for patients with end-stage valvular heart disease are less well reported. This is a substantial group of patients, many of whom have had previous cardiac surgery. They therefore may be considered a subgroup with a poor prognosis. This study reports on the outcomes of heart transplantation for patients with end-stage valvular heart disease. From March 1989 to December 2004, 75 consecutive adult heart transplantations were performed for end-stage valvular heart disease. Clinical characteristics were retrieved from a computerized database. The early mortality risk in heart transplantation for end-stage valvular heart disease was 13%, compared to 8% for other indications (p = 0.12). The main causes of early death were rejection (20%) and right ventricular failure (20%). The total follow-up time was 415 patient-years. During the follow-up, another 23 patients died (55/1000 patient-years of late mortality rate), mostly due to infection (43%) and multiorgan failure (22%). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that increased waiting time to heart transplantation correlated with increased survival (HR = 0.998, p = 0.04).

Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is a life-threatening complication in cardiac transplantation. A sensitive, specific, and easily measurable predictor in donors could facilitate PGD prevention. SMARCAL1 is a matrix-associated regulator of chromatin with helicase and ATPase activities, and its serum concentrations were significantly increased in a targeted protein array in donors whose grafts developed PGD. Therefore, this study analyzed SMARCAL1 serum concentrations by ELISA in 336 heart donors before and after aortic cross-clamping (ACC) and in recipients at 10, 30, and 60 minutes reperfusion. Demographic and hemodynamic parameters of donors and recipients as well as transplant procedure characteristics were documented. PGD (n=68) was defined as ventricular dilation and hypocontractility associated with systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure >20 mm Hg, and decreased mixed venous oxygen saturation necessitating mechanical circulatory support. SMARCAL1 serum protein concentration was significantly increased only before and after ACC in donors (P<0.0001) whose grafts developed PGD compared to those who did not. In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, SMARCAL1 serum concentration at a cut-off level of > or =1.25 ng/mL before ACC in donors predicted PGD (P<0.0001, AUC=0.988, OR=17.050, 95% CI=5.200 to 55.901) with 96% sensitivity and 88% specificity.

Orthotopic transplants were performed after 6 hours of cold static allograft storage. Donor pigs were randomly assigned to pretreatment with (n=7) or without (n=6) HTS (4.5 mL/kg of 7.5% NaCl) administered 1 hour before donor heart arrest. Administration of HTS increased serum sodium level from 138+/-2 mmol/L to 154+/-4 mmol/L, which normalized to 144+/-3 mmol/L 1 hour after infusion. Successful weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass was significantly greater in HTS-treated hearts (6/7 vs 1/6; P=0.029).

Patients requiring right ventricular assist device support or noncardiac procedures were excluded. Preoperative characteristics were similar for patients with and without concurrent cardiac procedures. Overall 30-day mortality was 5.8% for the HMII group and 11.3% for the HMII+CCP group. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that simultaneous patent foramen ovale closure was not associated with an increased 30-day mortality rate, but concurrent valvular procedures increased the risk to 8.5%.

Our novel technique of murine heterotopic cardiac transplantation consists of three critical steps: (i) a novel procedure for graft harvest; (ii) a modified method for recipient vessel preparation; and (iii) a novel suturing procedure for graft implantation.

Data were retrieved of patients who underwent a combined heart-lung transplantation in the UMCG between December 1996 and December 2007. Demographic, clinical and other relevant characteristics were recorded, as well as post-transplantation morbidity and mortality. The study group consisted of 14 patients (3 men and 11 women) with a mean age of 41 years. Indications for heart-lung transplantation were: congenital heart disease complicated by pulmonary hypertension (6 patients), idiopathic pulmonary hypertension with severe right ventricle failure (4 patients), lung fibrosis with severe right ventricle failure (1 patient), cystic fibrosis with systolic left ventricle failure (1 patient), pulmonary hypertension after thoracic radiation and chemotherapy (1 patient) and re-transplantation after lung-transplant failure (1 patient). The mean waiting time prior to operation was approximately 1.5 years. 9 of the 14 patients (64%) underwent such a marked clinical deterioration during the waiting period that they were given a 'very high urgency status' for transplantation. Almost half of patients became dependent on supplementary intravenous inotropics during the waiting period. At the end of the study 6 of the 14 patients (43%) were alive, with a mean survival period of 58 months (range: 6-132). Infection was the cause of death in 4 of the 8 patients. Of the 8 deceased patients, 4 were underweight preoperatively (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2) and were cachectic. This was the case in only 1 of the 6 surviving patients. A combined heart-lung transplantation is a rare operation in the Netherlands. The waiting time in this study was long and the post-transplantation mortality was high. Underweight (cachexia), a sign of a poor clinical condition, appears to be associated with mortality.

Identification of modifiable psychosocial characteristics related to survival of heart transplant (HTx) candidates is needed to prevent clinical deterioration and improve prognosis. A multi-site, prospective study was conducted with 318 HTx candidates (18% female, 82% male; 53 +/- 11 years of age) newly listed at 17 hospitals in Germany and Austria. Baseline demographic and psychosocial characteristics were assessed by questionnaires. Indicators of disease severity (Heart Failure Survival Score, creatinine, cardiac index) and 12-month outcomes (death, high-urgency HTx, elective HTx, de-listing due to deterioration or improvement) were provided by Eurotransplant. By 12 months, 33 patients died, 83 received an urgent HTx, 30 underwent an elective HTx, and 9 were de-listed due to clinical deterioration and 17 due to improvement. All measures of disease severity predicted outcomes. Controlling for disease severity, the number of social contacts contributed significantly to outcomes, favoring those who improved. Comparing socially isolated patients (<4 social contacts/month) who also had depression scores in the clinical range (high psychosocial risk group; n = 37) to those with >10 social contacts/month without depression (low psychosocial risk group; n = 47) revealed significant differences in the distribution of outcome frequencies (chi-square = 11.2, df = 4, p < 0.04). The high psychosocial risk group was more likely to have died/deteriorated and less likely to have improved than the low psychosocial risk group. Regardless of disease severity, socially isolated HTx candidates who are also depressed may be at increased risk for clinical deterioration and mortality, indicating a need for psychosocial intervention.

We conducted a retrospective, single-center cohort study of patients with MRT-associated cardiovascular disease who underwent OHT between January 1987 and September 2008. Nine patients (3 men), aged 46 +/- 11 years at the time of their OHT, were identified. Time from MRT to OHT was 26 +/- 11 years. Lymphoma was the indication for MRT in all patients. Five patients had non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, 2 had ischemic cardiomyopathy and 2 had constrictive pericarditis. Three patients expired in the peri-operative period, whereas another patient died 3 years post-transplant from lung carcinoma. Two additional patients developed a secondary malignancy post-transplant. Five patients are still alive at a mean follow-up of 10 +/- 8 years. Early survival rate is poor in patients who undergo OHT for MRT-associated end-stage cardiovascular disease. In addition, long-term follow-up shows an elevated incidence of malignancies.

Quantification of donor-associated risk in a specific heart transplant recipient is often difficult. Our aim was to identify donor characteristics that affect survival in the contemporary era. Between 1990 and 2006, 7,322 patients from 32 centers in the Cardiac Transplant Research Database underwent heart transplantation. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify donor-associated risk predictors and important interactions between these donor characteristics. Recipient survival was examined using parametric regression analysis in the hazard function domain. Donor characteristics associated with post-transplant death included donor age, donor requirement for vasoactive therapy, positive donor cytomegalovirus serology, longer graft ischemic time, and lower donor body weight. Several interactions between individual donor characteristics affected survival. In male donors, history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus were risk factors for death (p = 0.006, p = 0.04, respectively), but not in female donors (p = 0.5, p = 0.8, respectively). There was a significant interaction between donor age and recipient-donor weight difference. If the donor was of younger age, increasing recipient-donor weight difference did not result in increased death. With increasing donor age, weight difference did result in compromised survival (p < 0.0003). Donor and recipient gender further modified the degree of risk: risk was higher in female donors and when recipients were male (p < 0.0003). This multi-institutional analysis identified important interactions between donor characteristics that affect post-transplant survival that explain some of the discrepancies in the results of previous studies.

We assessed whether patient SE position, determined for the block group of patient residence (average population 1000, smallest census unit with SE data), is associated with graft failure in pediatric heart transplant recipients. We used the US Census 2000 database to derive a composite SE score for the block group of residence for all patients who underwent their first heart transplant at Children's Hospital Boston between 1991 and 2005 (n=135). Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the risk of graft failure (death or retransplant) in the lowest tertile SE group (low SE group) compared with the remaining 2 of 3 patients (controls). The 2 groups were similar with respect to age, gender, diagnosis, and year of transplant. White race was less frequent in low SE group (64% versus 90%, P=0.001). Graft failure occurred in 46 transplant recipients (40 deaths, 6 retransplant). Low SE group (hazard ratio 2.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.3) and nonwhite race (hazard ratio 2.7, 95% CI 1.4 to 5.2) were both associated with higher risk of graft failure. In a multivariable model controlling for diagnosis and pretransplant support, race, and low SE position (hazard ratio 2.0, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.7, P=0.04) remained associated with graft failure.

We used data from the multi-institutional prospectively collected United Network for Organ Sharing open transplantation cohort to review 18 240 adult patients who received orthotopic heart transplantation from 1999 to 2007. Four donor recipient strata were identified (male donor/male recipient, N=10 750; female donor/female recipient, N=2201; male donor/female recipient, N=2121; and female donor/male recipient, N=3168). The primary end point of all cause posttransplant mortality was compared among groups using a Cox proportional hazard regression model with additional propensity adjustment. Female recipients, irrespective of donor sex, had 3.6% lower overall survival at 5 years posttransplant (P=0.003). Men who received organs from male donors had the highest cumulative survival at 5 years (74.5%). Men receiving female hearts had a 15% increase in the risk of adjusted cumulative mortality (hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.30; P=0.02). No significant increase in the relative hazard for death occurred for women receiving opposite sex donor organs (1.24; 0.92 to 1.35; P=0.31).

We investigated diastolic mechanical dyssynchrony and its relation to clinical status in pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We calculated a diastolic and systolic dyssynchrony index (standard deviation of time to peak tissue early diastolic/systolic velocity in 12 left ventricular segments) in 33 children with DCM and 46 control subjects. A threshold to diagnose diastolic dyssynchrony was determined, and cardiac function and clinical outcomes were compared between DCM patients with and without diastolic dyssynchrony. Left ventricular wall motion was more synchronized in diastole than in systole. The diastolic dyssynchrony index was significantly higher in children with DCM than in control subjects (28.1+/-18.1 versus 9.1+/-3.8 ms, P<0.0001). A 17-ms threshold indicated the presence of diastolic dyssynchrony. Patients who died or underwent transplantation had greater diastolic dyssynchrony (diastolic dyssynchrony index 37.9+/-20.5 versus 22.1+/-13.8 ms, P=0.01), and the rate of transplant-free survival appeared to be worse for DCM patients with diastolic dyssynchrony than for patients with synchronous DCM (hazard ratio 2.98, P=0.11; hazard ratio adjusted for disease duration 2.95, P=0.17).

A similar interaction was identified between age and LV end-systolic dimension z score (P=0.04). Neither LV function nor mass was associated with death, overall, or in subgroups. The severity of LV dilation at listing for heart transplant is associated with outcome in infants and young children with dilated cardiomyopathy, whereas the severity of LV systolic dysfunction is not.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of donor hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) status on outcomes of lung and heart-lung transplant recipients. Using United Network for Organ Sharing/Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data, we compared outcomes of 13,233 recipients of HBcAb negative organs with 333 recipients of HBcAb positive donor organs. We found that the unadjusted 1-year survival of recipients of HBcAb positive donor was worse, but there was no difference in survival after adjusting for baseline donor and recipient differences. On multivariate analysis, recipient and donor age, procedure type, era of transplant, baseline medical condition, diagnosis, and donor hepatitis C antibody status impacted 1- and 5-year survival. However, donor HBcAb status did not impact 1- or 5-year survival posttransplant.

The United Network for Organ Sharing provided de-identified patient-level data. The study population included 10,668 orthotopic heart transplant recipients aged 18 years old or older and undergoing transplantation between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2006. Follow-up data were provided through August 3, 2008, with a mean follow-up time of 3.17 +/- 2.15 years (range, 0-8.11 years). The primary outcome was actuarial posttransplant graft survival. Other outcomes of interest included infection, stroke, and dialysis during the transplant hospitalization; primary graft failure at 30 days; transplant hospitalization length of stay; and long-term complications including diabetes mellitus, transplant coronary artery disease, and chronic dialysis. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression (backward, P < .15) was used to determine the relationship between groups and overall graft survival, and multivariable logistic regression analysis (backward, P < .15) was used to determine the relationship between groups and secondary outcome measures. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, when compared with the nonbridged group, risk-adjusted greater than 90-day graft survival was diminished among the EXTRA group (hazard ratio = 3.54, 2.28-5.51, P < .001), but not the INTRA group (1.04, 0.719-1.51, P = .834) or the PARA group (1.06, 0.642-1.76, P = .809). There were no significant differences in risk-adjusted graft survival across the 4 groups during the 90-days to 1-year or 1- to 5-year intervals.

A significant progress in the treatment of heart failure occurred during the last 20 years. These advances were associated with the introduction and subsequent widespread use of angiotensin- -converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers, but also with progress in device therapy and cardiac surgery. Overall, prognosis in patients with severe heart failure is similar to outcomes reported in multicenter randomized clinical trials, such as CONSENSUS, CIBIS II, MERIT-HF, and COPERNICUS. In 2003-2007, a registry of patients with severe heart failure was established in Poland (POLKARD-HF) that included all patients initially considered candidates for heart transplantation (HTX). Mean duration of follow-up was 601 days (range 1-1462 days). One-year mortality (defined as death or super-urgent HTX) was 20% and differed from data presented by Stewart (2001). In addition, patient survival in the POLKARD-HF registry depending on the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class changed significantly in comparison to outcomes reported in the late 1980s. However, one-year mortality among NYHA class IV patients is still high and exceeds 50%. As reported in the POLKARD-HF registry, one- -year risk of death among patient who underwent elective HTX was about 20%, and 3-year risk was about 22%, significantly different from the risk of death among medically treated patients with heart failure. These results are similar to other European data and warrant reconsideration of appropriatness of HTX in elective patients (UNOS 2 status). Undoubtedly, NYHA class IV patients are candidates for HTX and should remain under specialist care in cardiac transplantation centers, and HTX should be performed in this group when indications for this procedure become urgent (UNOS 1 and 1a status). A specialized system of care for patients with severe heart failure should be created in Poland, particularly for patients referred for HTX.

In multivariate analysis, recipients receiving a donor heart with serum sodium level lower than 130 mmol/l or higher than 170 mmol/l had a 1.25-fold higher risk for 1-year post-transplant mortality than patients with normal donor sodium ranges (P = 0.007). Other independent risk factors for impaired 1-year survival were recipient age, the indication for transplantation and the urgency status of the recipient.

We prospectively tested the predictive value of a complete set of psychiatric and psychological variables, collected with both self-rating and observer-based instruments at midterm after heart transplantation, on the subsequent 6-year survival status. Ninety-five heart transplanted patients underwent the structured clinical interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-4th Edition and the structured interview for Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research and filled three questionnaires assessing the dimensions of psychological distress, quality of life, and psychological well-being.

When multivariate analyses were performed, high levels of hostility and the presence of diabetes resulted the independent predictors of survival status.

Data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients were used to analyze the relationship between transplant center volume and short-term survival. Center volume designation (very low, low, medium, and high) was assigned on the basis of quartiles with approximately equal numbers of patients per group.

Period analysis, a survival analysis method that uses left truncation and was shown to provide more up-to-date survival estimates than traditional, cohort-based methods in other medical fields, may improve the timeliness of survival monitoring in transplantation. Using United Network for Organ Sharing/Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data, we evaluated, through a series of comparisons, how well most up-to-date 5-year survival estimates potentially derivable by two commonly used cohort-based methods and the period method would have been able to predict the later observed survival of corresponding most recent transplants in the dataset between 1992 to 1994 and 2001 to 2003. In the analysis of overall survival, period analysis provided a best prediction for 93 of the 100 evaluated point estimates, whereas among 350 evaluated point estimates of age-specific survival, period analysis provided a best estimate on 254 occasions (72.6%), compared with 49 (14.0%) and 82 (23.4%) occasions for the cohort-based approaches. Mean average absolute differences between period estimates and the later observed survival were meaningfully lower than those obtained by traditional methods, indicating that period estimates may provide much better survival predictions for recently transplanted grafts and patients than estimates derivable at the same time by traditional survival analysis approaches. The timeliness of survival monitoring can be meaningfully improved by the application of period analysis. The use of period analysis for providing more up-to-date survival estimates in transplantation may be encouraged.

Chronic kidney disease among prior heart transplant recipients is a growing problem that is likely to place an increased demand on a limited supply of kidney allografts. Allocation of the limited resource of kidneys for transplantation requires consideration of the demands of fair distribution and optimizing patient and graft survival. The aim of this study was to compare the kidney transplant outcomes among recipients of kidney after prior heart transplantation (KAH, n=456) with kidney transplantation in other clinical settings. A retrospective cohort study using United Network for Organ Sharing registry data (1995-2008) was performed comparing renal allograft survival among KAH recipients with patients who underwent simultaneous kidney-heart transplant (SKH, n=252), primary kidney transplant alone (KA1, n=112,882), or repeat kidney transplant alone (KA2, n=14,070). The annual number of KAH recipients more than quadrupled during the study period from 24 in 1995 to 99 in 2008. In a multivariable analysis using Cox regression, allograft survival among KAH recipients was not different from SKH (P=0.16, hazards ratio [HR]=0.79, confidence interval [CI]=0.57-1.10), and KA2 (P=0.11, HR=0.86, CI=0.72-1.04), but it was inferior to KA1 (P<0.001, HR=0.66, CI=0.55-0.80). Patient death accounted for 75.2% of KAH kidney loss. Kidney quality as measured by living or deceased donors (P=0.62) and standard criteria or extended criteria (P=0.87) was not associated with survival; however, there was a trend toward improved survival (P=0.08) among recipients of a preemptive transplant. Kidney graft survival among prior heart transplant recipients is inferior to KA1 but similar to other clinical scenarios.

In a retrospective study from 1983 to 2007, 145 (25%) of 585 HTx recipients developed ARF, defined as \u2265 26.4 micromol/L or \u2265 50% increase in serum creatinine from pre-operatively to the seventh day post-HTx and/or the need of early post-operative dialysis. Independent risk factors for ARF were intravenous cyclosporine immediately post-operatively (odds ratio [OR] 2.16, 95% CI 1.34-3.50, p = 0.02), donor age (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00-1.04, p = 0.02), and pre-operative cardiac output (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.12-1.71, p = 0.003).

A major limitation to success in pediatric heart transplantation is donor organ shortage. While the use of allografts from donors larger than the recipient is accepted, the use of undersized donor grafts is generally discouraged. Using the UNOS database, we wanted to evaluate whether using smaller donor hearts affects the short- and long-term survival of pediatric heart transplant patients. A retrospective analysis of data entered into the UNOS database from April 1994 to May 2008 was performed. Pediatric heart transplant recipients (ages 0-18 yr) with DRWR <2.0 were identified and divided into two groups: Low-DRWR (<0.8) and Ideal-DRWR (0.8-2.0). Patients' demographics, pretransplant diagnoses, age at transplantation, severity of pretransplant condition, and rate of complications prior to hospital discharge after transplantation were noted. Fisher's exact, chi-square, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare patients' baseline characteristics. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard regression were used to compare patients' survival and to identify independent risk factors for outcomes. There were 3048 patients (204 with Low- and 2844 with Ideal-DRWR). The Low-ratio group patients were older (8.3 vs. 6.9 yr; p = 0.001), there was a slight male predominance in the Low-DRWR group (p = 0.055). The Low-DRWR group had longer transplant wait time than the Ideal-DRWR group (97 vs. 85 days; p = 0.04). The groups did not differ in race, primary diagnoses, severity of pretransplant condition (medical urgency status, need for ventilation, inotropic support, ECMO, nitric oxide, or dialysis, the PVR for those with bi-ventricular anatomy), or post-transplant complications (length of stay, need for inotropic support, dialysis, and rate of infections). The Low-DRWR patients had less episodes of acute rejection during the first-post-transplant month. Infants with DRWR 0.5-0.59 had lower 30-day survival rate (p = 0.045).

Preoperative pulmonary vascular disease remains an important risk factor for death or right-heart failure in selected children undergoing two-ventricle repair, single-ventricle palliation, or heart transplantation. Preoperative criteria for poor outcome after operation remain unclear. The purpose of this review is to critically assess both the historic and current data and make recommendations where appropriate. An extensive literature search was undertaken in October 2009. Data were analyzed by an expert multidisciplinary team and recommendations were made by consensus. PubMed was searched in October 2009. Data were analyzed and recommendations were made by consensus of a multidisciplinary team. In patients with suspected pulmonary vascular disease anticipating a two-ventricle repair, although preoperative testing via cardiac catheterization with vasodilators is reasonable, the preoperative parameters and the precise values of these parameters that best correlate with early and late outcome remain unclear. Further investigation is warranted in selected populations, such as the growing group of children with congenital heart disease complicated by chronic lung disease of prematurity, and in the developing world where patients may be more likely to present late with advanced pulmonary vascular disease. In patients with a functional single ventricle, there is growing evidence that mean pulmonary artery pressure of >15 mm Hg may be associated with both early and late mortality after the Fontan operation. The relationship of preoperative pulmonary hemodynamics to early and late morbidity remains to be defined. There most likely is a level of preoperative pulmonary vascular disease that puts an individual patient at increased risk for death or severe cyanosis after a bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis. It remains unclear, however, how to best assess this risk preoperatively. The limitations in obtaining an accurate assessment of pulmonary vascular disease in the complex single ventricle are discussed. In children awaiting cardiac transplantation with elevated pulmonary vascular disease of >6 U.m and/or transpulmonary gradient of >15 mm Hg, heart transplantation is deemed feasible in most transplant centers if the administration of inotropes or vasodilators can decrease the pulmonary vascular disease to <6 U.m or transpulmonary gradient to <15 mm Hg. In patients with preoperative pulmonary vascular disease, there may be contributing factors to the pulmonary vascular disease, such as the specifics of the cardiac lesion (atrioventricular valve regurgitation, low cardiac output), parenchymal and/or airway issues, and/or individual genetic predisposition.

A best evidence topic (BET) in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was whether ABO-incompatible (ABO-I) heart transplant recipients have a similar survival rate as an ABO-compatible (ABO-C) transplant in the pediatric population <1 year of age. Altogether more than 112 papers were found using the reported search, of which 10 represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. Generally, ABO-I transplantation has been associated with the neonatal population because of the relative immaturity of the immune system for the first year of life. In the BET the search-term 'pediatric' was used as a method to ensure retrieval all relevant papers. However, the vast majority of the patients reviewed were <1 year of age with specific techniques undertaken to modulate preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative isohemagglutinin titer levels with rejection monitoring. Therefore, the BET conclusions should not be applied to the pediatric group as a broad age classification. Two large series are of particular interest. Patel et al. reviewed all primary heart transplantation recipients < or =1 year of age in the United Network for Organ Sharing/Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (UNOS/OPTN) registry (ABO-I=35 vs. ABO-C=556). There was no difference in 30-day mortality (ABO-I=5.9% vs. ABO-C=8.8%; P=0.55); one-year mortality (ABO-I=16.6% vs. ABO-C=14.7%; P=0.77); graft rejection (ABO-I=1 vs. ABO-C=0); and graft failure (ABO-I=24% vs. ABO-C=24%; P>0.99). Three-year Kaplan-Meier survival was 70% (P=0.85). Propensity score adjusted analysis did not implicate ABO-I as a predictor of mortality [hazard ratio (HR)=3.6, confidence interval (CI): 0.2-49.0; P=0.33]. The ABO-I group demonstrated an increased need for pacemaker (ABO-I=3.1% vs. ABO-C=0.4%; P=0.03) and higher stroke rate (ABO-I=12.9% vs. ABO-C=1.3%; P<0.0001). Dipchand et al. published the results of the Toronto cohort from 1992 to 2006 (ABO-I=16 vs. ABO-C=38). The median age at transplantation (ABO-I=88 days vs. ABO-C=84 days; P=0.82) and the number of neonatal transplant recipients (ABO-I=17% vs. ABO-C=22%; P=0.59) was similar. The freedom from post-transplantation death or retransplantation was equivalent at one year (ABO-I=77% vs. ABO-C=84%) and seven years (ABO-I=74% vs. ABO-C=74%; P=0.87).

In the group that received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 8 patients (73%) were successfully weaned and discharged with excellent functional class. There were no differences in operative mortality, functional class, survival, rejection, and infection rates between the bridged and nonbridged groups. Overall actuarial 1- and 5-year survival rates were 93% and 83%, respectively. All survivors had good functional class.

Orthotopic heart transplantation is the treatment of choice for end-stage heart failure, and calcineurin inhibitor agents allow for better allograft survival. However, pretransplantation low cardiac output status and posttransplantation immunosuppressants contribute toward deterioration of renal function. From 1987 to 2008, 350 patients underwent orthotopic heart transplantation in our hospital. Most of them received anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) as the induction immunosuppressant. The introduction of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) reduced the maintenance level of cyclosporine. The 26 patients who developed end-stage renal disease required dialysis. We reviewed the patient characteristics, including pretransplantation status, immunosuppressant regimens and drug levels, time and type of dialysis, and mortality rate. The mean age of these 26 patients was 53 years. Three patients underwent peritoneal dialysis. The overall 1-year survival rate was 96%, and the 5-year survival rate was 80%. The duration from heart transplantation to chronic dialysis correlated with the presence of a pretransplantation diagnosis of diabetes (P<.05) and an elevated pretransplantation blood creatinine level (P=.01), but there was no significant effect of the initial level of cyclosporine. In addition, the pretransplantation blood creatinine level was also related to the necessity of immediate postoperative hemodialysis (P=.01). There was no significant risk factor in relation to mortality. Regardless of modification of immunosuppressant regimens and initial drug levels, pretransplantation kidney function played an important inverse role in the duration from transplantation to dialysis: the higher the pretransplantation blood creatinine, the shorter the duration. While awaiting a heart transplant, more effort should be spent on protecting renal function to avoid early chronic dialysis.

Heart transplantation in patients with adult congenital heart disease is increasing, yet no large studies have defined how this subgroup differs from other adult recipients. We investigated outcomes and risk factors for mortality and retransplantation among patients with adult congenital heart disease compared with adult recipients. A review was performed of 18- to 45-year-old patients undergoing heart transplantation from 1990-2008 reported to the United Network for Organ Sharing database. Trends were compared between 2 eras: era 1 (1990-1998) and era 2 (1999-2008). Multivariable semiparametric hazard models identified factors associated with time-related death and retransplantation. Of 8496 patients identified, 575 had adult congenital heart disease. The prevalence of heart transplantation among adult recipients decreased by 28% over time (P < .001) and increased among patients with adult congenital heart disease by 41% (P < .001). Induction therapy use was less in patients with adult congenital heart disease (66%) compared with that seen in adult recipients (71%, P = .02). Steroid maintenance was less in patients with adult congenital heart disease (92%) compared with that seen in adult recipients (97%, P < .001). Post-heart transplantation survival among adult recipients improved over time (P = .02) but not among patients with adult congenital heart disease (P = .81). Overall post-heart transplantation mortality (P = .006) and retransplantation (P = .03) were significantly higher for patients with adult congenital heart disease than for adult recipients, mainly because of an early hazard phase. Adult congenital heart disease was a risk factor for both death (P < .001) and retransplantation (P = .04). Any induction therapy and steroid maintenance was associated with improved survival for all recipients (P = .001). Adult congenital heart disease represent an increasing proportion of heart transplant recipients. Compared with adult recipients, patients with adult congenital heart disease experience higher post-heart transplantation mortality and retransplantation.

Although left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are associated with excellent outcomes in patients with end-stage heart failure, there are conflicting reports on posttransplant survival in these patients. Furthermore, prior studies with pulsatile LVADs have shown that transplantation, either early (<6 weeks) or late (>6 months) after LVAD implantation, adversely affected post-cardiac transplant survival. We sought to determine factors related to posttransplant survival in patients supported with continuous-flow LVADs. The HeartMate II LVAD (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, Calif) was implanted in 468 patients as a bridge to transplant at 36 centers in a multicenter trial. Patients who underwent transplantation after support were stratified by demographics: gender, age, etiology, body mass index, duration of device support, and by adverse events during support. The median age was 54 years (range 18-73 years); 43% had ischemic etiology, and 18% were women. Survival was determined at the specific intervals of 30 days and 1 year after transplantation. Of 468 patients, 250 (53%) underwent cardiac transplant after a median duration of LVAD support of 151 days (longest: 3.2 years), 106 (23%) died, 12 (2.6%) recovered ventricular function and the device was removed, and 100 (21%) were still receiving LVAD support. The overall 30-day and 1-year posttransplant survivals were 97% and 87%. There were no significant differences in survival based on demographic factors or LVAD duration of less than 30 days, 30 to 90 days, 90 to 180 days, and more than 180 days. Patients requiring more than 2 units of packed red blood cells in 24 hours during LVAD support had a statistically significant decreased 1-year survival (82% vs 94%) when compared with patients who did not require more than 2 units of packed red blood cells in 24 hours during LVAD support (P = .03). There was a trend for slightly lower survival at 1 year in patients with percutaneous lead infections during LVAD support versus no infection (75% vs 89%; P = .07). Post-cardiac transplant survival in patients supported with continuous-flow devices such as the HeartMate II LVAD is equivalent to that with conventional transplantation. Furthermore, posttransplant survival is not influenced by the duration of LVAD support. The improved durability and reduced short- and long-term morbidity associated with the HeartMate II LVAD has reduced the need for urgent cardiac transplantation, which may have adversely influenced survival in the pulsatile LVAD era.

The development of renal failure is one of the most important problems after heart transplantation (HT), but the wide range of definitions means that estimates of its prevalence vary considerably. Furthermore, its impact on mortality has not been adequately studied. The objective was to investigate the relationship between the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 1 year after transplantation and mortality during follow-up. The GFR was determined in 316 patients still living 1 year after transplantation using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study formula. Patients were divided into three groups according to GFR (i.e. <30, 30-59 and > or =60 mL/min per 1.73 m2) and pretransplant variables and rejection and infection rates within the first year were analyzed. The association between GFR at 1 year and mortality during follow-up was evaluated and reasons for the association were examined. There was no difference in the number of rejections or infections in the first year between the three groups. During a mean follow-up period of 6.3 years, 74% of patients with a GFR <30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 died, compared with 24% and 30% of those with a GFR > or =60 and 30-59 mL/min per 1.73 m2, respectively. Survival analysis (i.e. Cox regression analysis) demonstrated a significant difference between patients with a GFR <30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 and other patients (P< .001). A very low GFR at 1 year was the only independent predictor that remained statistically significant on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio =2.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-5.41).

The peak VO(2) and the HFSS have previously been shown to effectively risk stratify patients with chronic heart failure and are criteria for the listing for heart transplantation. However, the effect of race on the predictive value of these variables has not been studied. A total of 715 patients with congestive heart failure (433 European American, 126 African American, 123 Hispanic American, and 33 other), who had been referred for heart transplantation, underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing with measurement of the peak VO(2) and calculation of the HFSS. A total of 354 patients had died or undergone urgent heart transplantation or implantation of a left ventricular assist device during the 962 +/- 912 days of follow-up. On univariate and multivariate Cox hazard analysis, both peak VO(2) and the HFSS were powerful prognostic markers in the overall cohort and in the separate races. In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the areas under the curve at 1 and 2 years of follow-up were greater for the HFSS than for peak VO(2). In conclusion, HFSS and peak VO(2) can be used for transplant selection; however, in the era of modern therapy and across races and genders, the HFSS might perform better than the peak VO(2).

University of Pittsburgh maintains a data base, from the time of the inception of the program, of all recipients and donors. There is an increasing trend to do double-lung transplantation, as 5- and 10-year survival is better with double than single lungs. Our experience with heart-lung transplantation is considerable. The 4 most common indications for lung transplantation are: chronic obstructive disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), cystic fibrosis (CF) and pulmonary arterial hypertension. (PAH). Potential recipients are evaluated over 2 weeks. There is also a pathway for accelerated evaluation of sicker patients. Our recipient criteria are expanded and flexible; as many patients, who have been denied lung transplantation, at other major centers have been successfully transplanted by us with good outcomes. The median waiting time on the list in 2009 was 37 days. Our altruistic flexibility in recipient selection, balanced with respect to the altruistic gift of donor families, has been described in considerable detail. To solve the problem of shortage of donor lungs, we have expanded our donor selection criteria beyond the historic ideal donor, without comprising on outcomes. These selection criteria and our donor-lungs management protocol are also described in reasonable detail. We started using lungs from donors after cardiac death (DCD) in January 2007. Recently we reviewed our experience and literature, and devised a protocol; which is given in a robust table. We also participate as faculty in the educational program initiated by the Organ Procurement Organizations (OPO) of Pennsylvania. During procurement we use 500 microg of prostaglandin E-1 into the pulmonary artery just before X clamp, Perfedex infusion after X-clamp, at 70 ml/kg, with 500 microg of prostaglandin and 50 mg of nitroglycerine in the first bag, and retrograde flush of 500 ccs in each pulmonary vein. We have refined our recipient operation, from clam shell incision to bilateral antero-axillary incisions, preserving the sternum and internal mammary arteries, for both double and single-lung transplantation, with good outcomes. This technique and results have been described in generous detail. We use pneumoplegia, similar to cardioplegia, to protect the allograft from ischemic and reperfusion injury (Appendix III). Our technique of bronchial anastomosis and intraoperative management of septic lung disease has remained unchanged. Post-operatively we continue to use the ventilatory management of low FiO2 and high PEEP. Our immunosuppression and infection prophylaxis protocol is the same since 2003, when we started using Alemtuzumab (Campath) for induction, with minimization of the use of steroids. For maintenance, we use Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate Mofetil. Now, we also monitor the functional activity of the T cell by Cylex ImmuKnow. Lowered activity (< 100 ng/ml) suggests an increased risk of infection; and higher activity (> 200 ng/ml) suggests greater risks for rejection. Although we have expanded our recipient and donor pools, our outcomes have continued to improve. The overall survival of double-lung transplantation from 2003-2009 was 82.8% at one year and 56.8% at 5 years.

In this study we review urgency-based allocation policy for HTx candidates with ventricular assist devices (VADs). We retrospectively studied 345 adult candidates for de novo HTx. Group U (n = 160) comprised patients primarily listed in urgent status without VAD. Group VAD-45 (n = 167) comprised patients with intended bridging to HTx who survived >45 days after VAD implantation (after initial drop in survival rates). Among these patients, those who died of stroke or were awarded urgent status due to difficulties of coagulation management (thrombus formation, thromboembolism and bleeding) in the first year after VAD implantation were assigned to Group COAG (n = 36), and those who died or were awarded urgent status due to device-related infection in the same period were assigned to Group INF (n = 31). Actuarial survival rates were studied in each group. Survival rates during support in Group VAD-45 were comparable to those during urgent status in Group U. Bridge-to-transplant rate was 63.9% in Group COAG and 58.1% in Group INF. The post-transplant 3-year survival rate of 85.3% in Group COAG was significantly higher than that in Group INF (46.8%, p < 0.01) and Group U (62.4%, p < 0.05). Patients who have a VAD for >45 days should be awarded some priority for urgent HTx, which is currently prohibited in Germany.

BACKGROUND; Several studies have demonstrated the utility of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the months following cardiac transplant. The purpose of this study was to analyze longitudinal BNP data in pediatric cardiac transplant patients and determine the efficacy of BNP in routine follow-up of transplant to help predict the adverse event of death or re-transplant. From October 2002 to July 2007, 53 pediatric cardiac transplant patients were treated in an unmatched case-control study. Along with routine studies, BNP values were obtained at regular intervals. Six patients were excluded due to recent transplant, and three patients were excluded due to poor compliance. A baseline BNP was established for each subject utilizing the mean of all BNP values during year 2 post-transplant, or the first year of measured BNP in those patients whose transplant preceded the study by more than 1 year (time from transplant to first BNP 7.0 +/- 3.5 years). The median BNP of all data points since transplant was utilized as an additional surrogate baseline. Univariate logistic regression was used to evaluate BNP versus other covariates on cardiac death. Forty-four patients provided 1254 BNP data points spanning 173 patient years. Nine (20.5%) had an adverse event. Patients who experienced an adverse event had a higher baseline BNP (mean 365 +/- 290; median 375 +/- 352)) when compared to patients without an event (mean 128 +/- 78; median 121 +/- 62; p = 0.04 and p = 0.06)). All subjects with adverse events had a BNP value >or= 250 during the 90 days preceding the event compared to 32.4% of those who did not (odds ratio: 23.13, p < 0.01). A log fold increase in the BNP value compared to the baseline median BNP is a risk for cardiac death in the subsequent 90-day period (OR: 6.82, 95% confidence interval: 1.25-37.11, p = 0.03). Routine BNP monitoring in the post-cardiac transplant pediatric patient allows for the determination of a median BNP, which can be used as a baseline. A log fold increase from the median BNP, or a BNP value >or= 250, increases the risk of death or re-transplant and suggests a 90-day period of heightened clinical surveillance, perhaps necessitating increased medication or re-listing for repeat transplant.

Ventricular assist devices (VADs) provide effective treatment for end-stage heart failure; however, most patients experience > or =1 major adverse events (AEs) while on VAD support. Although early, non-fatal AEs may increase the risk of later death during VAD support, this relationship has not been established. Therefore, we sought to determine the impact on 1-year mortality of AEs occurring during the first 60 days of VAD support. A retrospective analysis was performed using prospectively collected data from a single-site database for patients aged > or =18 years receiving left ventricular or biventricular support during 1996 to 2008 and who survived >60 days on VAD support. Fourteen major classes of AEs occurring during this 60-day period were examined. One-year survival rates of patients with and without each major AE were compared. The study included 163 patients (80% men; mean age, 49.5 years), of whom 87% were European American, 72% had left ventricular support, and 83% were bridge to transplant. The occurrence of renal failure, respiratory failure, bleeding events, and reoperations during the first 60 days after implantation significantly increased the risk of 1-year mortality. After controlling for gender, age, VAD type, and intention to treat, renal failure was the only major AE significantly associated with later mortality (hazard ratio, 2.96; p = .023). Specific AEs, including renal failure, respiratory and bleeding events, and reoperations, significantly decrease longer-term survival. Renal failure conferred a 3-fold increased risk of 1-year mortality. Peri-operative management should focus on strategies to mitigate risk for renal failure in order to maximize later outcomes.

Most studies of anastomotic technique have been underpowered to detect subtle differences in survival. We analyzed the United Network for Organ Sharing database for trends in use and outcomes after either bicaval or traditional (biatrial) anastomoses for heart implantation. Review of United Network for Organ Sharing data identified 20,999 recipients of heart transplants from 1997 to 2007. Patients were stratified based on the technique of atrial anastomosis: standard biatrial (atrial group, n = 11,919, 59.3%), bicaval (caval group, n = 7661, 38.1%), or total orthotopic (total group, n = 519, 2.6%). The use of the bicaval anastomosis is increasing, but many transplantations continue to use a biatrial anastomosis (1997, 0.2% vs 97.6%; 2007, 62.0% vs 34.7%; P < .0001). Atrial group patients required permanent pacemaker implantation more often (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 2.2-3.1). Caval group patients had a significant advantage in 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.75-0.93), and Cox regression analysis confirmed the decreased long-term survival in the atrial group (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.19). Heart transplantations performed with bicaval anastomoses require postoperative permanent pacemaker implantation at lower frequency and have a small but significant survival advantage compared with biatrial anastomoses. We recommend that except where technical considerations require a biatrial technique, bicaval anastomoses should be performed for heart transplantation.

Some of the 600,000 patients with solid organ allotransplants need reconstruction with a composite tissue allotransplant, such as the hand, abdominal wall, or face. The aim of this study was to develop a rat model for assessing the effects of a secondary composite tissue allotransplant on a primary heart allotransplant. Hearts of Wistar Kyoto rats were harvested and transplanted heterotopically to the neck of recipient Fisher 344 rats. The anastomoses were performed between the donor brachiocephalic artery and the recipient left common carotid artery, and between the donor pulmonary artery and the recipient external jugular vein. Recipients received cyclosporine A for 10 days only. Heart rate was assessed noninvasively. The sequential composite tissue allotransplant consisted of a 3 x 3-cm abdominal musculocutaneous flap harvested from Lewis rats and transplanted to the abdomen of the heart allotransplant recipients. The abdominal flap vessels were connected to the femoral vessels. No further immunosuppression was administered following the composite tissue allotransplant. Ten days after composite tissue allotransplantation, rejection of the heart and abdominal flap was assessed histologically. The rat survival rate of the two-stage transplant surgery was 80 percent. The transplanted heart rate decreased from 150 +/- 22 beats per minute immediately after transplant to 83 +/- 12 beats per minute on day 20 (10 days after stopping immunosuppression). This sequential allotransplant model is technically demanding. It will facilitate investigation of the effects of a secondary composite tissue allotransplant following primary solid organ transplantation and could be useful in developing future immunotherapeutic strategies.

Posttransplantation in-hospital survival rate was 100%. At a mean follow-up of 58 months (range, 1.6-145), 3 deaths occurred, yielding an overall survival rate of 70%. Only 1 death (10%) was linked to accelerated acute hepatitis. Transplant coronary artery disease was detected in 2 patients (20%). Echocardiograms of survivors at last follow-up revealed normal ejection fractions. In addition, there were no cases of hepatocellular carcinoma; all survivors were without evidence of hepatic dysfunction.

Primary graft failure (PGF) is the most common cause of short-term mortality after cardiac transplantation. The low prevalence of PGF has limited efforts at identifying risk factors for its development. The purpose of this study was to evaluate risk factors associated with PGF after heart transplantation. Deidentified data were obtained from United Network for Organ Sharing. Analysis included heart transplant recipients more than or equal to 18 years transplanted between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2007 (n=16,716). PGF was studied from the perspective of \"hard outcomes\" including death or retransplantation within 90 days of transplant due to graft failure, not related to rejection or infection. Multivariate regression analysis was performed (backward, remove P>0.15) to assess the simultaneous effect of multiple variables on PGF. The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were reported for each factor. Among the 414 heart transplants complicated by PGF, 354 (85.5%) recipients died and 60 (14.5%) were retransplanted. PGF accounted for 23.4% (n=364) of all deaths (n=1555) in the first 90 days posttransplant. Categories of pretransplant variables associated with PGF included: ischemic time, donor gender, donor age, multiorgan donation, center volume, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, mechanical circulatory support, etiology of heart failure, and reoperative heart transplant. The area under the receiver operative characteristic curve for the multivariate model was 0.764 (0.733-0.796). Pretransplant recipient and donor characteristics are associated with PGF. Identification of risk factors may aid in understanding the mechanisms underlying PGF and in matching recipients with donors in efforts to diminish the high mortality associated with this complication.

Most deaths in the first 30 days after cardiac transplantation are due to failure of the donor heart, often with the clinical picture of right ventricular failure. Indeed, there is a significant reduction in contractility of the human donor heart and loss of contractile reserve before and soon after transplantation. This myocardial insult appears in association with brain death in the donor and follows a \"catecholamine storm\" associated with a rapidly rising intracranial pressure. Microscopy of the myocardium in organ donors shows a picture typical of catecholamine-induced injury and similar to changes found in endomyocardial specimens of stress cardiomyopathy (catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy, or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy). There are 3 common features between stress cardiomyopathy and the heart of a brain-dead donor: exposure of the heart to unusually high catecholamine levels, ventricular dysfunction, and prompt recovery. Stress cardiomyopathy is a temporary myocardial dysfunction that has been described after sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic head injury, pheochromocytoma, acute emotional distress, exogenous administration of catecholamines, and non-related surgery. Given the common features of this catecholamine-mediated myocardial insult, we ask if brain-dead donor heart dysfunction is an extreme variant of stress cardiomyopathy? And, if so is it, like stress cardiomyopathy, reversible? Can we therefore expect recovery of the dysfunctional donor heart over time, thereby permitting increased use of hearts offered for transplantation?

Immunosuppressive drugs (ISDs) have a major impact on the development and progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), the main cause of cardiac allograft loss and a leading cause of death beyond the 1st post-transplant year. The influence of ISDs on the development and progression of CAV is complex. In spite of their high potency to suppress the alloimmune response (prevention of allograft rejection) which plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of CAV, the immunosuppressive regimens which were used in the past were not able to entirely prevent the development of CAV. This can be explained by the fact that several non-alloimmune insults such as brain death, organ preservation, surgical trauma, ischemia-reperfusion, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cytomegalovirus infection etc. are also involved in the development or progression of CAV. Some of these insults are not affected by immunosuppression, whereas others can be even aggravated by certain ISDs, particularly by calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), but also by glucocorticosteroids and proliferation signal inhibitors (PSIs). Certain ISDs, especially CNIs, also have direct toxic effects on vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells inducing endothelial dysfunction and proliferation of both smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts which promotes the development and progression of CAV. Other ISDs like PSIs and mycophenolate mofetil appeared able to delay the onset of CAV and reduce its progression, especially by their inhibitory effects on smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation.

During a 2-year follow-up, 234 patients (19%) died, and 208 (17%) required urgent transplantation. BNP (odds ratio 4.3, 95% confidence interval 3.3 to 5.5) and peak VO(2) (odds ratio 4.5, 95% confidence interval 2.6 to 7.8) were the strongest predictors for death or urgent transplantation. On multivariate analyses, BNP and peak VO(2) were the strongest predictors for both death or urgent transplantation and all-cause mortality. The c-statistic was 0.756 for BNP, 0.701 for VO(2), 0.659 for BUN, 0.638 for SBP, and 0.650 for pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. In conclusion, of the 5 established predictors of outcomes in advanced HF, BNP was the most robust discriminator of risk and thus could be useful, along with other more traditional prognostic variables, in patient counseling regarding prognosis and determining the timing for heart transplantation.

Proliferation signal inhibitors may adversely impact bone marrow function. We sought to describe the impact of sirolimus on hemoglobin and erythropoiesis in heart transplant recipients. We have conducted a single-center, retrospective analysis of all heart transplant patients treated with sirolimus. We measured serum hemoglobin (Hb) at baseline and at 3 months to determine the prevalence of anemia and change in Hb after sirolimus initiation. We also characterized hematologic profile of patients to gain insights into the effects of sirolimus on erythropoiesis. There were 84 patients included in the study. The prevalence of anemia increased from 71% to 75% after sirolimus initiation. Anemic patients were more likely to be male (P = .026) and have worse renal function (glomerular filtration rate 49 \u00b1 27 vs 70 \u00b1 42 mL/min; P = .012).

Threshold analysis identified 3 discrete risk groups of transplant recipients: high-risk, moderate-risk, and low-risk. Three discrete risk strata for center volume: low (<10.5 recipients/yr), intermediate (10.5 to 47 recipients/yr), and high (>47 recipients/yr) were also identified. \u03c7(2) test was used to compare 1-year survival at low- and intermediate- with high-volume centers. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, annual center volume was significantly associated with posttransplant graft survival at 1 year (odds ratio [OR]=0.995, 0.992 to 0.999; P=0.010) and primary graft failure (OR=0.985, 0.972 to 0.997; P=0.015), but not stroke (OR=0.996, 0.990 to 1.003; P=0.295), infection (OR=1.001, 0.998 to 1.003; P=0.613), or dialysis (OR=1.001, 0.997 to 1.005; P=0.522).

In Germany, cardiac rehabilitation started early after an index event, could demonstrate a significant reduction of total mortality, myocardial infarction and hospitalization during a follow-up of 1-2 years in 4 cohort studies including 10,758 patients with myocardial infarction and bypass surgery. This reduction of clinical events was obtained in addition to rapid revascularization therapy during the acute coronary event and on top of an evidence based secondary preventive medication. By national and international medical societies, cardiac rehabilitation is recommended as well in patients with congestive heart failure, after valve replacement or valve repair, after heart transplantation and cardioverter/defibrillator implantation.

Recent efforts are being undertaken to update and refine current diagnostic criteria for antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in heart transplantation. We believe that the appropriate reactants are those that best predict the adverse consequences of AMR and therefore tested various models using different reactants to find the best predictors of cardiovascular mortality in pathologically defined AMR. The study group included only patients in whom all immunofluorescence antibodies of interest had been tested on biopsy specimens obtained after 2002 when C4d was routinely added. We analyzed our data using 3 Cox proportional hazard models with time-varying covariates using an end point of cardiovascular mortality, as previously defined. In 3,712 biopsy specimens from 422 patients, the 2-antibody model achieved a value of R(2) = 0.930 using C3d and C4d antibodies alone. A model that used 4 antibodies--C3d, C4d, human leukocyte antigen-D related (HLA-DR) and fibrin--was superior (R(2) = 0.988). The model that best predicted cardiovascular mortality included all 6 antibodies: HLA-DR, immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgM, C3d, C4d, and fibrin (R(2) = 0.989). The models using 4 or 6 antibodies were significantly superior to the model using only C3d and C4d (for each interaction, p < 0.0001). The combination of complement components, HLA-DR and fibrin, is valuable in defining AMR in patients at risk for allograft loss from cardiovascular causes. Fibrin is particularly important for detecting the presence of severe AMR, with a high likelihood of poor long-term patient outcome.

Pediatric heart transplantation involves many challenges not frequently encountered in the adult population. Several unique issues include the large variation in cardiac configuration in congenital heart disease, limited availability of mechanical circulatory assist devices, immature immune responses, and consideration of somatic growth. Nevertheless, significant improvement in survival outcomes has been achieved in the last two decades, mainly from the decreased mortality early after transplantation. A severe shortage of donor hearts is the most serious problem, especially in infants who cannot be supported by assist devices. The use of ABO-incompatible or after-cardiac-death donors is under investigation to maximize the available organ pool. Long-term survival is still limited mainly by graft coronary artery vasculopathy, although its incidence is less than in the adult population. Further efforts are required to increase available donors, overcome graft coronary artery vasculopathy, and improve pretransplantation management including the development of pediatric mechanical circulatory support devices.

In this study, we examine the role of Treg in cardiac allograft acceptance induced by blockade of the CD40-CD40L pathway. A heterotopic heart transplant model of major histocompatibility complex-mismatched mice was performed. Expression of forkhead/winged helix transcription factor (FoxP3) and/or the number of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells in allografts and spleens were examined. The effect of Treg from the recipient or the donor on the induction and maintenance of long-term allograft survival was determined. Histologic analyses were also performed. The effects of Treg on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were assessed. The levels of FoxP3 and/or CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells increased in long-surviving allografts and spleens. Depletion of Treg in the recipients but not the donors before transplantation caused rejection. Histologic analyses of allografts with Treg depletion showed extensive leukocyte infiltration and tissue destruction. However, delayed depletion of Treg in long-surviving recipients did not shorten their survival. Treg depletion increased the function of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Treg in the recipient but not in the donor is essential for long-term survival induced by CD40-CD40L blockade by inhibiting the function of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells; however, Treg are not important for maintenance.

A composite SE score was derived for each child and four groups (quartiles) compared for graft loss (death or retransplant). Graft loss occurred in 152 children (122 deaths, 30 retransplant). In adjusted analysis, graft loss during the first posttransplant year had a borderline association with the highest SE quartile (HR 1.94, p = 0.05) but not with race.

Risk factors for death from rejection included age (p < 0.0001), female gender (p = 0.0001), black race (p < 0.0001) and transplant date (p < 0.0001); for infection death, risk factors were age (p < 0.0001), date of transplant (p < 0.0001), age (p = 0.002) and black race (p = 0.01). Modeling with respect to age at time of transplant showed an inverse relationship between infection and rejection death. Among patients transplanted at >60 years of age, there was a steep increase in infection-related deaths and a decrease in rejection deaths. Risk for rejection was elevated among young adults 10 to 30 years of age at time of transplant, particularly for black females.

Sequential samples of sera were obtained from 950 recipients of heart allografts before and after transplantation at the time when protocol endomyocardial biopsies were performed. The presence of anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies was investigated using complement mediated cytotoxicity and solid phase assay (SPA). Our data reveal an inverse correlation between the development of alloantibodies after transplantation and heart allograft survival. The 15-year graft survival was highest in patients who never developed alloantibodies (70%) or who displayed them only before transplantation (71%); graft survival in recipients who showed antibodies both before and after transplantation (56%), or only after transplantation (47%), was lower. The deleterious effect of antibodies on graft survival started 8 years after transplantation, suggesting that the production of de novo antibodies may have been triggered by some later event. We found that patients with de novo antibodies appearing more than 1 year after transplantation had the poorest survival. Furthermore, the development of de novo antibodies was preceded in 76% of these patients by cellular rejection grade 3 or higher, according to the International Society for Heart Transplantation (ISHT) grading criteria.

Survival after pediatric heart transplant has improved over time, as has the incidence of overall rejection. We studied the effect of era on the occurrence and outcome of rejection with hemodynamic compromise (HC). Data from 2227 patients who received allografts between 1993 and 2006 at 36 centers in the Pediatric Heart Transplant Study were analyzed to determine incidence, outcome, and risk factors for rejection with HC in early (1993-1999) and recent (2000-2006) eras. Rejection with HC was classified as severe (RSHC) when inotropes were used for circulatory support and mild (RMHC) when inotropes were not used. Of 1217 patients with any episode of rejection, 541 had rejection with HC. Freedom from RMHC improved at 1 year (81% vs 90%, p < 0.001) and at 5 years (74% vs 85%, p < 0.001) in the early vs recent eras, but freedom from RSHC was similar between eras (93% vs 95% at 1 year and 85% vs 87% at 5 years, p = 0.24).

Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) now survive into adulthood and often present with end-stage heart failure (HF). HF management and approach to orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) may differ from adults without CHD. We sought to compare OHT waitlist characteristics and outcomes for these 2 groups. The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)/United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was used to identify adults (\u226518 years) listed for OHT from 2005 to 2009. The cohort was divided into those with or without CHD. Of 9,722 adults included, 314 (3%) had CHD. Adults with CHD were younger (35 \u00b1 13 vs 52 \u00b1 12 years, p < 0.01) and more often had undergone prior cardiac surgery (85% vs. 34%, p < 0.01). Patients with CHD were less likely to have a defibrillator (44% vs 75%, p < 0.01) or ventricular assist device (5% vs 14%, p < 0.01) and were more likely to be listed at the lowest urgency status than patients without CHD (64% vs 44%, p < 0.01).

Despite lower urgency status, patients with CHD have greater cardiovascular mortality awaiting OHT than those without. Increased defibrillator use could improve survival to OHT, because sudden death is common. VAD support may benefit select patients, but experience in CHD is limited.

CMVIG (with or without antivirals) versus no prophylaxis was also assessed in the CMV-positive donor/CMV-negative recipient cohort. Data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients included patients with a transplant date between January 1995 and October 2008; follow-up data were through March 2009. All pediatric (younger than 18 years) recipients of primary, single-organ heart transplants were included. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to examine rates of recipient death and graft loss at 7 years posttransplantation. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate adjusted risk for graft loss and death. CMVIG (with or without antivirals) and antivirals without CMVIG were both associated with significantly (P\u22640.05) lower rates of graft loss and death versus no prophylaxis.

Infants undergoing heart transplantation have the highest early posttransplant mortality of any age group. We sought to determine the pretransplantation factors associated with in-hospital mortality in transplanted infants in the current era. All infants under 12 months of age who underwent primary heart transplantation during a recent 10-year period (1999-2009) in the United States were identified using the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network database. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent pretransplantation factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Of 730 infants in the study (median age 3.8 months), 462 (63%) had congenital heart disease, 282 (39%) were supported by a ventilator, 94 (13%) with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and 22 (3%) with a ventricular assist device at the time of transplantation. Overall, 82 (11.2%) infants died before their initial hospital discharge. In adjusted analysis, in-hospital mortality was associated with repaired congenital heart disease (odds ratio [OR], 3.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8, 7.2), unrepaired congenital heart disease not on prostaglandin E (OR, 2.8; CI, 1.3, 6.1), extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support (OR, 6.1; CI, 2.8, 13.4), ventilator support (OR, 4.4; CI, 2.3, 8.3), creatinine clearance less than 40 mL\u00b7min(-1)\u00b71.73 m(-2) (OR, 3.1; CI, 1.7, 5.3), and dialysis (OR, 6.2; CI, 2.1, 18.3) at transplantation. One in 9 infants undergoing heart transplantation dies before hospital discharge. Pretranplantation factors associated with early mortality include congenital heart disease, extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support, mechanical ventilation, and renal failure. Risk stratification for early posttransplant mortality among infants listed for heart transplantation may improve decision-making for transplant eligibility, organ allocation, and posttransplant interventions to reduce mortality.

Patients who did and did not respond to acute vasodilator testing and patients who underwent transplant before (pre-1995) and after (post-1995) the availability of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) were compared. The pre-transplant diagnoses, and cardiopulmonary bypass and donor ischemic times were similar between the high and low PVRI groups. High PVRI patients were older at transplant (12 \u00b1 6.2 vs 8 \u00b1 7.1 years, p = 0.002). The post-transplant inotrope score was higher in the high PVRI group (12 \u00b1 12 vs 2 \u00b1 2, p = 0.0001) and 1-year survival was worse (76% vs 81%, p = 0.03).

One responder (5%) and 4 non-responders (14%) died of RV failure. In the period after 1995, the year iNO became clinically available, the select group of high PVRI patients who received iNO preemptively had a lower incidence of post-transplant RV failure than the group that did not receive preemptive iNO (13% vs 54%, p = 0.04). Pre-transplant vasodilator testing identified patients at higher risk for RV failure.

Comparisons were made with 792 primary transplantations. Subsequent retransplantations (third and fourth time) were elective and included in the evaluation. Twenty-three patients electively received a second, 4 a third, and 1 a fourth transplant for coronary vasculopathy or chronic graft failure. Sixteen (70%) patients were men, and 7 (30%) were women. Median survival in years for primary cardiac recipients was 10.7 years; for a second transplantation, median survival from the date of retransplantation was 9.3 years.

This group of patients presents multiple unique surgical and medical challenges to transplantation owing to their complex anatomy, multiple prior palliative and corrective procedures, frequently increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and often debilitated condition. Consequently, transplantation in adults with congenital heart disease is associated with a relatively high operative mortality secondary to increased bleeding, infection, and graft failure rates compared with noncongenital heart disease transplant recipients.

LVAD for BTT was used in 29 patients (51.4\u00b112.8 years, 6.9% women), and 13 (51.1\u00b111.6 years, 15.38% women) underwent heart transplantation. Initial hospital length of stay was 17.5\u00b114.4 days in BTT group and 14.3\u00b14.6 days in heart transplant group (p=0.44) At 1 year, the total number of days spent in the hospital (operation and related complications), including index hospitalization was 11.6\u00b114.3 days/100 days in BTT and 7.9\u00b19.0 days/100 days in heart transplantation (p=0.38). A total of 41% BTT and 46% heart transplant patients had one readmission within 3 months of the index hospitalization. Infection was the most common cause of readmission in both groups. The 1-year survival was similar for both groups (no hospital death in either group; 3 late deaths in the BTT group). One-year outcomes for patients eligible for heart transplantation were similar whether they received an allograft or LVAD for BTT. Heart transplant outcome for patients with LVAD were not adversely affected. Improving outcomes for patients treated with LVAD suggest that current decision models for patients eligible for heart transplantation may need to be reevaluated.

Induction therapy with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) after heart transplantation (HTx) has never been assessed in a placebo-controlled randomized trial. We investigated trends in use of ATG and its relationship to outcome after HTx in a national cohort. Between July 1995 and March 2008, 2,151 adult HTxs were performed. Patients given OKT3 or an interleukin-2 receptor antagonist, repeat transplants, heterotopic, and multi-organ transplants were excluded, leaving 2,086 HTx for analysis. Of these, 1,143 (55%) received induction with ATG. The proportion of patients given ATG increased from 26% in June 1995 to 75% in August 2007 (p < 0.01). The age and gender distributions of recipients and donors were similar in the ATG and non-ATG groups. Survival to 10 years was similar: 56.2% in the non-ATG group vs 55.9% in the ATG group (p = 0.95). The number of treated rejection episodes in the first year was lower in the ATG group (incidence rate ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-0.85, p < 0.01), but the number of infective episodes was higher (incidence rate ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.00-1.39, p = 0.048), and these differences remained after risk adjustment, with an adjusted incidence rate ratio of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.75-0.95, p < 0.01) and 1.21 (95% CI, 1.02-1.44; p = 0.027). Deaths due to infective causes were higher in the ATG group (p = 0.03). There has been a trend towards an increased use of induction therapy.

Racial and ethnic disparities are well documented in many areas of health care, but have not been comprehensively evaluated among recipients of heart transplants. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 39075 adult primary heart transplant recipients from 1987 to 2009 using national data from the United Network of Organ Sharing and compared mortality for nonwhite and white patients using the Cox proportional hazards model. During the study period, 8082 nonwhite and 30 993 white patients underwent heart transplantation. Nonwhite heart transplant recipients increased over time, comprising nearly 30% of transplantations since 2005. Nonwhite recipients had a higher clinical risk profile than white recipients at the time of transplantation, but had significantly higher posttransplantation mortality even after adjustment for baseline risk. Among the nonwhite group, only black recipients had an increased risk of death compared with white recipients after multivariable adjustment for recipient, transplant, and socioeconomic factors (hazard ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.21 to 1.47; P<0.001). Five-year mortality was 35.7% (95% confidence interval, 35.2 to 38.3) among black and 26.5% (95% confidence interval, 26.0 to 27.0) among white recipients. Black patients were more likely to die of graft failure or a cardiovascular cause than white patients, but less likely to die of infection or malignancy. Although mortality decreased over time for all transplant recipients, the disparity in mortality between blacks and whites remained essentially unchanged. Black heart transplant recipients have had persistently higher mortality than whites recipients over the past 2 decades, perhaps because of a higher rate of graft failure.

Because patients who receive a marginal heart may require hemodynamic support in the early post-operative period, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be used until recovery of acute graft dysfunction. A retrospective file review of 124 primary adult heart transplant patients from 2003 to 2008 was conducted. We compared 17 patients who received post-transplant ECMO support with 107 transplant recipients without ECMO. Donor and recipient pre-transplant, intra-operative, and post-transplant clinical variables to 6 months after transplant were compared. Pre-operative demographics of the 2 groups were similar. Eight (47%) of the patients in the ECMO group received marginal donor hearts, compared with 1 (1%) in the non-ECMO group (p < 0.05). There were 3 early deaths in the ECMO group (2 of whom had received optimal donor hearts), resulting in lower Day 30 ECMO survival of 82.4% vs 100% for non-ECMO, respectively (p < 0.001), and 6-month survival of 82.4% vs 95.6%, respectively (p < 0.02). Most of the difference in survival was in patients who required salvage ECMO despite normal pre-transplant donor LV function. The rate of early dialysis was higher in the ECMO group, at 18% vs 6% at Day 3, but there was no difference between the 2 groups by Day 7. Pre-discharge ventricular function was normal in all discharged ECMO patients and all but 1 non-ECMO patient. ECMO patients had a longer intensive care unit stay (8.9 \u00b1 3.4 vs 4.8 \u00b1 5.4 days, p < 0.005), but there was a slightly shorter ward stay, resulting in a similar overall hospitalization length of stay (22.9 \u00b1 8.3 vs 25.1 \u00b1 25.2 days). ECMO allows for salvage of acute graft dysfunction and may allow use of marginal donor hearts. Survival rates are lower in patients who require ECMO compared with optimal donors, but early cardiac dysfunction normalizes in most without long-term cardiac or renal sequelae.

Between February 1998 and September 2010, we transplanted 140 patients with a mean age of 40 \u00b1 13 years, including 109 men (77.8%) and 31 women (22%). There were 101 patients (73%) with dilated cardiomyopathy and 39 (27%) with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Two patients were retransplanted owing to graft failure. Sixteen patients on assist device support were successfully bridged to transplantation. Eighteen patients (12.8%) died within 30 days with the most common causes being right ventricular failure (8/18, 44%) and infection (4/18, 22%). Overall mortality of 39% (55/140) was most commonly caused by infection (29%, 16/55) or right ventricular failure (20%, 11/55). Nine patients (16%) died suddenly outside of the hospital. Three patients died of rejection; 4 of graft failure, and 4 of malignant disease. Heart transplantation remains the standard treatment modality for end-stage cardiac failure. But significant waiting list mortality rates are due to the worldwide shortage of donors.

Here, we describe the UK experience with Levitronix CentriMag support following heart transplantation across multiple centres. Data for all adult heart transplants and all CentriMag devices used within 30 days of heart transplantation in the UK between November 2003 and July 2008 were collected. Transplant characteristics were compared for those who did and did not receive CentriMag support, and device outcomes and survival rates were summarised. A total of 572 heart transplants were performed in this period. As many as 38 patients (6.6%) were implanted with CentriMag devices for primary graft failure. Four patients received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation concurrently and were excluded from further analysis. There were no significant differences in transplant characteristics between the patients who received CentriMag support and those who did not. Twelve patients were explanted; nine survived but three died shortly afterwards. Five underwent acute retransplantation; two survived and three died. Seventeen patients died on support.

From February 2005 to September 2009, 11 patients (i-ECMO group) receiving allografts with LITs >7 hours underwent intraoperative ECMO circuit strategy with routine extension of ECMO into postoperative period. Eleven contemporary patients (s-CPB group) received ECMO support after standard CPB at the various intervals after the transplantation as a salvage therapy. Overall weaning rate was 86.4%; overall 30-day and 1-year survival rates were 81.8% and 72.7%, respectively. There was no difference in mortality between the two groups. Length of stay in the intensive care unit, the requirement for packed red blood cells administration and the total in-hospital cost were significantly reduced in i-ECMO group patients (P<0.05). The salvage of failing cardiac allograft with ECMO allows effective stabilization of the hemodynamic and leads toward myocardial recovery. Extending ECMO into postoperative period provides early, continues and effective support for donor hearts with LITs and maximizes the use of such marginal organs.

From our institutional database, 76 patients (57 men and 19 women) who developed giant aneurysms after January 1, 1972, were identified. Information on patient demographics, catheter and surgical interventions, and most recent status was collected from medical charts and patients' contacts. From these data, we calculated the survival rate and cumulative coronary intervention rate. The average age at onset was 2.9\u00b12.9 years, and the median observational period was 19 years. During this period, 7 patients died and 1 patient underwent a heart transplantation, resulting in 95%, 88%, and 88% survival rates at 10, 20, and 30 years after the onset of KD, respectively.

Heart transplantation (HT) is an attractive treatment for patients with terminal heart failure from a variety of causes. Survival at 1- and 5 years after HT averages 90% and 70%, respectively. The physiologic response to exercise is abnormal after HT presumably because the transplanted heart is surgically denervated, although a minority of patients demonstrate signs of partial cardiac reinnervation several months after surgery. The heart rate response to exercise is typically blunted, and exercise capacity is below average for most HT recipients. Multiple studies have demonstrated the benefits of exercise training (ET) after HT. Peak exercise oxygen uptake improves by an average of 24% after 2 to 3 months of ET. Resistance training results in increased skeletal muscle mass and strength. Early mobilization and low-level ET may begin in the hospital after extubation. Outpatient ET, ideally in a supervised environment for at least several weeks, should begin immediately after hospital dismissal. Exercise prescription for HT patients is similar to that for other patients who have undergone cardiothoracic surgery, with the exception of a target heart rate.

In heart transplants, the significance of very late rejection (after 7 years post-transplant, VLR) detected by routine endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) remains uncertain. Here, we assessed the prevalence, histopathological and immunological phenotype, and outcome of VLR in clinically stable patients. Between 1985 and 2009, 10 662 protocol EMB were performed at our institution in 398 consecutive heart transplants recipients. Among the 196 patients with >7-year follow-up, 20 (10.2%) presented subclinical \u22653A/2R-ISHLT rejection. The VLR group was compared to a matched control group of patients without rejection. All biopsies were stained for C4d/C3d/CD68 with sera screened for the presence of donor-specific antibodies (DSAs). In addition to cellular infiltrates with myocyte damage, 60% of VLR patients had evidence of intravascular macrophages. C4d and/or C3d-capillary deposition was found in 55% VLR EMB. All cases of VLR associated with microcirculation injury had DSAs (mean DSA(max) -MFI = 1751 \u00b1 583). This entity was absent from the control group (p < 0.0001). Finally, after a similar follow-up postreference EMB of 6.4 \u00b1 1 years, the mean of CAV grade was 0.76 \u00b1 0.18 in the control group compared to 2.06 \u00b1 0.26 in the VLR group respectively, p = 0.001). There was no difference in patient survival between study and control groups. In conclusion, VLR is frequently associated with complement-cascade activation, microvascular injury and DSA, suggesting an antibody-mediated process. VLR is associated with a dramatic progression to severe CAV in long-term follow-up.

Previous studies have found no association between graft ischemic time (IT) and survival in pediatric heart transplant (HTx) recipients. However, previous studies were small or analyzed risk only at the extremes of IT, where observations are few. We sought to determine whether graft IT is independently associated with graft survival in a large cohort of children with no a priori assumptions about where the risk threshold may lie. All children aged <18 years in the U.S. undergoing primary HTx (1987 to 2008) were included. The primary end point was graft loss (death or retransplant) within 6 months. Multivariate analysis was performed to analyze the association between graft IT and graft loss within 6 months after transplant. A secondary end point of longer-term graft loss was assessed among recipients who survived the first 6 months after transplant. Of 4,716 pediatric HTxs performed, the median IT was 3.5 hours (interquartile range, 2.7-4.3 hours). Adjusted analysis showed that children with an IT > 3.5 hours were at increased risk of graft loss within 6 months after transplant (hazard ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.5; p = 0.002). Among 6-month survivors, IT was not associated with longer-term graft loss. IT beyond 3.5 hours is associated with a 30% increase in risk of graft loss within 6 months in pediatric HT recipients. Although the magnitude of risk associated with IT is small compared with the risk associated with recipient factors, these findings may be important during donor assessment for high-risk transplant candidates.

In this study we sought the following: (1) To objectively assess the risk related to various pretransplant recipient and donor characteristics; (2) to devise a preoperative risk stratification score (RSS) based on pretransplant recipient and donor characteristics predicting graft loss at 1 year; and (3) to define different risk strata based on RSS. The United Network for Organ Sharing provided de-identified patient-level data. Analysis included 11,703 orthotopic heart transplant recipients aged 18 years or greater and transplanted between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2007. The primary outcome was 1-year graft failure. Multivariable logistic regression analysis (backward p value<0.20) was used to determine the relationship between pretransplant characteristics and 1-year graft failure. Using the odds ratio for each identified variable, an RSS was devised. The RSS strata were defined by calculating receiver operating characteristic curves and stratum specific likelihood ratios. The strongest negative predictors of 1-year graft failure included the following: right ventricular assist device only, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal failure, extracorporeal left ventricular assist device, total artificial heart, and advanced age. Threshold analysis identified 5 discrete RSS strata: low risk (LR, RSS: <2.55; n=3242, 27.7%), intermediate risk (IR, RSS: 2.55-5.72; n=6,347, 54.2%), moderate risk (MR, RSS: 5.73-8.13; n=1,543, 13.2%), elevated risk (ER, RSS: 8.14-9.48; n=310, 2.6%), and high risk (HR, RSS: >9.48; n=261, 2.2%).

Despite significant advances in cardiac allograft preservation, the optimal preservative solution is unknown. We evaluated the impact of the most commonly used solutions in the USA, the University of Wisconsin solution (UW) and Celsior solution (CS), on outcomes after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). We retrospectively reviewed adult OHT recipients in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database. Primary stratification was by preservation solution. The primary end-point was short-term survival (30 days and 1 year). Secondary end-points included common post-operative complications. Subgroup analysis was performed in high-risk allografts (donor age >50 years or ischemic time >4 hours). Risk-adjusted multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression was used to assess survival. From 2004 to 2009, 4,910 patients (3,107 UW and 1,803 CS) with sufficient preservation solution information for analysis underwent OHT. Baseline characteristics were well-matched between the two groups. UW was associated with a small but significantly improved survival compared with CS at 30 days (96.7% vs 95.4%, p = 0.02) and 1 year (89.6% vs 87.0%, p < 0.01).

The Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin is one of the largest transplant centers in Germany with more than 1700 transplant procedures, more than 170 being procedures in children, in patients from the beginning of life to 71 years of age. Survival rates during the early and intermediate follow-up are lower than in international data; however, long-term survival at 15 years or more is similar. Discrepant survival rates derive mainly from the organ shortage that resulted in the development of a different allocation system in Germany as compared to North America and in the increasing number of patients undergoing the bridge-to-transplant concept to move the patient to transplantability. Thus, the patient at highest risk of death while on the waiting list, who according to the ISHLT registry is also the patient at highest risk of death early post-transplant, is the candidate most likely to undergo transplantation in Germany. Unfortunately, the myth persists of solving the donor organ shortage by increasing the \"fairness\" of organ allocation.

A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The issue was to determine the impact of bridge-to-transplant ventricular assist device support on survival after cardiac transplantation. Altogether 428 papers were found using the reported search, of which 12 represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. The treatment options for patients with advanced heart failure or those with deteriorating end-organ function on maximal medical therapy are limited to intravenous inotropes and mechanical assistance with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or ventricular assist device (VAD). Studies exploring the effect of VADs on post-transplant mortality have yielded conflicting results. The Registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation continues to identify mechanical support as a risk factor for decreased survival after transplantation. A limitation of this report is that the multivariable adjustment uses variables recorded not at the time of device implant but at the time of transplant. Some of the recipient characteristics thus may be altered by the device implant. Compared with the previous reports the latest data show improvement in post-transplant survival in the recent era. In addition, the excess risk appears to be limited to the early post-transplant period. Experienced centers consistently report outstanding post-transplant results with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) bridging. Of the 12 papers seven showed no difference in survival, and five showed a reduced survival. In the papers showing no difference, one year survival averaged from 85% in supported patients to 87% in non-supported patients. In papers reporting a difference in outcome, one year averaged survival was 74% in LVAD recipients compared to 90% in non-bridged patients. Decreased survival is associated with patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy, transplanted within two weeks of LVAD implantation and bridged to transplantation before 2003 as opposed to patients transplanted more recently. Based on the available evidence we conclude that in selected patients survival after heart transplantation in patients bridged with VAD is comparable to those who did not receive the device.

Competing risks analysis may inform patient prioritization for transplantation listing. The Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry enrolled 1731 children diagnosed with DCM from 1990 to 2007. Etiologic, demographic, and echocardiographic data collected at diagnosis were analyzed with competing risks methods stratified by DCM etiology to identify predictors of death and transplantation. For idiopathic DCM (n=1192), diagnosis after 6 years of age, congestive heart failure, and lower left ventricular (LV) fractional shortening z score were independently associated with both death and transplantation equally. In contrast, increased LV end-diastolic dimension z score was associated only with transplantation, whereas lower height-for-age z score was associated only with death. For neuromuscular disease (n=139), lower LV fractional shortening was associated equally with both end points, but increased LV end-diastolic dimension was associated only with transplantation. The risks of death and transplantation were increased equally for older age at diagnosis, congestive heart failure, and increased LV end-diastolic dimension among those with myocarditis (n=272) and for congestive heart failure and decreased LV fractional shortening among those with familial DCM (n=79). Risk factors for death and transplantation in children varied by DCM etiology.

Between January 1993 and December 2008, 3,016 patients (>1 month of age) were listed for heart transplantation. PRA data at listing were available for 2,500 (83%) patients, and 2,237 underwent transplantation with PRA data being available for 1,904 (85%). Because various PRA assays were employed (e.g., cell-based and solid phase) we entered the highest value regardless of methodology. Among the factors associated with high PRA at transplant were Status 1 at listing, previous sternotomy and prior Norwood procedure. An elevated PRA at listing was associated with higher risk of death while waiting. Of subjects with PRA \u2265 50% only 57% were transplanted by 1 year on the waitlist, as compared with 76% of those with PRA <10%. Waitlist mortality for the highly allosensitized subjects (\u2265 PRA 50%) was 19% by 12 months.

Those with elevated PRA who had a negative prospective crossmatch had no difference in survival compared with those without allosensitization. There was no significant association between PRA levels and time to first rejection or development of coronary allograft vasculopathy. Significant allosensitization is associated with more than a 2-fold increased risk of death within the first transplant year.

Although panel reactive antibody activity did not affect rejection in the year after orthotopic heart transplantation for either device type, high panel reactive antibody class II was associated with higher rates of primary graft dysfunction for both devices (P < .05). This is the largest modern study to examine the impact of detailed panel reactive antibody information in patients bridged to transplant. High panel reactive antibody levels do not affect drug-treated rejection episodes in the first year post-orthotopic heart transplantation; however, there is an associated higher rate of primary graft dysfunction, regardless of device type. Highly sensitized patients bridged to transplant experience excellent survival outcomes after orthotopic heart transplantation.

We sought to determine outcomes in patients with and without symptomatic cerebrovascular disease (sCVD) undergoing heart transplantation. Second, we sought to determine factors associated with stroke in the perioperative period after heart transplantation. sCVD is considered a relative contraindication to heart transplantation. Despite this concern, outcomes in patients with sCVD undergoing heart transplantation have not been well defined. Data on all single-organ heart transplants performed in the United States between April 1994 and December 2006 in patients age 40 years or older were analyzed. Survival analysis was performed to examine the effect of sCVD on the combined outcome of stroke or death, stroke, death, and functional decline, adjusting for potential confounding variables over long-term follow-up. In a separate analysis, predictors of perioperative stroke during the transplant-related hospitalization were examined using multiple logistic regression. There were 1,078 patients with and 16,765 patients without sCVD. The annualized rates of stroke or death (11.5% vs. 7.8%; p < 0.001), stroke (4% vs. 1.4%; p < 0.001), death (8.9% vs. 7.4%; p < 0.001), and functional decline (3.7% vs. 3.0%; p = 0.002) were higher in patients with sCVD than in patients without sCVD. In multivariable analysis, patients with sCVD were at increased risk of stroke or death (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17 to 1.42), stroke (HR: 2.24; 95% CI: 2.02 to 2.87), and functional decline (HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.42) compared with those without sCVD. We did not identify a higher risk of death in patients with sCVD (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.20), compared with those without sCVD. sCVD, ventilator use, and ventricular assist device use were the most important predictors of perioperative stroke. Patients with sCVD are at an increased risk of stroke and functional decline after transplantation independent of other variables, but not death, during long-term follow-up. These results should assist programs in making informed decisions in patients with sCVD who are undergoing evaluation for heart transplantation.

No recipient risk index exists predicting short-term mortality after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). We utilized United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data to develop a novel quantitative recipient risk score for use in OHT. A prospectively collected open cohort of 21,378 primary OHT patients (1997 to 2008) was randomly divided into subgroups. The training cohort (n=17,079) was used for score derivation and the test cohort (n=4,299) was used for independent validation. Recipient specific variables associated with 1-year mortality (exploratory p value<0.2) were incorporated stepwise into a multivariable logistic regression model. The final model contained variables which maximized explanatory power (assessed by pseudo R2, area under the curve, and likelihood-ratio test). A risk index was created by apportioning points approximating the relative impact of variables on 1-year mortality. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess impact of risk score on short-term survival. The 50-point scoring system incorporated 12 recipient specific variables. Derivation and validation cohort scores ranged from 0 to 33 and 0 to 27, respectively (mean 6.1\u00b13.7 and 6.1\u00b13.7). Each point increased the odds of 1-year death by 14% in the derivation cohort (odds ratio 1.14 [1.13 to 1.15], p<0.001) and 15% in the validation cohort (odds ratio 1.15 [1.12 to 1.17], p<0001). One-year survivals in the validation cohort (by increments of 3 points) were the following: 0 to 2 (92.5%); 3 to 5 (89.9%); 7 to 9 (86.3%); and 10 or greater (74.9%); p<0.001. Patients transplanted with risk scores of 20 or higher had 1-year mortality rates greater than 50%. We present a novel internally validated OHT recipient risk score, which is highly predictive of 1-year mortality.

The purpose of this study was to determine if orthotopic heart transplantation performed within 90 days of an initial heart transplant (re-Tx) should be a contraindication to retransplantation based on inferior outcomes when compared with primary orthotopic heart transplantation recipients (control). De-identified data were obtained from the United Network for Organ Sharing. The study population included all adult heart transplant recipients greater than 18 years old from 1995 to 2008 (n=26,804). Multivariable regression was performed in order to assess the simultaneous effect of multiple risk factors on posttransplant graft failure (PTGF) at 90 days. Secondary outcomes of interest included infection, stroke, and dialysis during the transplant hospitalization as well as primary nonfunction of the graft at 90 days. Among the study cohort, there were 90 (0.34%) re-Tx patients. Median survival in this group was 1.6 years compared with 10.5 years for controls. Unadjusted PTGF, infection, dialysis, and primary nonfunction were significantly higher (p<0.001) in the re-Tx group. After risk adjustment, however, PTGF (p=0.545), infection (p=0.696), dialysis (p=0.664), stroke (p=0.115), and primary nonfunction (p=0.531), did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. When controlling for pretransplant recipient characteristics, retransplantation within 90 days of a previous transplant is not associated with increased morbidity or mortality. However, unadjusted overall survival was significantly worse in the re-Tx group. This suggests that although retransplantation at 90 days alone is not a risk factor for inferior outcomes, given the significant comorbidities of these patients, the indications for retransplantation within 90 days are rare and must be critically examined.

Seventeen patients (1.3%) were supported with ECMO before lung transplant. Diagnoses included retransplantation (n = 6), pulmonary fibrosis (n = 6), cystic fibrosis (n = 4), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 1). Fifteen patients underwent double lung transplant, one patient had single left lung transplant and one patient had a heart-lung transplant. Venovenous and venoarterial ECMO were implanted in eight and nine cases, respectively. Median duration of support was 3.2 days (range, 1 to 49 days). Mean patient follow-up was 2.3 years.

Fifteen (41%) patients were considered transplant eligible (bridge to transplant, BTT group) at the time of device insertion and received a HeartMate XVE (n = 7), HeartMate 2 (n = 7), or a Novacor LVAS (n = 1). In the BTC group, patients received the HeartMate XVE device (n = 11), HeartMate 2 (n = 5), or the Novacor LVAS (n = 6).

Overall wait-list mortality declined in successive eras (26%, 23%, 18% and 13%, respectively). The decline across eras remained significant in adjusted analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 0.70 in successive eras, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67-0.74) and was 67% lower for children listed during 2005-2009 versus those listed during 1989-1994 (HR 0.33; CI, 0.28-0.39). In models stratified by race, wait-list mortality decreased in all racial groups in successive eras. In models stratified by era, minority children were not at higher risk of wait-list mortality in the most recent era.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term risks and efficacy of TLI in the treatment of rejection. Between 1990 and 1996, 73 adult patients (from 211 adult transplant recipients) received TLI for recurrent rejection (71%), rejection with hemodynamic compromise (25%), and rejection with vasculitis (4%). The treatment consisted of 80 cGy twice per week for 5 weeks. Fifty-five patients received at least 80% of the full dose (>640 cGy). Follow-up ended December 31, 2007, comprising a total 18 year experience. Patients treated with TLI exhibited a short-term decrease in hazard for rejection in the first 12 months posttransplantation (relative risk, 0.36) but exhibited increased cumulative rejection over the long term. There were no differences in the rates of infection, allograft coronary disease, or malignancy, but seven patients developed myelodysplasia or acute myelogenous leukemia, four of those being the rare but uniformly fatal acute megakaryocytic leukemia type 7. Patients treated with TLI seemed to experience a reduction in the early hazard for rejection, but long-term outcomes indicate that such patients continued to accumulate more rejection and rejection-death events, likely because these patients were overall at much higher risk for rejection than the other patient groups.

No standard index based on donor factors exists for predicting mortality after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). We utilized United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data to develop a quantitative donor risk score for OHT. We examined a prospectively collected open cohort of 22,252 patients who underwent primary OHT (1996 to 2007). Of the 284 donor-specific variables, those associated with 1-year (year) mortality (exploratory p-value < 0.2) were incorporated into a multivariate (MV) logistic regression model. The final model contained donor factors that improved the explanatory power (by pseudo-R2, area under the curve and likelihood ratio test). A quantitative donor risk score was created using odds ratios (ORs) from the final model. For external validity, a cross-validation strategy was employed whereby the score was generated using a randomly generated subset of cases (n = 17,788) and then independently validated on the remaining patients (n = 4,464). A 15-point scoring system incorporated 4 variables: ischemic time; donor age; race mismatching; and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine ratio. Derivation and validation cohort scores ranged from 1 to 15 and 1 to 12, respectively (mean 4.0 \u00b1 2.1 for each).

Graft function, rejection periods, and patient survival were analyzed. Renal allograft rejection was noted in three patients (23%) after HKTx and in four patients (31%) after KTx. Serum creatinine levels were comparable at 1 week, 1 month, 1, 2, and 3 years after transplantation. Patient survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 100% for HKTx recipients and 100, 92, and 92% for isolated KTx patients. Graft survival was 92% at 1, 2, and 3 years after HKTx and 100% at 1 year and 92% at 2 and 3 years after isolated KTx. Our results with excellent long-term graft function and survival after combined HKTx indicate that this procedure is a valuable option for a growing number of patients suffering from coexistent cardiac and renal failure.

Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is an important problem after heart transplantation. Most cases seem to occur in sensitized recipients with preformed donor-specific human leukocyte antigen antibody (DSA) early after transplantation. Few data exist on AMR in patients who form de novo DSA. We describe the clinical features and treatment outcome for late AMR secondary to de novo DSA. This was a retrospective, observational cohort study. All heart transplant patients treated for symptomatic AMR secondary to de novo DSA between November 2005 and August 2011. Fifteen patients were treated for AMR giving an incidence of 3.1 cases per 1000 person years and a prevalence of 1.4%. All had evidence of heart failure on presentation and de novo DSA at diagnosis. There was a spectrum of histologic and immunohistochemical findings. Despite treatment with immunepheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab, and in some cases total lymph node irradiation (n=3) and bortezomib (n=2), clinical outcomes were poor. DSA antibody levels, measured using Labscreen single antigen kits, were reduced by a mean of 76% with a median of 77% and a range of 35% to 99%, but were not eliminated. Forty-six percent had persistent cardiac allograft dysfunction. Mean and median survival was 1.3 and 0.8 years after diagnosis of AMR. Only 40% were alive at the end of the study period. Late cardiac AMR caused by de novo DSA was an uncommon but serious problem. Despite treatment consistent with current best practice, 46% of patients developed persistent cardiac dysfunction and their medium-term survival was poor.

The risk of death on the wait list or becoming too sick to transplant has decreased by 17% in the US since the allocation algorithm allowing broader regional sharing was implemented in 2006.

The aim of the present study was to identify the predictors of 5-year survival in elderly patients undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). A review of the United Network for Organ Sharing database was conducted of recipients 60 years old or older undergoing OHT from 1995 to 2004. The variables were compared between the 5-year survivors and the patients who died within 5 years of OHT. A multivariate logistic regression model was constructed using the covariates significantly associated with 5-year survival on univariate analysis. A total of 5330 elderly patients underwent OHT during the study period. Of these patients, 3492 (65.5%) were 5-year survivors, 1580 (29.6%) had died within 5 years of OHT and were considered controls, and 258 (4.8%) were lost to follow-up. The predictors of improved 5-year survival included younger age (odds ratio [OR], 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-1.00; P = .03), lower creatinine (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.98; P = .01), white race (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02-1.49; P = .03), shorter ischemic time (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-0.99; P = .02), and younger donor age (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.99-1.00; P = .03).

Ventricular assist device data were only available for 2538 patients (49.6%). When added to the multivariate model, the use of a ventricular assist device significantly reduced the odds of surviving 5 years after OHT (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.50-0.81; P < .001). In the present study of more than 5000 elderly OHT patients, younger recipient age, white race, lower creatinine, younger donor age, and shorter ischemic time were associated with improved 5-year survival. In contrast, bridging with a ventricular assist device, mechanical ventilation, hypertension, and diabetes significantly decreased the odds of 5-year survival.

Deciding to use an organ from a donor with a primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor necessitates offsetting the risk of tumor transmission with the chances of survival if the patient waits for another offer of a transplant. Published data vary in the quoted risk of tumor transmission. We used data obtained by reviewing 246 UK recipients of organs taken from donors with CNS tumors and found no evidence of a difference in overall patient mortality for recipients of a kidney, liver, or cardiothoracic organ, compared with recipients of organs from donors without a CNS tumor. Recent publication of the UK experience of transplanting organs from CNS tumor donors found no transmission in 448 recipients of organs from 177 donors with a primary CNS tumor (Watson et al., Am J Transplant 2010; 10: 1437). This 0% transmission rate is associated with an upper 95% confidence interval limit of 1.5%. Using a series of assumptions of risk, we compared the risks of dying as a result of the transmission of a primary brain tumor with the risks of dying if not transplanted. On this basis, the use of kidneys from a donor with a primary CNS tumor provides a further 8 years of life over someone who waited for a donor who did not have a primary CNS tumor, in addition to the life years gained by the transplant itself. The benefits for the recipients of livers and cardiothoracic organs were less, but there was no disadvantage in the impact on life expectancy.

Based on the results of clinical trials, the prognosis for patients with severe heart failure (HF) has improved over the last 20 years. However, clinical trials do not reflect 'real life' due to patient selection. Thus, the aim of the POLKARD-HF registry was the analysis of survival of patients with refractory HF referred for orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). Between 1 November 2003 and 31 October 2007, 983 patients with severe HF, referred for OHT in Poland, were included into the registry. All patients underwent routine clinical and hemodynamic evaluation, with NT-proBNP and hsCRP assessment. Death or an emergency OHT were assumed as the endpoints. The average observation period was 601 days. Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank and univariate together with multifactor Cox regression model the stepwise variable selection method were used to determine the predictive value of analyzed variables. Among the 983 patients, the probability of surviving for one year was approximately 80%, for two years 70%, and for three years 67%. Etiology of the HF did not significantly influence the prognosis. The patients in NYHA class IV had a three-fold higher risk of death or emergency OHT. The univariate/multifactor Cox regression analysis revealed that NYHA IV class (HR 2.578, p < 0.0001), HFSS score (HR 2.572, p < 0.0001) and NT-proBNP plasma level (HR 1.600, p = 0.0200), proved to influence survival without death or emergency OHT. Despite optimal treatment, the prognosis for patients with refractory HF is still not good. NYHA class IV, NT-proBNP and HFSS score can help define the highest risk group.

Children <18 years of age who underwent primary HT in the United States during 1999-2008 (n = 2707) were identified using Organ Procurement and Transplant Network data. A risk-prediction model was developed using two-thirds of the cohort (random sample), internally validated in the remaining one-third, and independently validated in a cohort of 338 children transplanted during 2009-2010. The best predictive model had four categorical variables: hemodynamic support (ECMO, ventilator support, VAD support vs. medical therapy), cardiac diagnosis (repaired congenital heart disease [CHD], unrepaired CHD vs. cardiomyopathy), renal dysfunction (severe, mild-moderate vs. normal) and total bilirubin (\u2265 2.0, 0.6 to <2.0 vs. <0.6 mg/dL).

The impact of metabolic risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity) on mortality post-OHT was evaluated in a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis adjusted for other variables associated with survival in univariate analysis (exploratory p value<0.2). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were compared with the log-rank test. A total of 15,960 eligible patients underwent OHT during the study period. There were 6,368 (39.9%) patients with none of these risk factors, 6,138 (38.5%) with 1 risk factor, 2,811 (17.6%) with 2 risk factors, and 643 (4.0%) who had all 3 risk factors. After adjusting for other significant variables influencing survival, each individual risk factor independently increased the likelihood of mortality post-OHT (hypertension: HR 1.10 [1.03 to 1.17]; diabetes: HR 1.22[1.13 to 1.31]; obesity: HR 1.17 [1.10 to 1.26], each p<0.01).

ABO incompatible (ABOi) heart transplantation is an accepted approach to increasing organ availability for young patients. Previous studies have suggested that early survival for ABOi transplants is similar to ABO compatible (ABOc) transplants. We analyzed the Pediatric Heart Transplant Study (PHTS) database from 1/96 to 12/08 to further assess this strategy. We analyzed the numbers of ABOi and ABOc done at the PHTS centers. We then compared the clinical characteristics, and short-term freedom from death, rejection and infection in the ABOi patients with the patients that had an ABOc heart transplant during the same period. All patients were less than or equal to 15 months of age at listing (the age of the oldest ABOi patient). We adjusted for co-variates shown to increase risk for mortality (age less than 1 month, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), ventilator, previous sternotomy, and congenital heart disease). There were 931 total transplants done at 34 PHTS centers during the 12 year time period in patients \u226415 months of age. Of these, 502 transplants were performed at 20 PHTS centers that did at least one ABOi heart transplant. Eighty-five of the 502 (17%) were ABOi. At time of transplant, ABOi recipients compared with ABOc were more likely to be on a ventilator (49.4% vs 36.5%, p=0.025), and more often supported with ECMO (23.5% vs 13.4%, p=0.018). There was similar survival at 12 months (82% vs 84%, p=0.7). In risk adjusted analysis ABOi status was not associated with 1 year mortality (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.45-1.6, p=0.61). The ABOi patients had greater freedom from rejection when compared with ABOc patients for all 34 centers (75% vs 62%, p=0.016), but the difference was not significant when limited only to the 20 centers doing ABOi transplants (75% vs 69%, p=0.4).

Thirty-three donors (92%) required catecholamine at an average of 8.0 \u00b1 5.2 \u00b5g/hg/min and echocardiogram findings showed that left ventricular ejection fraction was 65 \u00b1 10%. All recipients survived during the perioperative period (one patient died from sepsis at 4 years after transplantation) for a 10-year survival rate of 95%. Severe primary graft dysfunction was observed in two patients who required intra-aortic balloon pumping or veno-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation, and five other patients showed postoperative LOS (cardiac index < 2.2 l/min/m(2)).

A HeartMate II was used to bridge 1,312 patients (average age, 52\u00b112 years) to OHT, most commonly for idiopathic cardiomyopathy (50.7%). During the study, 171 patients (13.0%) died. The unadjusted 90-day survival was 92.3%. The highest annual average center volume in this cohort, examining for BTT recipients only, was 28 BTT procedures yearly. Postoperative cerebrovascular accident occurred in 29 patients (2.2%), and 106 (8.3%) required renal replacement therapy. Cox regression revealed age, glomerular filtration rate, African American race, human leukocyte antigen mismatch, serum bilirubin, need for mechanical ventilation, donor age, and prolonged ischemia time were associated with 90-day death. Early survival was improved for patients who underwent OHT at high-volume centers (p=0.01).

Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) may be required after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHTx) in children for the treatment of failure or rejection. We review the incidence and outcomes of post-transplant MCS in our institution. MCS was classified as early (<1 month since transplant) or late (>1 month since transplant) and the support offered was either veno-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) or a ventricular assist device (VAD). From 2003 to the present, 100 children (<16 years) underwent OHTx. Fifteen (15%) had 17 episodes of MCS. MCS was instituted early in 10 and late in seven episodes. Two children required two episodes of support. VA-ECMO was used in 12 episodes (71%). Two children required VAD support alone (12%). In three (17%) episodes ECMO was subsequently converted from VAD. Among 10 children with early failure, eight were successfully weaned from support with recovery of graft function. In the late failure group, three of six patients died. All but four patients underwent re-transplantation with no perioperative deaths. Overall survival to discharge was 66%. The early failure group shows a better survival rate to hospital discharge compared with the late failure group (78 vs 50%; P < 0.0001). The incidence of post-transplant MCS for graft failure in our patients was 15%. Early graft failure has a better outcome than late failure. Re-transplantation has good mid-term outcomes in children.

The prevalence of heart failure (HF) is rising and the only corrective treatment is cardiac transplantation. Advanced HF is associated with congestive hepatopathy and progressive functional and ultrastructural changes of the liver. We hypothesized that hepatic dysfunction is associated with impaired clinical outcome after heart transplantation. Data of 617 adult patients (75% men, mean age 53 \u00b1 12 years, mean BMI 25 \u00b1 4, mean ejection fraction 19 \u00b1 9%) undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) were analyzed retrospectively. Deviation from institutional normal ranges was used to define abnormal liver function. Standard Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores were calculated and a modified MELD score with albumin replacing INR (modMELD) was created to eliminate the confounding effects of anti-coagulation. Before OHT, AST, ALT and total bilirubin were elevated in 20%, 18% and 29% of the population, respectively. Total protein and albumin were decreased in 25% and 52% of the population, respectively. By 2 months post-transplantation, percentages of individuals with pathologic values decreased significantly, except for ALT, total protein and albumin, all of which took longer to normalize. Individuals with a higher pre-transplantation MELD or modMELD score had worse outcome 30 days post-transplant and reduced long-term survival over a 10-year follow-up. In this large, single-center retrospective study, we demonstrated the dynamics of liver dysfunction after cardiac transplantation and that elevated MELD scores indicating impaired liver function are associated with poor clinical outcome after OHT. Thus, pre-operative liver dysfunction has a significant impact on survival of patients after cardiac transplantation.

Early graft failure (EGF) is a dreaded complication after heart transplantation (HT). Despite several improvements, no effective therapy has been developed and the prognosis is poor. We evaluated the risk factors and clinical impact of EGF. In a consecutive series of 317 HTs performed at a single institution between January 1999 and December 2008, variables associated significantly with EGF were sought in bivariate and multivariable discriminant analyses. The deriving propensity score was used to stratify the study sample in to three groups (low, intermediate and high risk for EGF). Comparisons were performed between the higher-risk group and the remaining population in terms of preoperative features and outcomes. EGF occurred in 10.1% of the overall population (2.9, 3.8 and 23.6%, respectively, in the three groups). Overall, EGF-related mortality was 56.3% (100, 75 and 48%, respectively, in the three groups). Determinants of EGF in the highest-risk group were: redo procedure, valvular cardiomyopathy, status one at transplant, recipient male sex, donor-recipient (D/R) weight mismatch, high inotropic donor support, ischaemic time and first day troponin I release. In conclusion, several donor and recipient features predicted EGF.

Despite the excellent outcomes in the current era after the Fontan procedure, it continues to have an inherent risk of failure. Cardiac transplantation provides 1 option for treating these patients; however, the indications for, timing of, and outcomes after, transplantation remain undefined. We examined our own institutional experience with transplantation for failed Fontan. The records of 155 patients transplanted for congenital heart disease at a single institution from June 1984 to September 2007 were reviewed. Of these patients, 43 had undergone a previous Fontan procedure (25 male, 15 female; median age, 14.5 years; range, 1-47; 23 classic Fontan, 13 lateral tunnel, 4 extracardiac conduit, and 3 revised to shunt). The predictors of short- and long-term survival were evaluated, and the Fontan patients were compared with all other patients with congenital heart disease (n = 129, 78 male, 51 female). The most common indications for transplantation included protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) (39.5%), chronic heart failure (41.8%), and acute post-Fontan failure (9.3%). The transplants performed in Fontan patients were more likely to require pulmonary artery reconstruction (85.4% vs 42.9%; P < .0001) and had longer cardiopulmonary bypass times (278 vs 179 minutes; P < .0001). The 90-day mortality rate was greater in the Fontan group (35.0% vs 20.0%; P = .055). No correlation was observed between the interval from Fontan to transplantation and morality; however, renal failure was a strong predictor of early mortality (odds ratio, 10.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-75.7).

Factors influencing time to CKD, defined as National Kidney Foundation CKD stage 4 or 5 or preemptive kidney transplantation, were identified using a Cox proportional hazards model. The effects of distinct CKD stages on survival were evaluated using time-dependent covariates. A total of 3% of patients had CKD at transplantation, 11% at 1-year and more than 15% at 6 years posttransplantation and beyond. Earlier transplantations, shorter ischemia times, female, older, hepatitis C virus positive, and diabetic recipients were at increased risk of developing CKD, along with those with impaired renal function pretransplantation or early posttransplantation. Significant differences between transplantation centers were also observed. The risk of death was significantly higher for patients at CKD stage 4, stage 5 (excluding dialysis), or on dialysis, compared with equivalent patients surviving to the same time point with CKD stage 3 or lower (hazard ratios of 1.66, 8.54, and 4.07, respectively).

This allowance may create competition for organs between stable LVAD-supported registrants and less stable registrants listed status 1A or 1B. The Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database was analyzed for all status 1A and 1B listings between 2005 and 2010. Cox models were used to estimate the relative and absolute risk of adverse events (death or delisting as too ill) during status 1A or 1B listing. Status 1A registrants supported with dual inotropes and right heart monitoring had a higher risk of adverse events compared to those supported with implanted LVADs using elective 1A time (hazard ratio: 3.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.8 to 5.7).

Parallel advancements in surgical technique, preoperative and postoperative care, as well as a better understanding of physiology in patients with duct-dependent pulmonary or systemic circulation and a functional single ventricle, have led to superb results in staged palliation of most complex congenital heart disease (CHD) [1]. The Fontan procedure and its technical modifications have resulted in markedly improved outcomes of patients with single ventricle anatomy [2,3,4]. The improved early survival has led to an exponential increase of the proportion of Fontan patients surviving long into adolescence and young adulthood [5]. Improved early and late survival has not yet abolished late mortality secondary to myocardial failure, therefore increasing the referrals for cardiac transplantation [6]. Interstage attrition [7] is moreover expected in staged palliation towards completion of a Fontan-type circulation, while Fontan failure represents a growing indication for heart transplantation [8].

Heart transplantation is an accepted therapeutic modality for end-stage congenital heart disease for both biventricular and univentricular anomalies. Many transplant centers have pushed the limits of transplantation to include patients with high pulmonary vascular resistance, high panel reactive antibodies, positive cross-matches, and ABO-incompatibility. Excellent results have been possible, particularly with the development of improved diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms to prevent and treat rejection, infection, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. Late graft failure and chronic rejection remain vexing problems. The vast majority of patients with biventricular congenital heart disease have undergone prior cardiac surgical procedures. Indications for transplantation in this subgroup are primarily progressive refractory heart failure following prior cardiac surgical reconstructive procedures. Contraindications to transplantation mimic those for other forms of end-stage heart disease. A determination of pulmonary vascular resistance is important in listing patients with biventricular congenital heart disease for heart transplantation. Modifications in the implant technique are necessary and vary depending on underlying recipient anatomy. Risk factors for perioperative outcomes in patients with biventricular congenital heart disease include the need for reoperation, the degree of anatomic reconstruction necessary during the implant procedure, and the degree of antibody sensitization, in addition to a number of other recipient and donor factors. Postoperative outcomes and survival are very good but remain inferior to those with cardiomyopathy in most series.

Existing censoring unbiased transformations generally depend on either the conditional survival function of the response of interest, or that of the censoring variable. We show that a mapping introduced in another statistical context is in fact a censoring unbiased transformation with a beneficial double robustness property, in that it can be used for nonparametric regression if either of these two conditional distributions are estimated accurately.

To establish quicker cardiac arrest and less myocardial distension injury during heart procurement, we combined St. Thomas and histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solutions for donor heart preservation since June 2008. From June 2008 to March 2010, we enrolled 31 heart transplantation (HT) patients in this study. During heart procurement we initially infused 1,000 mL cold St Thomas cardioplegic solution to achieve cardiac arrest. After procurement, a further 2,000 mL of cold HTK solution was infused at low perfusion pressure. Another 1,000 mL cold HTK solution was perfused before donor heart implantation. We examined donor age, recipient preoperative characteristics, ischemia time, hospital stay, postoperative graft function, major cardiac events, and transplant vasculopathy (TCAD). Twenty-two patients (71.0%) presented with dilated cardiomyopathy and 7 (23.3%) with ischemia cardiomyopathy. There were 23 (76.7%) male donors, and the mean donor age was 38.4 \u00b1 13.8 years. Six patients underwent a redo sternotomy, 1 patient needed a third-do sternotomy, and 1 a seventh sternotomy (third HT) for repeated endocarditis and graft failure. The average ischemia time was 224.9 \u00b1 71.0 minutes and the postoperative hospital stay was 57.7 \u00b1 47.7 days. The surgical mortality (3.2%) was not accompanied by hospital or follow-up mortality. Patient left ventricular ejection fraction postoperative was 59.6 \u00b1 2.3% with good functional status.

Clinical outcomes of heart transplantation (HTx) among recipients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are poorly understood especially in Asia. Therefore, this study evaluated these clinical outcomes. Using retrospective chart review we collected data on 385 patients including 20 HCV-positive recipients at the time of transplantation. We obtained information on demographics features, serial transaminases, graft function, patient survival as well as the incidences of acute hepatitis and transplant coronary artery disease. Between 1987 and 2010, the 20 HCV-positive patients had a median age at transplantation of 52 years (range, 30-63). Seventeen were men and three women. All the patients were classified as Child-Pugh class A; two had cirrhosis prior to HTx. Over a mean follow-up of 63 months (range, 2 days to 187 months), there were 11 deaths, including two hospital mortalities and nine subsequent deaths. Only one mortality (5%) was related to Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis, despite liver transplantation.

Due to its invasiveness, discomfort, and difficult vascular access, some patients are not willing to accept routine scheduled biopsies years after heart transplantation. The purpose of this study was to identify whether there was a difference in outcomes among the scheduled versus event biopsy groups. We studied 411 patients who underwent heart transplantation from 1987 to 2011, reviewing biopsy results and pathology reports. There were 363 patients who followed the scheduled biopsy protocol, and 48 patients who were assigned to the event biopsy group. We extracted data on biopsy results, rejection episodes, rejection types, and survival time. The 2481 reviewed biopsies over 24 years, showed most rejection episodes (86.4%) to occur within 2 years after heart transplantation. The rejection incidence was low (2.1%) at 3 years after transplantation. The major reason for an event biopsy was poor vascular access, such as tiny central vein or congenital disease without a suitable central vein. Event biopsy group patients were younger than schedule biopsy patients (19.7 years old vs 47.6 years old; P < .05). The 10-year survival rates were 64% among the event versus 53% among the scheduled biopsy group (P = .029). The 10-year rates of freedom from rejection were similar. The rejection rate was low after 3 years; episodes occurred within 2 years. Although the long-term survival in the event group was better, they had a younger man age.

We conducted a retrospective review of 83 pediatric patients with dilated cardiomyopathy whose initial hospitalization fell between 2004 and 2009. The mean age at hospitalization was 7 years. The majority of patients demonstrated moderate or severe left ventricular dysfunction on initial echocardiogram (80%) and/or the need for intravenous inotropes within 7 days of hospital admission (69%).

The overall freedom from death, transplantation, or rehospitalization at 1 year following admission was 21%. Fractional shortening, left ventricular ejection fraction, serum cholesterol, uric acid, mixed venous saturation, and atrial filling pressures were all predictive of death or transplantation during the initial hospitalization. Left ventricular ejection fraction was predictive of death or transplantation at 1 year.

Therefore, the purposes of our retrospective analyses of a prospective, longitudinal study were to examine (1) the relationship between satisfaction with social support and post-HT health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and survival and (2) whether 2 types of social support (emotional and tangible) were predictors of survival and HRQOL. Data were collected from 555 HT patients over a 5-year period (78% male, 88% white; mean age, 53.8 years at time of transplantation) at 4 US medical centers using the following instruments: Social Support Index, Quality of Life Index, Heart Transplant Stressor Scale, Jalowiec Coping Scale, and medical records review.

Little is known about the CD98 heavy chain (CD98hc) in the T lymphocyte-mediated immune response to alloantigen. We used an in vitro mixed leukocyte reaction assay and a cardiac transplantation model to evaluate the mechanisms of CD98hc in regulating alloimmune responses. A T cell-specific deficiency of CD98hc resulted in lower responses to alloantigen stimulation in a mixed leukocyte reaction assay, and CD98hc-deficient mice accepted full major histocompatibility complex-mismatched cardiac allografts. Consistent with graft survival, the infiltration of the graft by immune cells in CD98hc-deficient mice was significantly lower than that in wild-type mice. A chemotaxis assay revealed the migration of CD98hc-deficient lymphocytes to decrease in the presence of CCL5 compared with wild-type cells. Moreover, the proportion of CD4/Foxp3-positive cells and Foxp3 messenger RNA increased significantly in CD98hc-deficient recipients, consistent with the down-regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin and PS6 kinase; and allograft permanent acceptance was shortened by the depletion of antibody-induced regulatory T cells. Finally, neutralizing antibody against CD98hc prolonged the cardiac allograft survival. Taken together, our data indicate that T cell-specific deficiency in CD98hc can contribute to cardiac allograft permanent acceptance correlating with the attenuation of lymphocyte migration and by increasing the generation of regulatory T cells.

Successful heart transplantation was performed in a total of seven patients without mortality, re-exploration or blood transfusion. One patient had left ventricular reduction surgery twice and another patient had bypass surgery several years after transplantation. Other successful organ transplantations were also reported, including lung, liver, kidney and pancreas in both adult and paediatric patients of the JW faith, with comparable mortality and morbidity to non-JW patients. A publication bias is likely; nevertheless, we conclude that although there are no large studies directly focused on heart transplantation in JW patients, a multidisciplinary team approach to such surgery can make it technically feasible and without an increased mortality risk in suitable candidates. Therefore, such patients may be considered for heart transplantation under selected and favourable circumstances.

Only those who underwent primary orthotopic heart transplants were selected, excluding those with multi-organ transplants. Infant mortality in the first three months after heart transplantation should be given more attention because strategies to prevent early graft failure would have the greatest impact on survival in this group. African American recipients are the group most vulnerable to graft loss in solid organ transplantation, with no exception for heart transplant.

Over three decades of experience in the selection of donors and recipients has permitted us to expand eligibility limits and relax conventional exclusion criteria, allowing us to transplant high-risk donors and medically complex recipients with excellent results. Increasing use of mechanical support is being seen to bridge candidates to cardiac transplantation. Recipient characteristics, rather than those of the donor, substantially impact outcome following OHT and use of extended-criteria donors helps to alleviate the ongoing donor shortage; but this scarcity of donor hearts remains the major obstacle to the growth of transplantation. During the last decade, substantial improvements have been made in the areas of immunosuppression, treatment of rejection, and handling of sensitized recipients. Frequent causes of late mortality such as graft rejection, infection and TCAD, have been significantly diminished in the modern area of immune manipulation but remain major causes of death and barriers to long-term survival.

Although newer immunosuppressive agents, such as mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors, have lowered the occurrence of malignancies after transplantation, cancer is still a leading cause of death late after heart transplantation. Statins may have an impact on clinical outcomes beyond their lipid-lowering effects. The aim of the present study was to delineate whether statin therapy has an impact on cancer risk and total mortality after heart transplantation. A total of 255 patients who underwent heart transplantation at the University Hospital Zurich between 1985 and 2007 and survived the first year were included in the present study. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of any malignancy; the secondary end point was overall survival. During follow-up, a malignancy was diagnosed in 108 patients (42%). The cumulative incidence of tumors 8 years after transplantation was reduced in patients receiving a statin (34% versus 13%; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.43 versus 0.07-0.18; P<0.003). Statin use was associated with improved cancer-free and overall survival (both P<0.0001). A Cox regression model that analyzed the time to tumor formation with or without statin therapy, adjusted for age, male sex, type of cardiomyopathy, and immunosuppressive therapy (including switch to mTOR inhibitors or tacrolimus), demonstrated a superior survival in the statin group. Statins reduced the hazard of occurrence of any malignancy by 67% (hazard ratio, 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.51; P<0.0001). Although it is not possible to adjust for all potential confounders because of the very long follow-up period, this registry suggests that statin use is associated with improved cancer-free and overall survival after cardiac transplantation.

Average 2-year survival after cardiac transplantation is approximately 80%. The evolution and subsequent approval of larger pulsatile and, more recently, continuous flow mechanical circulatory support (MCS) technology for destination therapy (DT) offers the potential for triage of some patients awaiting cardiac transplantation to DT. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) is a national multi-institutional study of long-term MCS. Between June 2006 and December 2011, 127 pulsatile and 1160 continuous flow pumps (24% of total primary left ventricular assist devices [LVADs]) carried an initial strategy of DT therapy. By multivariable analysis, risk factors (P < .05) for mortality after DT included older age, larger body mass index, history of cancer, history of cardiac surgery, INTERMACS level I (cardiogenic shock), dialysis, increased blood urea nitrogen, use of a pulsatile flow device, and use of a right ventricular assist device (RVAD). Among patients with a continuous flow LVAD who were not in cardiogenic shock, a particularly favorable survival was associated with no cancer, patients not in cardiogenic shock, and blood urea nitrogen less than 50 mg/dL, resulting in 1- and 2-year survivals of 88% and 80%.

Despite many advances in the management of patients with heart failure, acute cardiogenic shock and progressive congestive heart failure remain serious problems with dismal prognoses. Both temporary and permanent mechanical support has been gaining wide clinical application in this patient population. Although mechanical circulatory support technology is rapidly evolving, this approach is associated with multiple issues such as the optimal duration of temporary support, ideal timing to bridge these patients to a long-term device, and selection of the right device for the right patient. The currently available devices are categorized into two major groups: temporary and long-term devices (including destination therapy). Heart failure is a dynamic condition, and the therapeutic approach may need to be modified depending on the patient's condition. Furthermore, the patient's preexisting morbidity, age, socioeconomic status, and family support are confounding factors that need to be considered when making such decisions.

We analyzed the Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry database (1990-2008; N=3375) for cases of RCM. Cases were defined as pure when RCM was the only assigned diagnosis. Additional documentation of HCM at any time was used as the criterion for RCM/HCM phenotype. RCM accounted for 4.5% of cases of cardiomyopathy. In 101 (66%), pure RCM was diagnosed; in 51 (34%), there was a mixed phenotype. Age at diagnosis was not different between groups, but 10% of the pure RCM group was diagnosed in infancy versus 24% of the RCM/HCM group. Freedom from death was comparable between groups with 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival of RCM 82%, 80%, and 68% versus RCM/HCM 77%, 74%, and 68%.

Polarization of an immune response toward tolerance or immunity is dictated by the interactions between T cells and dendritic cells (DC), which in turn are modulated by the expression of distinct cell surface molecules, and the cytokine milieu in which these interactions are taking place. Genetic modification of DC with genes coding for specific immunoregulatory cell surface molecules and cytokines offers the potential of inhibiting immune responses by selectively targeting Ag-specific T cells. In this study, the immunomodulatory effects of transfecting murine bone marrow-derived DC with Fas ligand (FasL) were investigated. In this study, we show that FasL transfection of DC markedly augmented their capacity to induce apoptosis of Fas+ cells. FasL-transfected DC inhibited allogeneic MLR in vitro, and induced hyporesponsiveness to alloantigen in vivo. The induction of hyporesponsiveness was Ag specific and was dependent on the interaction between FasL on DC and Fas on T cells. Finally, we show that transfusion of FasL-DC significantly prolonged the survival of fully MHC-mismatched vascularized cardiac allografts. Our findings suggest that DC transduced with FasL may facilitate the development of Ag-specific unresponsiveness for the prevention of organ rejection. Moreover, they highlight the potential of genetically engineering DC to express other genes that affect immune responses.

Life-long immunosuppression is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in transplant recipients. Gene therapy could provide new ways to obtain tolerance and avoid indefinite immunosuppression. EpTK mice are derived from the FVB/N strain (H2q) and express the thymidine kinase gene of herpesvirus in all mature T cells. Thus any mature dividing T cell can be killed in the presence of ganciclovir. We investigated the survival of alloincompatible C57B1/6 (H2b) hearts heterotopically transplanted into EpTK mice given only ganciclovir from day 0 to day 7 or 14. Abdominal cardiac transplantations were performed in 22 control mice (untreated FVB [n = 15], ganciclovir-treated FVB [n = 5], and untreated EpTK mice [n = 2]) and in 28 EpTK mice given ganciclovir from day 0 to day 7 (n = 15) or day 14 (n = 13). Rejection was defined as complete cessation of cardiac beat. Histologic examination of the grafts was performed at rejection, at day 7, or at day 100. Lymphocyte proliferation assays (concanavalin A stimulation or mixed lymphocyte reaction) were performed at day 7 and at day 100. All control animals rejected transplants in 7 days (range, 5-9 days), whereas indefinite survival (>100 days) was observed in 89% of the ganciclovir-treated EpTK group, irrespective of the duration of ganciclovir treatment. Graft histology showed extensive cellular infiltrates with myocyte necrosis and arteritis in the control animals but only a mild infiltrate without necrosis or arteritis in the ganciclovir-treated EpTK group. The proliferative responses of the tolerant mice at day 100 were identical to those of naive mice, including a preserved proliferation against the donor's lymphocytes in mixed lymphocyte reaction. Functional transplantation tolerance of a fully incompatible heart can be achieved without immunosuppressive drugs in this model of suicide gene therapy.

Epidemiologic studies have shown an inverse correlation between consumption of fish or other sources of dietary n-3 fatty acids and cardiovascular events. Numerous mechanisms of action for the favorable effect of dietary n-3 fatty acids on factors implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis have been described. Studies in dogs, swine, and nonhuman primates have consistently shown beneficial effects in various models of vasoocclusive diseases. Studies published currently do not indicate that dietary n-3 fatty acids prevent restenosis after percutaneous coronary angioplasty or induce regression of coronary atherosclerosis. However, in a recent study, occlusion of aortocoronary venous bypass grafts was reduced after 1 y by daily ingestion of 4 g fish-oil concentrate. In the Diet and Reinfarction Trial, 2-y overall mortality was reduced by 29% in survivors of a first myocardial infarction after consumption of n-3 fatty acid-rich fatty fish at least twice a week had been advised (Lancet 1989;2:757-61). When n-3 fatty acids were integrated into a diet resembling a traditional Mediterranean diet, 5-y cardiovascular mortality after a first myocardial infarction was reduced by 70% (Lancet 1994; 343:1454-9). Preliminary studies indicate that cardiac transplant patients could be an interesting focus of investigation. Currently, food sources rich in n-3 fatty acids are thought to be beneficial in secondary prophylaxis after a myocardial infarction. Large-scale clinical studies with endpoints such as morbidity and mortality are needed to more precisely define the role of n-3 fatty acids in primary and secondary prophylaxis of coronary atherosclerosis.

Accurately establishing prognosis in severe heart failure has become increasingly important in assessing the efficacy of treatment modalities and in appropriately allocating scarce resources for transplantation. Peak exercise oxygen uptake appears to have an important role in risk stratification of patients with heart failure, but the optimal cutpoint value to separate survivors from nonsurvivors is not clear. Six hundred forty-four patients referred for heart failure evaluation over a 10-year period participated in the study. After pharmacologic stabilization at entrance into the study, all participants underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Survival analysis was performed with death as the end point. Transplantation was considered a censored event. Four-year survival was determined for patients who achieved peak oxygen uptake values greater than and less than 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 mL/kg/min. Follow-up information was complete for 98.3% of the cohort. During a mean follow-up period of 4 years, 187 patients (29%) died and 101 underwent transplantation. Actuarial 1- and 5-year survival rates were 90.5% and 73.4%, respectively. Peak ventilatory oxygen uptake (VO(2)) was an independent predictor of survival and was a stronger predictor than work rate achieved and other exercise and clinical variables. A difference in survival of approximately 20% was achieved by dichotomizing patients above versus below each peak VO(2) value ranging between 10 and 17 mL/kg/min. Survival rate was significantly higher among patients achieving a peak VO (2) above than among those achieving a peak VO (2) below each of these values (P <.01), but each cutpoint was similar in its ability to separate survivors from nonsurvivors. Peak VO (2) is an important measurement in predicting survival from heart failure, but whether an optimal cutpoint exists is not clear. Peak VO(2) may be more appropriately used as a continuous variable in multivariate models to predict prognosis in severe chronic heart failure.

Although mononuclear cell infiltration is a hallmark of cellular rejection of a vascularized allograft, efforts to inhibit rejection by blocking leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion have proved largely unsuccessful, perhaps in part because of persistent generation of chemokines within rejecting grafts. We now provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence that in vivo blockade of specific chemokine receptors is of therapeutic significance in organ transplantation. Inbred mice with a targeted deletion of the chemokine receptor CCR1 showed significant prolongation of allograft survival in 4 models. First, cardiac allografts across a class II mismatch were rejected by CCR1(+/+) recipients but were accepted permanently by CCR1(-/-) recipients. Second, CCR1(-/-) mice rejected completely class I- and class II-mismatched BALB/c cardiac allografts more slowly than control mice. Third, levels of cyclosporin A that had marginal effects in CCR1(+/+) mice resulted in permanent allograft acceptance in CCR1(-/-) recipients. These latter allografts showed no sign of chronic rejection 50-200 days after transplantation, and transfer of CD4(+) splenic T cells from these mice to naive allograft recipients significantly prolonged allograft survival, whereas cells from CCR1(+/+) mice conferred no such benefit. Finally, both CCR1(+/+) and CCR1(-/-) allograft recipients, when treated with a mAb to CD4, showed permanent engraftment, but these allografts showed florid chronic rejection in the former strain and were normal in CCR1(-/-) mice. We conclude that therapies to block CCR1/ligand interactions may prove useful in preventing acute and chronic rejection clinically.

Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors have been shown to reduce NO but yield conflicting results on cardiac allograft survival. In this study, we provide an alternative approach specifically to examine the efficacy of a NO scavenger on nitrosyl complex formation and graft survival in a model of heterotopic cardiac transplantation. Efficacy was examined under both acute and chronic conditions (i.e., without or with immunosuppression, respectively). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of frozen myocardial tissue from untreated allografts showed progressive increases in nitrosylheme and nitrosomyoglobin before graft failure. These signals were not seen in either isografts or native hearts of allograft recipients. Both plasma nitrate plus nitrite and myocardial nitrosyl complex formation in cardiac allografts were significantly decreased in recipient animals treated with the NO scavenger, NOX-100, or by low-dose cyclosporine (CsA). Both interventions were nearly equivalent in significantly prolonging graft survival. The short-term combination treatment of both NOX-100 plus CsA completely eliminated myocardial nitrosyl complex formation and synergistically prolonged graft survival. Long-term combination drug treatment (days 0-100) followed by cessation of therapy resulted in permanent graft acceptance with no evidence for nitrosyl complex formation. These studies support a role of NO in cardiac allograft rejection. Furthermore, these studies indicate a potential therapeutic value of NO scavengers in preventing organ rejection.

Post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are usually Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders that vary in their morphologic spectrum. Extranodal marginal zone lymphomas of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-type (MALT-type) have not been considered to be part of this spectrum. The authors encountered five such cases recently. The clinical, histopathologic, and immunophenotypic features are reported. There were three men and two women with a mean age of 51.2 years (range, 48-63 years). Two patients were cardiac transplant recipients, two patients were liver transplant recipients, and the remaining patient was a renal transplant patient. Sites of lymphoma were the stomach in three patients and the parotid gland in two patients. Mean time to the lymphoma was 84 months after transplantation. All patients had morphologic features of low-grade extranodal marginal zone lymphomas of the MALT-type, and Helicobacter pylori was present in all three gastric cases. All patients exhibited the B-cell immunophenotype and were negative for EBV by in situ hybridization. These lymphomas were treated with a variety of modalities, including reduction of immunosuppression, antibiotics, surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. At last follow-up, one patient had developed signet ring adenocarcinoma at 27 months but had no evidence of PTLD, one patient relapsed at 17 months but is alive with stable disease at 24 months, and the remaining patients were alive without disease at 11, 12, and 14 months. Extranodal low-grade MALT-type lymphomas can occur in the post-transplantation setting and generally develop years after transplant. As seen in immunocompetent patients, EBV appears to play no role in the pathogenesis of these lymphomas. These lymphomas appear to have more in common with MALT-type lymphomas in nonimmunocompromised patients than conventional PTLDs, although they occur in \"at-risk\" patients due to their immunosuppressive therapy. These lymphomas do not appear to be clinically aggressive. Recognition of MALT-type lymphomas in the post-transplantation setting as an indolent disease avoids unnecessary treatment.

Radiologic findings consisted of a solitary pulmonary nodule (n = 3), mass with satellite nodules (n = 1), and obstructive pneumonitis (n = 1). In the sixth patient, the cancer was not radiographically visible because of obscuration by adjacent fibrosis.

During brief head-up tilt, skeletal muscle blood flow increased 13 +/- 42% in 9 severe CHF patients in contrast to a -28 +/- 22% decrease (P < 0.01) in 11 control subjects, -24 +/- 30% decrease in 15 moderate CHF patients (P < 0.05), -25 +/- 14% decrease in 12 patients with recent HTX (P < 0.01), and -21 +/- 24% decrease in 8 patients with distant HTX (P = 0.06). However, during sustained tilt, blood flow declined to similar levels of that in the other groups in severe CHF.

Renal dysfunction is one of the most common and threatening complications in heart transplant recipients.

The patients had a normal renal function before and 0.5 months after heart transplantation. Doubling of baseline serum creatinine or attainment of serum creatinine steadily above 176.8 micromol/l (2.0 mg/dl) was used as criterion to define the end-point renal dysfunction. A series of clinical and laboratory variables were obtained from the patients' charts at different time intervals, and their prognostic value for the occurrence of renal dysfunction was calculated by Cox proportional hazards models. 23 out of 114 patients reached the end point after a median time period of 21 months. High serum triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, ciclosporin, urea, glucose, and hemoglobin levels were shown to be associated with the development of renal dysfunction. Four variables, i.e., triglyceride, ciclosporin, urea, and alkaline phosphatase, had an independent prognostic value.

Fetal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes, stomach smooth muscle cells, skin fibroblasts, and adult human atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated and cultured in vitro. These cells were injected into or laid onto biodegradable gelatin meshes, and their rate of proliferation and spatial location within the mesh was evaluated by using a cell counter and histologic analysis. Rat cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts demonstrated steady proliferation over 3 to 4 weeks. The gelatin mesh was slowly degraded, but this process was most rapid after seeding with fibroblasts. Human atrial cardiomyocytes proliferated within the gelatin meshes but at a slower rate than that of fetal rat cardiomyocytes. Human ventricular cardiomyocytes survived within the gelatin mesh matrix but did not increase in number during the 2-week duration of evaluation. Grafts seeded with rat ventricular cells exhibited spontaneous rhythmic contractility. All cell types preferentially migrated to the uppermost surface of each graft and formed a 300- to 500-microm thick layer.

LEW (RT1l) heart grafts were implanted heterotopically into abdomens of LEW.1W (RT1u), and different types of cells were infused postoperatively. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate histopathological changes of grafts. In the absence of any immunosuppressive agents, a single dose of viable donor spleen cells (SC), but not bone marrow cells, was able to prolong heart allograft survival to about 21 days, while they were rejected promptly at day 7 in controls. Infusion of T cell-depleted donor SC, irradiated donor SC or third-party (BN) SC showed no effect on graft survival.

Decapeptides derived from human HLA class I sequences have been shown to prolong allograft survival. The mechanism of action of these peptides has been uncertain, because they act in an MHC unrestricted manner. Recently, it was found that these peptides bind heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). In the present study, we sought to determine whether local delivery of these peptides through gene transfer could extend allograft survival, and to explore the underlying mechanisms. C57BL/6 neonatal hearts were transplanted to CBA/J recipients and the peptide, or plasmid DNA encoding the peptide, was injected directly into the allograft at the time of the transplant. Direct injection of 1 microg of the B2702 peptide into the allograft did not prolong survival (13.3+/-0.8 vs. 13.4+/-0.8 days for untreated controls), but injection of 400 microg of peptide did extend survival (22.0+/-0.6). Injection of plasmid DNA encoding the B2702 peptide was superior to peptide delivery, extending graft survival to 30.8+/-1.5 days. Similar results were obtained using another plasmid encoding the rationally designed peptide BC1 (28.5+/-1.7), whereas no significant prolongation was observed using a plasmid encoding the control peptide B2705 (16.5+/-1.0). To explore the hypothesis that these peptides exert their immunosuppressive effect by altering HO-1 activity, animals were treated with iron protoporphyrin, an inducer of HO-1 activity, or tin protoporphyrin, an inhibitor of HO-1. Treatment with iron protoporphyrin alone extended graft survival (24.5+/-1.6) and did not alter the benefit in survival seen with BC1 gene transfer (28.0+/-0.8). In contrast, treatment with tin protoporphyrin abolished the benefit of BC1 gene transfer (17.0+/-0.6). These results demonstrate that plasmid mediated gene transfer is an effective means for delivering immunosuppressive peptides to extend allograft survival. The experiments suggest that these peptides may act by increasing HO-1 activity and support a role for HO-1 in immune regulation and allograft survival.

COX-2 upregulation paralleled in time and extent the upregulation of iNOS mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity in this model. COX-2 immunostaining was prominent in macrophages infiltrating the rejecting allografts and in damaged cardiac myocytes. Prostaglandin (PG) levels in rejecting allografts were also higher than in native hearts.

The maximal relaxation response to acetylcholine was significantly higher in the HTK than in the UW group after reperfusion, although there were no significant differences at each stage before reperfusion. In addition, the endothelium-independent relaxation response to sodium nitroprusside in the HTK group was also well preserved after reperfusion.

The goal of the present study was to directly compare the new radiopharmaceutical agent [(11)C]epinephrine (EPI) with [(11)C]hydroxyephedrine (HED) through the use of PET. Seven healthy volunteers and 10 patients were investigated after heart transplantation. PET images of both tracers were of excellent quality in the volunteers. Values for radiolabeled metabolites (measured in percent of blood activity) at 5, 20, and 60 minutes after injection were approximately 35%, approximately 82%, and approximately 86% for EPI and approximately 13%, approximately 47%, and approximately 78% for HED, respectively. At 35 minutes, metabolite-corrected mean myocardial retention fraction of EPI (0. 235+/-0.022 min(-1)) was significantly greater (P<0.01) than that of HED (0.142+/-0.012 min(-1)). Corrected tracer retention fractions of both EPI and HED were significantly reduced in transplant recipients (0.055+/-0.004 min(-1), P<0.0001; and 0.050+/-0.006 min(-1), P<0. 0001, respectively) compared with volunteers. Normalization of retention fractions of patients with transplantation within 1 year to volunteers resulted in a value (ratio expressed in percent) of 20. 6+/-1.8% for EPI, significantly (P<0.03) smaller than 27.8+/-0.8% for HED. In patients with transplantation later than 1 year, the values were 26.0+/-2.9% for EPI compared with 44.2+/-5.6% for HED (P<0.014). Both tracers showed high selectivity for neuronal uptake in the heart, with a significant reduction in tracer retention in transplant recipients compared with volunteers. Compared with HED, EPI showed greater retention in volunteers and a lower retention ratio in transplant recipients, suggesting that EPI may be the superior tracer with higher sensitivity to neuronal abnormalities. Because EPI reflects neuronal uptake, metabolism, and storage, it may be more suitable for the study of neuronal integrity than HED, which primarily traces uptake-1 capacity.

Th2 cells have been shown to exert cell-mediated immune responses in vitro; therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the cellular mechanisms of the long-term survival of cardiac xenografts by measuring cytokine production from recipient lymphocytes. Xenogeneic heart grafts from Lewis rats were transplanted into C57BL/6 mice, and the recipients were intravenously injected with H57-597 at the time of transplantation. The production of Th1 cytokines, namely, interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma, and Th2 cytokines, namely, IL-4 and IL-10, from mixed lymphocyte culture cells was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Splenocytes from the xenograft recipients treated with H57-597 produced significantly lower levels of IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-10 than those from the untreated recipients, 100 days after transplantation. The findings of this study indicate that the long-term survival of cardiac xenografts induced by H57-597 is mediated by the inhibition of Th0, or both the Th1 and Th2 response.

Transplant-accelerated arteriosclerosis in coronary arteries is the major limitation to long-term survival of patients with heart transplantation. The pathogenesis of this disease is not fully understood. Herein, we describe a simplified model of artery allografts in the mouse that allows us to take advantage of transgenic, knockout, or mutant animals. Common carotid arteries or aortic vessels were end-to-end allografted into carotid arteries between C57BL/6J and BALB/c mice. Neointimal lesions were observed as early as 2 weeks after surgery and had progressed at 4 and 6 weeks postoperatively. The lumen of grafted arteries was significantly narrowed due to neointima hyperplasia 4 weeks after transplantation. Using this model, we studied the role of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in the development of transplant arteriosclerosis in ICAM-1-deficient mice. Neointimal lesions of artery grafts from ICAM-1 -/- C57BL/6J to BALB/c mice were reduced up to 60% compared with wild-type controls. MAC-1 (CD11b/18)-positive cells adhering to the surface of ICAM-1 -/- artery grafts were significantly less as identified by en face immunofluorescence, and these positive cells were more abundant in intimal lesions of artery grafts in wild-type mice. Furthermore, the major cell component of neointimal lesions 4 weeks after surgery was found to be alpha-actin-positive smooth muscle cells, which were significantly reduced in lesions of ICAM-1 -/- artery grafts. Thus, this model has been proven to be useful for understanding the mechanism of transplant arteriosclerosis. Our findings demonstrate that ICAM-1 is critical in the development of allograft arteriosclerosis via mediation of leukocyte adhesion to, and infiltration into, the vessel wall.

The major problem of xenotransplantation is, that hyperacute xenograft rejection (HXR) causes graft failure within minutes or a few hours because of natural antibodies and activation of the complement system. As a preclinical model we transplanted pig hearts orthotopically into baboons. To prevent HXR after orthotopic xenotransplantation (oXHTx), the immunoglobulins (Ig) and natural antibodies were adsorbed to reusable Ig-Therasorb immunoadsorption (IA) columns. We performed three oXHTx of landrace pig hearts into baboons (19+/-6.8 kg), using extracorporeal circulation (ECC) connected to the IA unit. After separating the recipient's blood into plasma and cellular fraction by a plasma filter, plasma flow was directed to the Ig-Therasorb column coated with polyclonal sheep-antibodies against human IgG, IgM, and IgA. Intraoperative treatment consisted of 4 cycles of IA. For a control, we transplanted one pig heart into a baboon (16.9 kg) without applying IA. Perioperatively, serum concentrations of Ig, anti-pig-antibodies, complement and cardiac enzymes were determined. Tissue samples of myocardium were collected at the end of the study for immunohistochemical examinations, light microscopic examination (LM) and electron microscopic examination (EM). For cardiac monitoring after oXHTx, we used ECG, echocardiography, and invasive measurement of cardiac output. To prevent a mismatch of donor and recipient heart size, the donor pig had a 30-40% lower body weight than the recipient baboon. Four cycles of IA removed >80% of IgG, IgM, and IgA from plasma. The graft of the control animal failed after 29 min. The first oXHTx with IA was intentionally terminated after 100 min, the second oXHTx after 11 hr and the third oXHTx after 21 hr. All xenografts showed no histological signs of HXR. After weaning off ECC, these donor hearts worked in sinus rhythm without electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation. An excellent cardiac output was measured by echocardiography and thermodilution (2 L/min). Serological parameters indicating cardiac damage were significantly lower after IA if compared with the control experiment. Macroscopically, the xenograft of the control animal showed massive hemorrhage in comparison with the almost inconspicuous grafts after IA. The myocardium of the IA group demonstrated fewer deposits of Ig and complement components compared with the control animal. Baboons do not hyperacutely reject a porcine xenograft after antibody depletion by the Ig-Therasorb column. In our experiment only 4 cycles of immunoapheresis effectively prevented HXR after oXHTx of baboons. The Ig-Therasorb column is a reusable device, which can be handled easily in combination with the ECC. IA must be tested in oXHTx longterm survival experiments, especially in combination with transgenic pig organs, which could be a reliable preclinical approach for future clinical xenotransplantation.

As T-cell receptor-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I/self peptide interaction regulates T-cell development in the thymus, we reasoned that presentation of peptides by self dendritic cells (DC) to developing T cells in the thymus might induce acquired thymic tolerance. This hypothesis is based on the finding that intrathymic injection of allopeptides in the adult animal induces acquired tolerance. To examine this hypothesis, we studied the effects of intrathymic (IT) injection of a single immunodominant Wistar-Furth (WF) MHC class I (RT1.Au) peptide-pulsed host DC on islet allograft survival in the WF-to-ACI rat combination. Bone marrow-derived ACI DC expressing MHC class I and II, OX62, and ED2 present allopeptides to naive and specifically peptide-primed syngeneic T cells in mixed lymphocyte reaction. Host DC pulsed with RT1.Au peptide 5 (residues 93-109) were injected into the thymus of streptozotocin-induced diabetic ACI that were transplanted 7 days later with donor-type (WF) or third-party (Brown Norway [BN]) islets. Whereas IT injection of 300 microg of peptide 5 alone led to normoglycemia and permanent islet survival in three of six diabetic ACI recipients, similar treatment combined with simultaneous intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 ml of anti-lymphocyte serum (ALS) on day -7 led to 100% permanent islet allograft survival (>200 days) compared to a mean survival time of 15.0+/-2.3 days in controls treated with ALS alone. In contrast, similarly prepared animals rejected the third-party (BN) islets in an acute fashion. To address the question of indirect allorecognition in acquired thymic tolerance, we examined the effect of peptide-pulsed host DC on graft survival. Whereas IT injection of peptide-pulsed host DC alone resulted in permanent islet survival in two of five animals, IT injection of peptide-pulsed host DC combined with 0.5 ml of ALS induced 100% donor-specific permanent islet allograft survival in the WF-to-ACI rat combination. These results suggest that thymic DC take up, process, and present the administered peptide to the developing T cells by the indirect allorecognition pathway in the induction of acquired thymic tolerance. We have demonstrated a novel approach to inducing transplant tolerance to islet allografts with IT injection of allopeptide-pulsed host DC. This finding suggests that immunization strategies using DC expressing MHC allopeptides or peptide analogue might be potentially useful in the treatment of autoimmune diabetes mellitus.

We examined the role of nitrosative stress in allograft destruction. Rats undergoing cardiac transplants received NOX-100, a water-soluble nitric oxide (NO) scavenger with antioxidant properties, with or without low-dose cyclosporine (CsA). Graft survival, NO production, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity were studied. Using NOX-100 daily until rejection prolonged graft survival (11.6+/-0.6 vs. 7.4+/-0.2 days; P<0.05). Daily low-dose CsA (2.5 mg/kg im) for 7 days or until rejection also prolonged survival (12.6+/-0.5 and 21.6+/-1.6 days, respectively; P<0.01 vs. Controls). Low-dose CsA for 7 days and NOX-100 for 30 days prolonged graft survival (45.0+/-4.7 days; P<0.01 vs. all groups.). NOX-100 had no effect on whole blood CsA levels. Combination therapy until Day 100 resulted in 1 graft loss at Day 116 and indefinite survival in 3 animals (>300 days), which accepted a second WF strain heart without further immunosuppressive therapy but promptly rejected a third party (ACI) cardiac allograft. NOX-100 and CsA reduced nitrate and nitrite, and combination therapy completely normalized NO through to Day 30. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis demonstrated reduction of signals for nitrosylmyoglobin and nitrosyl-heme with NOX-100 and elimination of signals with CsA alone or combination therapy. Activity of myocardial NF-kappaB decreased with monotherapy vs. untreated allografts. Combination therapy resulted in further inhibition of NF-kappaB up to Day 30. The extent of graft survival correlated with the extent of NO scavenging and NF-kappaB inhibition. Short-term combination therapy had no effect on graft lymphocytic infiltrate on Days 15, 20, and 30. These data support a role for both oxidative and nitrosative stress in rejection and the immunoregulatory potential of antioxidant therapy after transplantation.

Surrogate tolerogenesis (ST), the induction of tolerance within the donor, is effective with aorta xenografts.

Tolerance to the donor pig was induced by infusing recipient marrow into fetal pigs. Later, pig splenocytes were transfused and heterotopic pig hearts transplanted using chimeric or nonchimeric pigs. Anti-pig antibodies were assessed. With ST alone, xenografts developed cellular rejection at 4-6 days, whereas control grafts developed vascular rejection at 3-4 days (cellular vs. vascular, P<0.03). There was a reduction in preformed antibodies (P<0.03). ST combined with moderate cyclosporine prevented rejection at 9+ and 25 days in sensitized recipients compared with vascular rejection at 0.5-2 days for controls (P<0.07). ST seems to provide protection against vascular rejection. The cellular rejection seems sensitive to cyclosporine.

CD4+ T cells play an essential role in allograft rejection. The monoclonal anti-rat CD4 antibody, RIB 5/2, has been shown to modulate the CD4 glycoprotein without eliminating the recipient T cells. We have successfully induced tolerance to rat heart allografts by recipient pretreatment with a single dose of RIB 5/2 plus intravenous administration of donor splenocytes. In this study, we explored whether this potent regimen could induce tolerance to the more resistant kidney and skin allografts. Furthermore, we examined the kinetics and requirements for tolerance to be met by a single dose of RIB 5/2 plus i.v. alloantigen. The efficacy of a single i.p. dose of 20 mg/kg RIB 5/2 plus i.v. donor antigen (25x10(6) splenocyte) pretreatment 0, 21, or 40 days before receipt of an MHC-mismatched Lewis (RT1l) to Buffalo (RT1b) rat cardiac, renal, or skin allograft was studied. Another group of Buffalo recipients treated with RIB 5/2 plus an i.v. alloantigen +/-thymectomy received kidney transplants after 40 days. Attempts to prevent tolerance used interleukin-2 or prior sensitization. Mixed lymphocyte cultures, cytotoxic assays, and precursor frequencies of helper and cytotoxic cells, by limiting dilution analysis, serially measured in vitro cell-mediated immunity. RIB 5/2 administration combined with i.v. alloantigen 21 days before induced tolerance to heart and kidney allografts but did not prolong skin graft survival. In contrast, kidney allografts delayed for 40 days after pretreatment were acutely rejected and survival was not affected by the thymectomy. MLC, CTL, and pTH, and pCTL precursor frequencies from recipients of long-term grafts were specifically suppressed to donor, but not third party, alloantigen. A single dose of the nondepleting anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody, RIB 5/2, plus i.v. alloantigen is a potent inducer of tolerance to heart and kidney, but not skin, allografts. The RIB 5/2-induced donor unresponsiveness to a delayed kidney or cardiac allograft is time dependent but can be prolonged if specific alloantigen is present. Suppression of cell-mediated allo-immune responsiveness correlates with allograft acceptance.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a brief course (4 days) of cyclosporine (CsA) on the development of IT tolerance. Buffalo (BUF) (RT1b) rats were given 25x10(6) fully MHC-mismatched Lewis (LEW) (RT1l) splenocytes by IT injection plus 1.0 ml of ALS intraperitoneally. Twenty-one days later, IT donor-specific LEW (group 1) or third-party (ACI, RT1a) (group 2) hearts were heterotopically transplanted to the abdominal aorta A third group of BUF (group 3) were given daily CsA (10 mg/kg) by oral gavage for 4 days before administration of IT LEW cells and ALS. Rejection as defined by the cessation of a palpable heartbeat was confirmed by histology. Cytokine profiles of allografts from all groups were then analyzed using a multi-probe RNase protection assay. Sixty-seven percent of IT/ALS-treated BUF recipients not pretreated with CsA accepted LEW heart grafts for greater than 90 days. However, 86% of animals treated with CsA for 4 days before IT injection and ALS rejected allografts at 10.7+/-3.2 days. Third-party allografts (ACI) were uniformly rejected (7.0+/-0.0 days). Histology confirmed cellular rejection in CsA-treated allografts and cytokine analysis detected increased interleukin (IL)-3, IL-5, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha when compared to increased IL-2 and interferon-gamma in rejecting untreated controls. CsA can prevent the induction of intrathymic alloantigen tolerance. These results support the development of a CsA-sensitive, but IL-2-independent, active regulatory mechanism after intrathymic exposure to donor-specific alloantigen and depletion of mature peripheral T cells.

To report a case demonstrating the importance of monitoring unbound valproic acid (VPA) serum concentrations in a patient with hypoalbuminemia. A 53-year-old white woman status-post heart transplantation was admitted to the hospital for declining cardiac function, possible rejection, and increased lethargy requiring intubation. An extensive workup of the patient's profound lethargy was initiated, including an evaluation of her VPA regimen. Initially, VPA dosages were adjusted based on the total serum concentration of VPA. Hypoalbuminemia compounded with increased lethargy prompted the measurement of unbound serum concentrations of VPA. The VPA dosage was then adjusted based on the unbound rather than the total VPA serum concentration; the patient eventually improved and was discharged from the hospital. Lethargy is a concentration-related adverse effect of VPA. The nonlinear pharmacokinetic and protein saturation characteristics of VPA may result in nonproportional elevations in unbound drug, and subsequent increases in adverse effects, when dosage adjustments are based solely on measurement of total VPA serum concentrations in patients with hypoalbuminemia. This case report suggests that appropriate monitoring of unbound drug concentrations of VPA may prevent unrecognized concentration-related adverse effects.

Our aim is to examine the types of cardiac malformations found in a population of children undergoing cardiac transplantation, and to discuss a method for examining cardiac explants based on intrinsic morphology. We describe in detail the congenital malformations found in 65 cardiac explants acquired from a population of children over a period of 15 years. The specimens were examined and diagnosed using the method of sequential segmental analysis. The most prevalent type of cardiac malformation was severe obstruction of the left heart (29. 2%), followed by double-outlet right ventricle (15.4%), complete transposition (13.8%), hearts with left-hand ventricular topology (10.8%), ventricular septal defect(s) (9.2%), tricuspid valvar agenesis (4.6%), and tetralogy of Fallot (4.6%). These abnormalities accounted for 87.6% of the specimens studied. We also cataloged the extracardiac malformations found at autopsy in those patients who died despite the transplantation. Extracardiac malformations were identified in 10 of the 19 patients who came to autopsy.

Donor-specific blood transfusion (DST), designed to prolong allograft survival, sensitized recipients of the high-responder PVG-RT1u strain, resulting in accelerated rejection of MHC-class I mismatched (PVG-R8) allografts. Rejection was found to be mediated by anti-MHC class I (Aa) alloantibody. By pretreating recipients 4 wk before grafting with cyclosporin A (CsA) daily (x7), combined with once weekly (x4) DST, rejection was prevented. The investigation explores the mechanism for this induced unresponsiveness. CD4 T cells purified from the thoracic duct of CsA/DST-pretreated RT1u rats induced rejection when transferred to R8 heart-grafted RT1u athymic nude recipients, indicating that CD4 T cells were not tolerized by the pretreatment. To determine whether B cells were affected, nude recipients were pretreated, in the absence of T cells, with CsA/DST (or CsA/third party blood) 4 wk before grafting. The subsequent transfer of normal CD4 T cells induced acute rejection of R8 cardiac allografts in third party- but not DST-pretreated recipients; prolonged allograft survival was reversed by the cotransfer of B cells with the CD4 T cells. Graft survival correlated with reduced production of anti-MHC class I (Aa) cytotoxic alloantibody. The results indicated that the combined pretransplant treatment of CsA and DST induced tolerance in allospecific B cells independently of T cells. The resulting suppression of allospecific cytotoxic Ab correlated with the survival of MHC class I mismatched allografts.

Blood samples were obtained from the right atrium via a pulmonary artery flotation catheter every 2 min over a 90 min period. Seven patients who underwent cardiac transplantation by the standard biatrial technique (partial innervation) and ten patients who underwent transplantation by the bicaval technique (total denervation) were studied. ANP levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. The median ANP levels were somewhat higher in the biatrial group compared to the bicaval group [470 (150-1095) vs. 216 (100-605) pg. ml(-1); median (range); P = ns], and both were much higher than normal levels in the pulmonary artery (40 (24, 56) pg ml(-1); median and interquartile range).

Computer analysis identified 12-16 and 6-15 'pulses' in the biatrial and bicaval group, respectively. Further analysis revealed that pulse amplitude, height and area were significantly higher in the biatrial compared to the bicaval group. It would appear that variability of circulating plasma levels of ANP is preserved despite complete or partial cardiac denervation, and so a neural mechanism does not appear to account for such variation.

Astonishingly, plasmapheresis, if carried out 2 days before transplantation, almost tripled xenograft survival, although preformed antibody levels were completely restored and even rebounding at the time of grafting. The pattern and number of infiltrating cells did not differ in dependence of the timing of plasmapheresis nor did the proliferative response of lymphocytes in the mixed lymphocyte reaction differ. However, plasmapheresis led to a retarded decrease of the mononuclear cell tumor necrosis factor alpha secretory potential, which correlated well with a diminished immunohistologic staining of tumor necrosis factor alpha secreted by graft-infiltrating mononuclear cells. These findings argue against a pivotal role of preformed xenoantibodies in the pathomechanistic process of delayed xenograft rejection and challenge the therapeutic strategy to reduce preformed xenoantibody levels before xenotransplantation in complement-inactivated recipients.

Hypothermic conditions required for donor heart preservation may reduce gene-transfer efficiency. Experiments were designed to determine whether a perfusion technique could improve the efficiency of gene transfer to donor hearts. An adenoviral vector encoding beta-galactosidase (3.5 x 10(8) plaque-forming units) was infused into explanted rat hearts under 4 conditions (each n = 6): (1) the virus was diluted in 350 microL of University of Wisconsin solution and infused as a high-pressure bolus into the coronary arteries of donor hearts through the aortic root; (2) the virus was diluted in 5 mL of University of Wisconsin solution and circulated by means of a peristaltic pump (flow, 0.75 mL/min) through the vasculature of the donor heart for 30 minutes; (3) 5 mL of viral solution was circulated as for group 2 for 15 minutes; and (4) 5 mL of viral solution was circulated for 5 minutes at a flow rate of 2.4 mL/min. Transduced hearts were transplanted into the abdomen of syngeneic rats, and transgene expression was assessed by means of immunoassay 4 days later. The median beta-galactosidase content was (1) 45.0 ng/mg protein (25th-75th percentile, 33-73 ng/mg), (2) 640 ng/mg protein (25th-75th percentile, 614-878 ng/mg), (3) 493.8 ng/mg protein (25th-75th percentile, 456-527 ng/mg), and (4) 503.3 ng/mg protein (25th-75th percentile, 475-562 ng/mg; P <.01 for group 2 vs group 1, and P <.05 for groups 3 and 4 vs group 1). Transgene expression was predominantly in myocytes and favored the subepicardial region of the right ventricle.

Long-term mechanical circulatory support as a bridge-to-transplantation procedure and bridge to recovery is of increasing importance. The implantable left ventricular assist devices, Novacor N100 left ventricular assist system (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Berkeley, Calif) and TCI HeartMate vented electric left ventricular assist system (Thermo Cardiosystems Inc, Woburn, Mass), have proved to be efficient devices in bridge-to-transplantation settings and for prolonged support. The two systems were compared with regard to reliability and morbidity. Between October 1996 and March 1998, a prospective, single-center study was done that included 40 patients, 20 of whom were treated with the Novacor system and 20 of whom were treated with the HeartMate device. The diseases were mainly dilated cardiomyopathy (13/9) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (6/10). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding age, sex, preoperative clinical blood chemistry values, hemodynamic data, or risk factors. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with regard to postoperative hemodynamics, organ recovery, out-of-hospital support, and survival to heart transplantation. Mean duration of support was 235.3 +/- 210 days for the Novacor group and 174.6 +/- 175 days for the HeartMate group and mean out-of-hospital support was 241 +/- 179 days and 166 +/- 152 days for the two groups, respectively. Neurologic complications occurred significantly more often among the Novacor group, whereas the HeartMate group had a higher prevalence of infections and technical problems, which was statistically significant. Survival to transplantation was 65% for the Novacor group and 60% for the HeartMate group. Most patients had organ recovery with left ventricular assist system support, and a considerable number of patients in both groups underwent transplantation. However, both devices need revision to address the current problems, that is, thromboembolism for the Novacor device and infection and reliability for the HeartMate device.

Immunologically sensitized recipients present one of the most critical problems in clinical organ transplantation today, since preformed antibodies rapidly destroy donor tissue expressing specific MHC class I antigens (Ag). Therefore, sensitized patients are either unable to receive a compatible organ, or experience a prolonged waiting period. In this study we examined the effectiveness of donor MHC class I gene therapy in preventing hyperacute rejection (HR) of rat heart allografts in passively sensitized recipients. Our gene therapy strategy to address this problem is based on the phenomenon that liver transplants, which resist antibody-mediated HR, produce soluble MHC class I Ag capable of neutralizing preformed antibodies and suppressing the immune response. To mimic this \"liver effect,\" we used liposomes to transfect cultured recipient (Lewis-RT1.Al) hepatocytes with plasmid DNA encoding the soluble donor MHC class I Ag, RT1.Aa. Control or RT1.Aa-transfected hepatocytes were implanted intrasplenically into Lewis recipients 1 day prior to heterotopic ACI (RT1.Aa) heart transplantation and injection of 6 ml of anti-ACI hyperimmune serum (HIS). Results showed that nearly all recipients receiving ACI-specific HIS and control hepatocytes experienced HR, while none of the recipients receiving HIS and hepatocytes expressing soluble RT1.Aa developed HR. Furthermore, active immunosuppression by soluble RT1.Aa was evidenced by prolongation of allograft survival, compared with controls not receiving HIS. In summary, soluble donor-MHC class I Ag gene therapy can prevent antibody-mediated destruction associated with HR. Future development of a similar strategy in humans may significantly improve the results of clinical organ transplantation in immunologically sensitized recipients.

Accelerated graft coronary atherosclerosis is the main obstacle to long-term survival in patients who have had a heart transplant. A possible involvement of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in this type of coronary atherosclerosis has been postulated by many authors but has not been definitively demonstrated. In an attempt to clarify the role of HCMV infection in the pathogenesis of this complication, we looked for in situ antigens or DNA of HCMV in 30 coronary artery segments obtained at necropsy from patients who had undergone orthotopic cardiac transplantation at the S\u00e3o Paulo Heart Institute. We tried to correlate these HCMV markers with the presence of inflammation and/or atherosclerosis in histologic sections. The patients were grouped as follows: GI, less than 170 days of graft survival and absent/mild atherosclerosis; GII, more than 170 days of graft survival and absent/mild atherosclerosis; GIII, more than 170 days of graft survival and severe/moderate atherosclerosis (170 days was the shortest graft survival time associated with atherosclerosis). The search for HCMV genome and antigens in the coronary artery sections was performed using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction in situ techniques. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed no evidence of HCMV in all 30 cases. Polymerase chain reaction in situ revealed scarce HCMV-positive lymphocytes in two cases (one each from GI and GIII) located in the adventitial layer. These findings preclude a direct role for the HCMV in the pathogenesis of accelerated graft coronary atherosclerosis. However, the possibility of an indirect effect of the virus, such as an immune-mediated inflammatory response by the host that increases the expression of histocompatibility antigens, leading to tissue injury, cannot be excluded.

Alloantigen-activated T cells express the high-affinity interleukin-2 receptor. Specific blockade of this receptor with the human IgG1 monoclonal antibody daclizumab may prevent rejection of allografts after cardiac transplantation without inducing global immunosuppression. We randomly assigned 55 nonsensitized patients undergoing a first cardiac transplantation to receive either induction therapy with daclizumab (1.0 mg per kilogram of body weight), given intravenously within 24 hours after cardiac-transplantation surgery and every two weeks thereafter, for a total of five doses, or generalized immunosuppressive therapy. Concomitant immunosuppression was achieved in both groups with cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. The primary end points were the incidence and severity of acute rejection, and the length of time to a first episode of biopsy-confirmed rejection. Of the 55 patients in the study, 28 were randomly assigned to receive daclizumab and 27 served as the control group. During induction therapy, the mean frequency of acute rejection episodes (defined as a histologic grade of 2 or higher according to the classification of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplants) was 0.64 per patient in the control group and 0.19 per patient in the daclizumab group (P=0.02). Acute rejection developed in 17 of 27 patients in the control group (63 percent), as compared with 5 of 28 patients in the daclizumab group (18 percent; relative risk, 2.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 7.4; P=0.04). Throughout follow-up, there were nine patients with episodes of acute rejection of histologic grade 3 in the control group, as compared with two in the daclizumab group (P= 0.03), and the time to a first episode of rejection was significantly longer in the daclizumab group (P=0.04). There were no adverse reactions to daclizumab and no significant differences between the groups in the incidence of infection or cancer during follow-up. Induction therapy with daclizumab safely reduces the frequency and severity of cardiac-allograft rejection during the induction period.

Heart transplantation in patients with increased pulmonary vascular resistance is often associated with postbypass right heart failure. We therefore compared the abilities of prostaglandin E(1) (PGE(1)) and inhaled nitric oxide to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance during heart transplantation. Patients undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation for congestive heart failure were randomly assigned to either a PGE(1) infusion at a rate of 8 ng. kg. (-1)min(-1) starting 10 min before weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (n = 34) or inhalation of 4 ppm nitric oxide starting just before weaning from CPB (n = 34). Both treatments were increased stepwise, if necessary, and were stopped 6 h postoperatively. Hemodynamic values were recorded after the induction of anesthesia, 10 and 30 min after weaning from CPB, and 1 h and 6 h postoperatively. Immediately after weaning from CPB, pulmonary vascular resistance was nearly halved in the nitric oxide group but reduced by only 10% in the PGE(1) group. Pulmonary artery pressure was decreased approximately 30% during nitric oxide inhalation, but only approximately 16% during the PGE(1) infusion. Six hours after surgery, pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure were similar in the two groups. The ratio between pulmonary vascular resistance and systemic vascular resistance was significantly less in the nitric oxide patients at all postbypass times. In contrast, the pulmonary-to-systemic vascular resistance ratio increased approximately 30% in the patients given PGE(1). Cardiac output, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, right atrial pressure, and pulmonary wedge pressure did not differ between the groups. Weaning from CPB was successful in all patients assigned to nitric oxide inhalation; in contrast, weaning failed in six patients assigned to PGE(1) (P = 0.03). Nitric oxide inhalation selectively reduces pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure immediately after heart transplantation which facilitates weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass.

Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) have been used successfully as a life-sustaining bridge to transplantation in adults with end-stage heart failure. Long-term implantable cardiac assist devices for smaller adolescent patients are not yet available in the United States. This study reviews the experience with patients less than 21 years old that received HeartMate LVADs (TCI) at our institution. Twelve patients were implanted with 13 LVADs. The patients ranged in age from 11 to 20 years (mean 16 years). Body surface area ranged from 1.4 to 2.2 m2 (mean 1.8 m2). Patients were selected for LVAD placement based on eligibility for heart transplant and evidence of end-organ dysfunction. Device placement in small patients was facilitated with prosthetic graft abdominal wall closure. No patient received systemic anticoagulation. The duration of LVAD support ranged from 0 to 397 days (mean 123 days). Seven of the 8 patients eligible for discharge from the hospital with a vented-electric LVAD were supported at home while awaiting transplantation. Outcomes of LVAD support were: LVAD explantation in 2 cases (15%), expiration with LVAD in place in 3 cases (23%), and successful transplantation in 8 cases (62%). Complications included 4 patients with systemic infection, 3 re-operations for hemorrhage, 1 embolic event, and 1 intraoperative air embolus that proved fatal. One explanted patient required a subsequent LVAD and the other expired 4 months after explantation. Six of the 8 transplanted patients are alive and well with follow-up ranging from 8 to 43 months. Adolescent patients with heart failure can be successfully supported on a long-term basis to heart transplantation with the HeartMate LVAD. The wearable device allows for discharge home while awaiting transplantation. Device explantation without subsequent transplantation can be unpredictable. The incidence of thromboembolism remains low despite the absence of systemic anticoagulation. The technique of prosthetic graft closure of the abdominal wall facilitates the use of this device in smaller patients.

Nitric oxide (NO) can exert negative inotropic and cytotoxic effects on cardiomyocytes. A number of studies have shown altered nitric oxide production by the endothelial constitutive isoform of nitric oxide synthase (NOS III), but there is little information on the role of NOS II. Expression of NOS II could lead to excessive production of NO in the myocardium and affect cardiac contractility.

This study examines the benefit of three-vessel imaging versus one-vessel imaging in detecting transplant vasculopathy. One hundred eleven transplant recipients with intravascular ultrasound imaging at baseline (within 2 months of transplantation) were studied: 107 at 1-year, 53 at 2-year and 41 at 3-year follow-up. A total of 222 arteries, 519 segments and 772 sites were analyzed (94 LAD, 65 LCX and 65 RCA).

Currently studies conflict on the impact on mortality of right bundle branch block development after transplantation. Most studies conclude that right bundle branch block does not affect patient survival. However, no distinction is made between patients in whom right bundle branch block progresses and those in whom it remains unchanged during follow-up. The objective of this study is to assess clinical or survival differences between patients who develop right bundle branch block and those who do not, and also to analyze these differences depending on progression of this conduction abnormality. Ninety-seven consecutive heart transplant recipients with more than 1 year's survival were analyzed. Twelve-lead standard ECGs were performed during the first week after transplantation, which allowed for classification of patients depending on the presence or absence of right bundle branch block. Subsequently, throughout the first year, 2 groups were identified, depending on increase of the conduction defect. The groups were compared and factors determining the presence of right bundle branch block and progression of the conduction defect were found. Survival curves for the conduction defect were also compared. Fifty percent of the patients developed right bundle branch block after transplantation; it was progressive in 10. Progressive right bundle branch block was related to greater renal dysfunction (odds ration [OR] = 10.8; confidence interval [CI] = 2-58; p = 0.006), a larger number of rejections (p = 0.01), and a greater death rate (OR = 12.8; CI = 2.5-64; p = 0.002). The presence of progressive right bundle branch block was an independent predictor of long-term mortality (OR = 27.9; CI = 4.2-186.3; p = 0.0006). The development of right bundle branch block after transplantation is related to intraoperative factors and to a greater number of rejections.

Inhibition of hyperacute rejection (HAR) and sustained graft survival have been demonstrated in a pig-to-primate model of heterotopic cardiac xenotransplantation using pigs transgenic for human Decay Accelerating Factor (hDAF). Building on this work, an orthotopic model has been developed. This case records 39-day cardiac xenograft function in a life-supporting capacity with clinically applicable immunosuppression. Using a heart from an hDAF transgenic pig, an orthotopic cardiac transplant was performed on an adult baboon. The immunosuppressive regimen consisted of induction with a short course of cyclophosphamide, followed by maintenance therapy with cyclosporine A, mycophenolate mofetil and a tapering course of corticosteroids. Post-operative monitoring included daily anti-pig hemolytic antibody titer surveillance and endomyocardial biopsy. The animal survived 39 days and was active and energetic throughout its postoperative course, remaining free of signs of cardiopulmonary failure. Endomyocardial biopsy performed on post-operative Day 36 revealed only patches of sub-endocardial fibrosis with no signs of active rejection. The baboon succumbed to an acute cardiopulmonary decompensation immediately following administration of medication via oral gavage. Post-mortem histopathology demonstrated well-preserved myocardial architecture with small foci of mild humoral rejection. This case documents the longest survival recorded to date of a discordant orthotopic cardiac xenograft and illustrates that the hDAF transgene combined with a clinically acceptable maintenance immunosuppressive regimen enables sustained, life-supporting function of porcine cardiac xenografts in non-human primates. The inhibition of hyperacute rejection and the subsequent control of humoral and cellular rejection for over 1 month demonstrated in this experiment represent significant progress in the development of a viable strategy for clinical xenotransplantation.

At day 55 after transplantation, cardiac grafts placed into STAT4 -/- (n=10) had reduced frequency (24+/-2%) and severity (9+/-4%) of vascular occlusion compared with wild-type controls (n=7, frequency 70+/-12% [P<0.001], severity 25+/-6% [P<0.05]). This decrease was associated with reduced intragraft expression ((32)P RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry) of the Th1 signature cytokines interferon-gamma (P<0.001) and interleukin (IL)-2 (P<0.001). Furthermore, cardiac grafts in STAT4 -/- had fewer infiltrating CD45(+) mononuclear cells (99+/-27 cells/mm(3) compared with 551+/-168 cells/mm(3) in wild-type controls [P<0.05]) and reduced expression of P-selectin (P<0.001) and E-selectin (P<0.01) ligand, recently shown to regulate Th1 cell recruitment.

Hence, we show that immune responses mediated by STAT4, but not STAT6, contribute to the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. We speculate that when present, STAT4-mediated signaling pathways may promote cardiac allograft vasculopathy by directing Th1-specific lymphocyte recruitment, activation, and effector functions.

To test whether IL-2- and IL-15-responsive T cells play an active role in rejection during anti-CD25 mAb therapy, we measured the frequency of IL-2- and IL-15-proliferative T cells in peripheral blood from treated patients during rejection (n=12). Measurements were made by limiting dilution analysis in the absence and presence of extra in vitro-added mouse anti-human CD25 mAb. In the absence of anti-CD25 mAb, the frequencies of peripheral T cells responding to recombinant human (rh)IL-2 and rhIL-15 from patients were lower than those measured in samples of healthy controls (n=7): median of IL-2-responding T cells 78 per 10(6) (range 31-210 per 10(6)) vs. 154 per 10(6) (122-484 per 10(6), P=0.008) and median of IL-15-responding T cells 62 per 10(6) (range 19-207 per 10(6)) vs. 129 per 10(6) (range 79-192 per 10(6), P=0.02), respectively.

The expression of mannose residues on cultured rat endothelial cells was examined after stimulation with interleukin 1 in the presence or absence of mycophenolic acid using labeled Galanthus nivalis agglutinin. The in vitro adhesion of blood leukocytes to heart tissue was examined using peripheral blood leukocytes of recipient origin and sections of donor heart tissue exposed to ischemia-reperfusion injury after pretreatment with vehicle or mycophenolic mofetil. (LEWxBN)F1 donor rats were treated with 20 or 60 mg/kg/day of mycophenolate mofetil for 1 or 2 weeks followed by transplantation of the heart into Lewis recipients after storage in heparin-containing normal saline for either 10 min at 4 degrees C or 120 min at room temperature. Endothelial cells stimulated in vitro with interleukin 1 showed an increase in a population of strongly mannose-positive cells, which was prevented by the addition of mycophenolic acid during the culture. The in vitro adhesion of peripheral blood leukocytes to cardiac tissue sections exposed to prolonged storage and reperfusion was significantly less if the donor had been treated with mycophenolate mofetil. Treatment of cardiac graft donors with mycophenolate mofetil protected the graft against early graft failure after prolonged storage at room temperature, because the mean graft survival was 9.4+/-0.6 days for grafts that came from donors treated with mycophenolate mofetil versus 1.2+/-0.9 days (P<0.05) for grafts that came from vehicle-treated donors. Donor pretreatment with mycophenolate mofetil did not affect the survival time of heart grafts transplanted after 15 min of standard cold storage or the survival of grafts transplanted into presensitized recipients. Donor treatment with mycophenolate mofetil protects cardiac grafts against primary nonfunction after prolonged tepid storage, which may be related to the inhibition of glycosylation of cell adhesion molecules involved in ischemia-reperfusion injury.

The beneficial effect on graft survival achieved by pretransplant blood transfusions is well established. Previous studies have shown that the degree of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (mis)-match between the transfusion donor and the recipient plays a determining role. However, other factors are also involved. In this study, we explored the hypothesis that, in addition to sharing of MHC antigens between the transfusion donor and the recipient, the MHC type of the organ donor is also of importance. To mimic the human situation, F1 mice, rather than inbred strains, were pretreated with haplotype-shared allogeneic whole blood transfusions and transplanted with hearts of organ donors with different matched or mismatched H2 haplotypes. When a heart was transplanted 1 week after donor-specific transfusion (DST; blood transfusion donor=organ donor), an excellent prolongation of graft survival was obtained (median survival time: 77 days vs. 9 days in untreated mice). However, this was only the case when a haplotype was shared with the recipient; a DST given with no match between organ donor (=BT donor) and recipient did not induce any prolongation. Furthermore, in order to obtain the optimal beneficial effect of a haplotype-shared blood transfusion, the other haplotype of the transfusion donor had to be mismatched with the recipient. The immunogenetic studies showed that haplotype-shared blood transfusions in combinations where the H2 type of the organ donor differed from that of the transfusion donor are less efficient in inducing prolongation of graft survival. These results demonstrate that haplotype-shared blood transfusions can induce a significantly prolonged survival of cardiac allografts in F1 mice. The immunogenetic studies suggest that presentation of alloantigen-derived peptides in the context of self MHC (the indirect pathway of allorecognition) is essential for the beneficial effect of haplotype-shared blood transfusions.

Recently, homocysteine (HCY) levels have been suggested to be a risk factor in cardiac allograft vascular disease (CAVD). As plasma levels are partially under genetic control, we investigated the influence of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphism on HCY levels and development of CAVD in heart transplant (HTX) recipients. Genotyping and assessment of fasting HCY levels were performed in a cohort of 146 HTX recipients and correlated to the onset and progression of CAVD, assessed by serial angiography. Actuarial freedom from CAVD did not differ significantly between the genotypes. However, patients positive for CAVD presented with higher HCY levels than CAVD-negative individuals (21.0+/-9.4 vs. 18.2+/-6.6 micromol/L, P=0.046). There is some evidence that plasma HCY might be involved in development of CAVD. However, polymorphism of the MTHFR gene could not be shown to be related to severity of allograft vascular disease.

It is thought that most autoreactive T cells are deleted in the thymus during the process of negative selection. However, peripheral tolerance mechanisms also exist to prevent development of autoimmune diseases against peripheral self-Ags. It has been proposed that T cells develop tolerance to peripheral self-Ags encountered in the absence of inflammation or \"danger\" signals. We have used immunodeficient Rag 1-/- mice to study the response of T cells to neo-self peripheral Ags in the form of well-healed skin and vascularized cardiac allografts. In this paper we report that skin and cardiac allografts without evidence of inflammation are vigorously rejected by transferred T cells or when recipients are reconstituted with T cells at a physiologic rate by nude bone graft transplantation. These results provide new insights into the role of inflammation or \"danger\" in the initiation of T cell-dependent immune responses. These findings also have profound implications in organ transplantation and suggest that in the absence of central deletional tolerance, peripheral tolerance mechanisms are not sufficient to inhibit alloimmune responses even in the absence of inflammation or danger.

Lymphocytic myocarditis causes left ventricular dysfunction that may be persistent or reversible. There are no clinical criteria that predict which patients will recover ventricular function and which cases will progress to dilated cardiomyopathy. We hypothesized that patients with fulminant myocarditis may have a better long-term prognosis than those with acute (nonfulminant) myocarditis. We identified 147 patients considered to have myocarditis according to the findings on endomyocardial biopsy and the Dallas histopathological criteria. Fulminant myocarditis was diagnosed on the basis of clinical features at presentation, including the presence of severe hemodynamic compromise, rapid onset of symptoms, and fever. Patients with acute myocarditis did not have these features. The incidence of the end point of this study, death or heart transplantation, was ascertained by contact with the patient or the patient's family or by a search of the National Death Index. The average period of follow-up was 5.6 years. A total of 15 patients met the criteria for fulminant myocarditis, and 132 met the criteria for acute myocarditis. Among the patients with fulminant myocarditis, 93 percent were alive without having received a heart transplant 11 years after biopsy (95 percent confidence interval, 59 to 99 percent), as compared with only 45 percent of those with acute myocarditis (95 percent confidence interval, 30 to 58 percent; P=0.05 by the log-rank test). Fulminant myocarditis was an independent predictor of survival after adjustments were made for age, histopathological findings, and hemodynamic variables. The rate of transplantation-free survival did not differ significantly between the patients considered to have borderline myocarditis and those considered to have active myocarditis according to the Dallas histopathological criteria. Fulminant myocarditis is a distinct clinical entity with an excellent long-term prognosis. Aggressive hemodynamic support is warranted for patients with this condition.

Acute vascular rejection destroys vascularized xenografts over a period of hours to days and is now considered the major hurdle to the clinical application of xenotransplantation. The hallmark of acute vascular rejection is diffuse intravascular coagulation; however, the pathogenesis of coagulation is a matter of controversy. One line of evidence points to activated endothelial cells and another to activated inflammatory cells as a source of tissue factor and thus as a primary cause of this lesion. The distinction between the two mechanisms inducing coagulation in the xenograft provides an opportunity for specific intervention. To explore these mechanisms, we studied the expression of tissue factor mRNA by in situ reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in relation to the histopathologic manifestations of acute vascular rejection in guinea pig hearts transplanted into rats treated by cobra venom factor to avoid the hyperacute rejection. Three hours after transplantation and before the deposition of fibrin, tissue factor mRNA was expressed in the endothelial cells lining small and medium blood vessels and in smooth muscle cells of guinea pig cardiac xenografts. Sixteen hours after transplantation, while rat tissue factor mRNA was expressed only in occasional infiltrating cells, cardiac xenografts showed prominent deposits of fibrin in small vessels. Maximum expression of tissue factor on rat infiltrating cells was observed 48 hr after transplantation. These results suggest that in acute vascular rejection, coagulation is initiated on the donor vascular system, while the procoagulant characteristics of infiltrating cells may reflect a response to tissue injury rather than a cause.

Alterations in plasma lipid profile are frequent in heart transplant (HT) patients, but they seem not to be prominent. Currently, the metabolism of chylomicrons, the lipoproteins that carry dietary lipids absorbed by the intestine, was evaluated because chylomicron remnants are considered atherogenic. An emulsion labeled with 3H-triolein and 14C-cholesteryl oleate and known to mimic the metabolic behavior of chylomicrons was injected intravenously after a 12-hr fast into 34 HT patients, 24 patients with end-stage heart failure (ESHF), and 30 healthy normolipidemic subjects. The plasma disappearance curves of the radioisotopes were determined from blood samples collected over 1 hr. In some of the patients and in controls, in vitro postheparin lipolytic activity was measured and an oral fat load test with postprandial measurement of triglyceridemia was performed. Fractional clearance rate (in m(-1), median [25%; 75%]) of both emulsion 3H-triolein and 14C-cholesteryl oleate was extremely diminished in HT patients (HT: 0.0114 [0.0114; 0.0179] and 0.2x10(-8) [0.2x10(-8); 0.0041, respectively]; ESHF: 0.0226 [0.0223; 0.0568] and 0.0160 [0.0055; 0.0189]; control subjects: 0.0270 [0.0226; 0.0392] and 0.0090 [0.0042; 0.0180], respectively, P<0.05). HT patients also had reduced postheparin lipolysis and marked elevation of postprandial triglyceridemia compared with the controls.

Previous studies showed that Lewis rats given posttransplant total lymphoid irradiation, antithymocyte globulin, and a single infusion of ACI peripheral blood or bone marrow cells develop tolerance to ACI heart allografts. To determine the effects of cyclosporine on these tolerance induction protocols, groups of Lewis hosts, given either ACI blood or marrow infusions, were given a 60-day course of daily cyclosporine immediately after the cell infusion. Cyclosporine treatment was associated with uniform graft rejection in the groups given an ACI blood transfusion, and was associated with uniform graft acceptance in the groups given an ACI bone marrow infusion. Studies of donor-type T and B cell chimerism in the host blood showed that cyclosporine facilitated chimerism in the hosts given ACI bone marrow cells, and stable chimerism over a 300-day observation period was predicted by detectable chimerism by day 30.

One of several proteins involved in this process is CD44, which is known to interact with endothelial hyaluronan (HA). Blockade of cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions have been used extensively for modulation of immune responses and graft rejection. Based on these observations, we evaluated the effects of blocking CD44-HA interactions in a transplantation model.

LMWHA was administered intraperitoneally at 0.5-5 mg/kg for 5-10 days after transplantation with or without a subtherapeutic dose of cyclosporine. LMWHA monotherapy prolonged allograft survival significantly, but only for a few days. In combination with low-dose cyclosporine, long-term survival of allografts was observed in some of recipients.

Oxidized LDL was measured in 99 cardiac transplant patients with normal coronary angiograms at baseline and was measured again after a median follow-up of 2 years at the time of a second angiogram. Twenty-one patients developed angiographically detectable cardiac transplant vasculopathy (cases), and 78 individuals did not (controls).

A high cholesterol diet was fed to donor and recipient swine 1 month before and after transplantation. The endothelial function of coronary arteries of native and transplanted hearts from cholesterol-fed animals was studied in organ chambers 30 days after implantation and compared with endothelial function in arteries from animals fed a normal diet. The total serum cholesterol increased 3-fold in donors and recipients. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to serotonin, to the alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist UK14,304, and to the direct G-protein activator sodium fluoride were decreased significantly in allografted hearts compared with native hearts from both groups. Relaxations to the calcium ionophore A23187 and bradykinin were decreased significantly in allografts from animals fed the high cholesterol diet. The prevalence of intimal hyperplasia was significantly increased in coronary arteries from hypercholesterolemic swine. There was a significant increase in the lipid content of allograft arteries of hypercholesterolemic recipients.

A prospective group (n = 28) of 18 Caucasian (white) children (9 female and 9 male, ages 4-10 years) and 10 Hispanic children (3 female and 7 male, ages 4-10 years) were evaluated. No attempt was made for either study group to delineate on individuals specific country of origin. None of the subjects had undergone orthodontic therapy. All subjects had heart transplantations before 6 months of age and followed the Loma Linda University International Pediatric Heart Transplantation Immunosuppression protocol. The primary immunosuppression agent was cyclosporine with azathioprine or methotrexate. Rescue therapy for graft rejection consisted of glucocorticoid and/or polyclonal antibody therapy. None of the subjects received the immunosuppressant tacrolimus (FK506). Using lateral cephalometric radiography, seven skeletal angular measurements (SNA, SNB, ANB, GoGn-SN, NA-Pog, ArGoMe, NPog-AB) were examined and compared to contemporary growth standards. Hand/wrist radiographs were evaluated for bone age. Also, longitudinal height, weight, and head circumference data was obtained and compared to standardized growth and development curves. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. Cephalometrically, 86% (N = 24), showed minor deviation from mean normative values. Four of the subjects (14%) exhibited cephalometric measures indicative of individuals with a vertical growth pattern. Analysis of the hand/wrist radiographs showed all but one subject to have normal bone age. Height, weight, and head circumference data revealed a wide range of growth percentiles for the entire group with mean percentiles in the range of 25% to 50%. The findings of this pilot study indicated that, in general, skeletal growth of the craniofacial complex as well as axial skeletal growth was not statistically significantly altered by the immunosuppressive regimen of cyclosporine over the time period evaluated.

Experience with ICUS in pediatrics, however, has been limited. By using ICUS we sought to determine the overall prevalence of TxCAD in pediatrics and to characterize factors associated with its development in this population. Eighty-six studies were performed in 51 pediatric patients a median of 3.4 years after heart transplantation. Evaluation included angiography and ICUS in 83 and angiography alone in 3 studies. Donor and recipient characteristics were obtained. The ICUS images were analyzed for intimal thickening and compared with coronary angiograms. The presence of any intimal thickening on ICUS was considered TxCAD. An intimal index and point of maximal intimal thickening (MIT) were measured. Vessel disease was graded 0 to 4 based on these results. Four patients had evidence of vasculopathy by angiography, whereas 32 patients (63%) had evidence of intimal proliferation by ICUS.

The physiological consequences of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression were studied in allograft coronary arteries by pressure myography. Septal coronary arteries (diameter, 200.6+/-3.3 microm) were harvested from allograft and isograft hearts, and their myogenic properties were measured before and after iNOS and nonselective NOS inhibition with aminoguanidine (AG, 100 micromol/L) and N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (200 micromol/L). Fura 2 fluorescence microscopy was used to measure [Ca(2+)](i) in isolated endothelial cells. Monoclonal anti-iNOS immunostains demonstrated iNOS protein in day 2, 7, 14, and 28 allograft vessels, but only in day 2 isograft vessels. Myogenic tone was profoundly inhibited in allograft vessels from day 4 onward. In day 4 allograft vessels, these differences were abolished by L-NAME but not AG, suggesting greater basal release of eNOS-based NO from allograft endothelium. Fluorescence measurements confirmed elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) in day 4 allograft endothelium, providing a mechanism for enhanced eNOS activity. For days 7 to 28, AG potentiated myogenic tone in allograft but not isograft vessels, indicating that vasoactive iNOS-based NO was present. In mature vessels, constriction via agonist- and depolarization-mediated mechanisms showed parallel inhibition, suggesting an intrinsic defect in vascular smooth muscle cell contraction. Our data indicate that the profound inhibition of myogenic tone in allograft arteries involves direct vasodilation by eNOS- and iNOS-based NO, as well as an intrinsic defect in vascular smooth muscle contraction. The hemodynamic profile resulting from these changes in allograft resistance vessel function would favor movement of extracellular fluid from the intravascular space into the myocardial interstitium, resulting in edema, increased ventricular stiffness, and poor ventricular performance.

Cardiac allograft arteriosclerosis, which limits long-term survival of recipients, cannot be prevented by conservative therapies. The arteriopathy is characterized by diffuse intimal thickening comprised of proliferative smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Cell death is a prominent feature of atherosclerosis; Bcl-x is one of the anti-apoptotic mediators. To test the hypothesis that antisense bcl-x oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) is effective in preventing intimal hyperplasia through enhancing apoptosis after cardiac transplantation, we performed single intraluminal delivery of antisense bcl-x ODN into murine cardiac allografts (n = 9). DBA/2 (H-2d) hearts were transplanted into B10.D2 (H-2d) mice. Sense bcl-x ODN (n = 8) and no treatment (n = 8) studies were also performed. Allografts were harvested at 4 weeks after transplantation; all allografts kept beating throughout the period. Coronary intimal thickening had developed in nontreated and sense ODN transfected allografts at 4 weeks after transplantation with enhanced expression of Bcl-x and cell adhesion molecules, and suppressed apoptosis. However, antisense bcl-x ODN prevented neointimal formation through enhanced apoptosis. These results indicate that apoptosis of vascular SMCs induced by Bcl-x is associated with initial hyperplasia after heart transplantation. Antisense bcl-x ODN inhibits SMC proliferation by inducing apoptosis in graft coronary arteries.

Recent data indicate that oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) has several proatherogenic effects, e.g. induction of macrophage chemoattractants, adhesion molecules, cytokines, type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor and platelet-derived growth factor A-chain by smooth muscle cells. Therefore, ox-LDL has been utilized as a marker of oxidative modification of proteins in atherosclerosis. Because heart valves consist of smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells, and because valvular disease and coronary atherosclerosis could result from similar biological processes, we investigated ox-LDL accumulation in isolated aortic and pulmonary valves and coronary arteries from patients with angiographically proven coronary heart disease (CHD, n = 19), patients with idiopathic congestive heart failure (IDCM = idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, n = 20), and transplant donors. Masson-Goldner staining and immunohistochemistry utilizing anti ox-LDL and CD68 were performed on paraffin sections of freshly isolated semilunar valves. Data were analyzed by digital image planimetry and by visual scoring of staining intensity. Ox-LDL immunoreactivity was identified in the vascular aspect of the attachment line, in the deep valve stroma, and in the ventricular and vascular endothelium of the semilunar valves, colocalizing with macrophages. Valvular ox-LDL area was significantly increased in CHD-patients (P < 0.03) and IDCM-patients (P < 0.04) compared with controls. More ox-LDL was accumulating in the pulmonary valves than in the aortic valves (P = 0.04) as assessed by area and staining intensity. Valvular ox-LDL area in pulmonary valve and aortic valve was significantly correlated with ox-LDL accumulation in the intimal layer (P < 0.001) and medial layer (P < 0.001) of coronary arteries from the same patients. The data suggest that the biological process leading to ox-LDL accumulation in coronary atherosclerosis also involves heart valves. Therefore, accumulation of the oxidative stress marker ox-LDL in heart valves illustrates atherosclerosis as an additional mechanisms accelerating valvular degeneration in these patients.

Heart transplantation (HTx) is associated with autonomic denervation of the donor heart. Sympathetic reinnervation (RI) as defined by the presence of functional nerve terminals occurs only if sympathetic ganglia outside the heart are connected with nerve terminals in the transplanted heart. The purpose of this study was to define the incidence and functional consequences of RI over time after HTx. The activity and distribution of norepinephrine (NE) uptake sites were assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Symptom limited exercise testing was performed by bicycle-ergometer. Forty-seven patients (m:f=42:5, 47.6+/-8. 2 years, age range 27-65 years) were investigated between 2 months and 13.6 years after HTx using PET and the NE analogue C-11-hydroxyephedrine (HED). Tracer uptake was quantified using dynamic imaging protocols yielding regional HED retention fraction. A regional value above 7%/min (+/-2.5 SD above the mean value of denervated hearts) was considered evidence for RI. The functional significance of RI was investigated in 34 patients (m:f=30:4, 49. 3+/-8.4 age range 27-62 years) by symptom limited exercise testing. Cardiac catheterization was performed at the time of PET imaging. RI could not be assessed in the first year after HTx, in 11% in the second year and in 80% of the patients from the third year on. Retention values plateaued then. In all time intervals, beyond the third year, not reinnervated patients were found. RI remained incomplete and was always restricted to the anterior wall of the left ventricle. Extent of retention of the left ventricle revealed a large individual range up to 66%, averaging of 20%. Recipient age at the time of HTx, reinnervated patients were 5.5 years younger than not reinnervated ones, proved as the only significant influencing factor for RI (P<0.05). Dividing patients into scintigraphically reinnervated (n=20) and not reinnervated (n=14), reinnervated patients displayed during exercise a higher maximal heart rate (137+/-14 vs. 123+/-20/min, P<0.05), heart rate increase (40+/-15 vs. 28+/-13/min, P<0.05), max. oxygen consumption (1674+/-424 vs. 1279+/-308 ml/min, P<0.01) and anaerobic threshold (887+/-170 vs. 717+/-183 mlO(2)/min, P<0.01) than not reinnervated ones.

Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is a frequent sequel to cardiac transplantation, but the role of cytokines on the subsequent development of vasculopathy is still largely unknown. We retrospectively studied 172 heart transplant recipients to investigate the relationship between the development of vasculopathy and various factors including the presence of transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) in the graft. Endomyocardial biopsy specimens were stained with antibodies for TGF-beta and CD+68, and a TGF-beta staining score was derived. Vasculopathy was diagnosed by angiography and rejection was graded according to the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation classification. TGF-beta(1) genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis of DNA. After a mean follow-up period of 68 +/- 32 months, the prevalence of significant vasculopathy was 52%. The TGF-beta staining score was higher in patients with more severe vasculopathy (95% confidence interval = 8.9-12.1) than in those who showed minimal or mild vasculopathy score changes of more than 7 (95% confidence interval = 3.4-5.1), P =.0001. TGF-beta expression correlated with the degree of vasculopathy (r = 0.73, P <.0007) during the study period. Risks for vasculopathy were recipient homozygous TGF-beta genotype, recurrent rejection, recipient history of ischemic heart disease, donor male sex, old donor age (years), and donor history of subarachnoid hemorrhage. A strong association exists between the expression of TGF-beta in cardiac biopsy specimens and the development of vasculopathy. TGF-beta in the cardiac allograft is related to its genotype and to the number of rejection episodes. Strategies to down-regulate TGF-beta production might improve the outcome of cardiac allografts.

Recipients of major histocompatibility complex class I disparate allografts received 12 days of cyclosporine (INN: cyclosporin; 10-13 mg/kg administered intravenously on days 0-11). Group 1 animals received a heart alone (n = 5). Group 2 animals received heart and kidney allografts (n = 4). Group 3 animals received two major histocompatibility complex-matched heart allografts (n = 4). Two double-heart recipients were thymectomized 21 days before transplantation. Group 4 animals received a heart allograft and an infusion of high-dose donor peripheral blood leukocytes (2.5 x 10(9) cells/kg, n = 2). Vasculopathy developed in group 1 recipients and the allografts were rejected within 55 days. Group 2 recipients accepted their heart and kidney allografts indefinitely without vasculopathy. Euthymic recipients from group 3 accepted their hearts long-term (>190 and >197 days), but vascular lesions developed. In thymectomized recipients from group 3, the hearts were rejected in 63 and 96 days with severe vasculopathy. Group 4 recipients demonstrated transient macrochimerism but their hearts were rejected within 47 and 63 days.

This technique was applied in pig hearts, which we transplanted orthotopically after cardioplegic arrest by original (n = 5) and modified (addition of hyaluronidase: n = 11) Bretschneider HTK solution and 14 h of hypothermic preservation. Depending on the different preservation techniques, we created four groups: (1), original HTK (HTK), n = 5; (2), modified HTK (mHTK), n = 5; (3), modified HTK solution plus COP (mHTK + COP), n = 6; and (4), as a control five hearts were transplanted after cardioplegic arrest by the original HTK solution and a cold ischemia time of 3 h comparable to clinical routine procedure. After 14 h of preservation and orthotopic transplantation, cardiac functional recovery in mHTK + COP hearts was similar to control hearts, and improved compared to hearts of both other groups. Hemodynamics were significantly better in hearts preserved by mHTK + COP and in the control group compared to the HTK-hearts (P < 0.05), not significant compared to mHTK hearts (dp/dt(max) in % of preoperative +/- standard error of mean (SEM): mHTK + COP, 85 +/- 9; control, 85 +/- 10.5; mHTK, 59 +/- 14; HTK, 50 +/- 4).

Myocardial specimens from the left ventricular wall of explanted hearts were obtained from subjects with ischemic (n = 6) or nonischemic dilated (n = 8) cardiomyopathy. Assays for citrate synthase (CS) and complexes II/III and IV activity were performed on cardiac mitochondria and homogenate.

A significant reduction in COX and/or CS activity was identified in mitochondrial preparations from the transplant group and correlated significantly with ejection fraction (P < .05), although this does not prove a causal relationship. Significantly reduced CS activity in homogenate was identified, suggesting decreased mitochondrial volume in addition to decreased COX activity. Measurements in cardiac homogenates failed to show a significant reduction in COX activity (P > .05) in the transplant group, suggesting that the use of prefrozen tissue homogenates may underestimate existing mitochondrial respiratory defects in cardiac tissue.

The clinical outcome after chemotherapy was poor because of infectious complications and resistant disease. With a median follow-up of 4 months, the median survival time of these patients was 7 months. Late occurring lymphomas could be considered an entity distinct from PTLD, occurring within 1 year of transplant, because they show a histological and clinical presentation similar to lymphomas of immunocompetent subjects, are frequently negative for the EBV genome, are invariably clonal, and may rearrange the c-myc oncogene. New therapeutic strategies are required to reduce the mortality rate, and new modalities of long-lasting immunosuppression are called for.

Cardiac allograft vasculopathy after heart transplantation leads to an accelerated form of atherosclerosis with marked and often diffuse vessel wall changes that limit long-term survival. Previous studies showed contradictory results relating vessel wall changes to endothelial vasodilator response. A total of 30 cardiac transplant recipients were studied 3, 12, and 24 months after heart transplantation. Coronary angiography was performed at rest, during supine bicycle ergometry, and after 1.6 mg sublingual nitroglycerin. Coronary cross-sectional area (biplane coronary angiography) and coronary artery wall changes (intravascular ultrasound) were assessed and extent of intimal changes correlated to vasodilator responses to nitroglycerine and bicycle ergometry. Intravascular ultrasound showed significant intimal thickening in 43, 64, and 58% of patients at 3, 12, and 24 months. Intimal thickening 3 months after transplantation was related to donor age (r=0.70, P<0.01) but did not predict progression of disease that manifested itself angiographically as a decrease in coronary cross-sectional area at 12 and 24 months (P<0.005) and significant coronary stenosis in 12% of patients after 24 months. Endothelium-independent vasodilatation after nitroglycerin (33+/-15, 44+/-20, and 43+/-24%) was normal. Endothelium-dependent, flow-induced vasodilatation during exercise was decreased (14+/-11, 18+/-14, and 16+/-17%) but did not correlate to intimal changes assessed by ultrasound. The study confirms the high incidence of intimal thickening after heart transplantation as assessed by intravascular ultrasound. Impaired exercise-induced vasodilatation suggests diminished bioavailability of endothelium-derived nitric oxide to physiological stimulation but the lack of relationship between coronary wall changes and this functional impairment suggests intermittent and presumably reversible endothelial injury in graft atherosclerosis.

Organ transplantation is associated with a greatly increased risk of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disease (LPD), which is often fatal. There has been little epidemiological analysis, however, of the risk factors for LPD in transplant patients and none on whether the risks of non-EBV-associated lymphoid neoplasms are also increased. The risk of lymphoid neoplasia was assessed in a cohort of 1563 patients who underwent cardiothoracic transplantation at Harefield Hospital, UK from 1980 to 1994 and were followed until December 1995. EBV antibody was assessed in the patients before transplantation, and lymphoid neoplasms were assessed for EBV RNA and latent EBV gene expression. Thirty cases of LPD occurred during follow-up. One lymphoma of unknown EBV status occurred. There were also six cases of EBV-negative non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (EBV-negative NHL), a highly significant excess over expectations from the general population rates of NHL (standardized incidence ratio 10.2 [95% confidence interval, 4.6-22.8]). The risk of LPD was significantly 10-fold raised in individuals who were EBV seronegative before transplantation; independently of this, it decreased steeply with age at transplantation and was greatest in the first year after transplantation. The risk was significantly raised in young seronegative recipients if the donor was older than the recipient. EBV-negative NHL occurred entirely in men 45 years old and older who were EBV seropositive before transplantation, and risk was not related to duration since transplantation. The risk factors found for LPD accord with EBV etiology and with greater hazard from primary infection than from reactivation. A second non-Hodgkin's lymphoid neoplasm, not related to EBV, seems also to be a consequence of transplantation and immunosuppression but is unlikely to be due to first infection by a ubiquitous agent. Its etiology and prevention need investigation separately from LPD. ", "label": 0}{"text": "Absence of host B7 expression is sufficient for long-term murine vascularized heart allograft survival. CD28 antagonists have been shown to promote long-term graft survival and induce donor-specific tolerance. In this study, the role of CD28/B7 costimulation and the relative importance of host versus donor B7 expression in allograft rejection was assessed in a murine abdominal vascularized heterotopic heart transplant model. Wild-type, CD28-deficient, or B7-1/B7-2-deficient C57BL/6 (B6) mice were grafted with allogeneic wild type or B7-1/B7-2-deficient hearts. The results demonstrate allogeneic heart grafts survive long-term in mCTLA4Ig-treated B6 and untreated B7-1/B7-2-deficient B6 recipients but not CD28KO B6 mice. B7-1/B7-2KO B6 recipients treated with anti-CD28 (PV-1) or recombinant human IL-2 rejected the heart transplants indicating that these mice are immunologically competent to reject grafts if costimulatory signals are supplied or bypassed. Finally, there was no difference in rejection between normal animals transplanted with wild-type versus B7-1/B7-2-deficient hearts. These results support a critical role for B7-expressing host antigen presenting cells in the rejection of heart allografts in mice and differences among B7KO and CD28KO animals.

Infectious pseudoaneurysms of the ascending aorta are a recognized major complication after heart-lung transplantation. This report describes an unusual and previously unreported complication, that of cellular allograft rejection, which caused a pseudoaneurysm of the donor's ascending aorta in a patient who underwent combined heart-lung transplantation. Repair was performed by primary suture after mobilization of the aortic segments. On histological examination the resected aneurysm showed evidence of proliferative vasculitis with perivascular infiltration of the vasa vasorum by mononuclear cells. The mononuclear cells were identified as CD4+ and CD8+ by immunohistological staining. This report shows that cellular allograft rejection may affect the donor aorta after heart-lung transplantation and may result in pseudoaneurysm formation, even under triple-drug immunosuppression after ABO-compatible allograft transplantation.

Patients with acute massive pulmonary embolism or primary pulmonary hypertension may develop acute circulatory failure and are therefore admitted in the intensive care. The mortality rate of patients with pulmonary embolism and shock varies between 25 and 35% whereas the corresponding figure in patients with submassive embolism is less than 10%. Spiral computed tomography may be the most convenient test for diagnosing pulmonary embolism in the setting of acute circulatory failure. In the few patients who remain unstable despite adequate symptomatic treatment, transthoracic echocardiography combined with clinical judgement is appropriate. Inotropic support and thrombolytic therapy are clearly indicated for patients with massive embolism and shock. The role of the latter is more controversial in patients with right ventricular distension and normal blood pressure. The optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy for pulmonary embolism remains to be defined. Most patients are adequately treated with a six-month course of oral anticoagulants. A shorter duration may be sufficient when a transient risk factor is the cause of the initial event whereas patients with cancer or antithrombin deficiency may require a life long treatment. Primary pulmonary hypertension is a much more uncommon disease which can also lead to right ventricular failure. Symptomatic treatment combines oxygen, inotropic drugs, as well as the optimisation of right ventricular filling pressure. Specific treatment includes inhaled nitric oxide or intravenous epoprostenol followed by anticoagulants with either calcium channel blockers in patients responding acutely to vasodilators or a continuous infusion of epoprostenol in those who do not respond to acute challenge or who are not improving with calcium channel blockers. Although the long term survival has markedly improved as a result of epoprostenol treatment, some patients with refractory primary pulmonary hypertension remain candidates for lung transplantation.

Interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-4 (IL-4), two Th2-derived cytokines, are molecules with anti-inflammatory and immunodeviating properties whose direct expression in allografts may prolong graft survival. Recombinant adenoviruses represent efficient vectors for gene transfer in quiescent cells in vivo. Adenoviral vectors encoding rat IL-10 (AdIL-10), rat IL-4 (AdIL-4) or beta-galactosidase (AdlacZ) or without transgene (Addl324) were injected directly into rat hearts at the time of transplantation in order to test their potential to prolong heart allograft survival. Expression of vectorized sequences was confirmed in heart biopsies, and kinetic analysis of beta-galactosidase showed transient expression. Cardiac allograft survival was significantly prolonged after administration of 10(9) p.f.u. of AdIL-10 (16.6 +/- 3.2 days, P < 0.05), but not AdIL-4 (9.8 +/- 1.6 days), compared with Addl324-treated (9.3 +/- 3.3 days) or untreated groups (7.8 +/- 1.5 days). Immunohistochemical analysis of allografts after gene transfer of IL-10 showed that leukocyte infiltration was quantitatively equivalent to that seen in control groups but with a strong tendency towards lower levels of CD8+ cells. Importantly, adenovirus-derived IL-10 modified the functional status of leukocytes by inducing a significant decrease in IFN-gamma production but significantly increased transforming-growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) expression within the grafts compared with those treated with Addl324. These results show that expression of IL-10 by rat hearts after gene transfer mediated by an adenoviral vector decreases allogeneic immune responses and allows prolongation of allograft survival.

The proportion of patients with left-ventricular dysfunction (LVD) undergoing high risk revascularization is increasing. In this patient group, the perioperative risk is elevated because of the pre-existing pathophysiology. Detailed evaluation and interdisciplinary differential therapeutic considerations on the basis of the comparative benefit rationale, with cardiac transplantation alternative, is mandatory. Among 7275 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting between 1990 and 1998 in our institution, we found 51 patients who had had an ejection fraction <20%, and thus were candidates for transplantation (group CABG); these were compared with 163 patients who were listed for cardiac transplantation because of ischemic cardiomyopathy (group HTX). The survival analysis was performed on the basis of the intention-to-treat principle independent of subsequent transplantation. Both groups were comparable with regard to left-ventricular ejection fraction; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and serum creatinine, but patients in the CAGB group were older (63+/-11 vs 56+/-8; p = 0.001) and included a higher percentage of women (m/f: 42/9 vs 152/11; p = 0.03). Nevertheless, there was a similar 1-year survival in both groups (group BP 71.9% vs group HTX 66.3%; p = ns). Looking at the CABG group, the internal thoracic artery was used in 36/51 patients, an intra-aortic balloon pump was used preoperatively in 26 patients, and intraoperatively in 6. Left-ventricular assist devices had to be inserted in three patients, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation once. Perioperative (30 day) survival was 88.2 %. An elevated preoperative serum creatinine and the nonusage of the internal thoracic artery predicted an adverse outcome. In the long-term course, the NYHA functional class improved in most cases from III preoperatively to I after 26 (2-66) months. We conclude that patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, viable myocardium, and graftable vessels can be revascularized with acceptable risk. Since for these patients a standby of mechanical circulatory support must be anticipated perioperatively, this infrastructure should be established within the center.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated smooth muscle tumors following solid organ transplantation are extremely rare, with only 12 cases reported in the literature thus far. The exact pathogenetic role of EBV infection in the oncogenesis of these soft tissue tumors in immunodeficient patients and the biologic behavior of such tumors is still unclear. We report a 26-year-old man in whom multiple smooth muscle tumors developed 36 to 51 months after heart transplantation. All tumors, two synchronous liver nodules, two subsequently occurring paravertebral tumors, and a single tumor in a vein at the left ankle were surgically resected. The tumor tissue was processed for routine histology and immunohistochemical (IHC) stains. Additionally, competitive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR), reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), as well as in situ hybridization (ISH) were used for EBV particle quantification and gene transcription analysis. The histologic features and immunohistochemical profiles were consistent with leiomyosarcoma in all tumor nodules. EBV infection was detected in >95% of tumor cell nuclei by EBER 1/2 ISH. Competitive PCR revealed 3105 EBV particles per milligram of tumor tissue. The EBV gene expression pattern analyzed by RT-PCR and IHC corresponded to the latency type III with specific expression of EBNA1, EBNA2, LMP1, and LMP2A genes. Under continuous antiviral therapy (famcyclovir) the patient currently shows no evidence of disease. Our data indicate that EBV infection plays a causal role in the development of smooth muscle tumors following organ transplantation. A latency type III, identical to EBV-associated posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders, was identified and suggests a common pathogenetic mechanism in the development of these histogenetically distinct neoplasms. The fact that the patient currently shows no evidence of disease may be the result of the continuous administration of antiviral therapy because the soft tissue recurrences of the leiomyosarcoma occurred while the patient was not receiving antiviral prophylaxis.

The total extracellular fluid volume and distribution in plasma and interstitial spaces, and the microvascular permeability properties were studied in 16 nonedematous patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and 17 such patients who underwent heart transplantation (HT) by analyzing the 3-hour plasma disappearance curve of polyfructosan. Eighteen healthy subjects served as controls. Polyfructosan (3.5 kD) is an extracellular marker and inulin analog transported almost solely by diffusion. The initial capillary membrane plasma clearance (i.e., the permeability-surface area product), the interstitial plasma clearance determined at 10 minutes (clearance[10), and the extracellular volume were determined from the polyfructosan curves. I-131-albumin was used as a plasma volume reference. Permeability-surface area product was elevated in both patient groups (6.6 +/- 1.9 ml/ kg/min in the CHF group and 6.7 +/- 2.0 ml/kg/min in the HT group vs 5.1 +/- 1.3 ml/kg/min in controls, p <0.01 for both), whereas clearance(10) was normalized in the HT group (4.5 +/- 0.9 ml/kg/min in the HT group, 4.4 +/- 0.7 ml/kg/min in controls vs 5.0 +/- 0.9 ml/kg/ min in the CHF group, p <0.1 and p <0.05, respectively).

The results strongly suggest a microvascular permeability defect in both patient groups that perhaps plays a role in the extravascular distribution of the excess extracellular fluid volume.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether in patients with syncope and heart failure due to nonischemic cardiomyopathy, treatment with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) compared with conventional medical therapy is associated with a reduction in sudden death and total mortality. Patients with advanced heart failure who have syncope have been shown to be at high risk for sudden death. Further risk stratification has been difficult in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy in whom inducibility on electrophysiologic study is not predictive of future risk. Of 639 consecutive patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy referred for heart transplantation, 147 patients with history of syncope and no prior history of sustained ventricular tachycardia or cardiac arrest were identified. Outcomes were compared for the 25 patients managed with an ICD and 122 patients managed with conventional medical therapy. There were no differences in the baseline variables in the 2 groups of patients, including age, ejection fraction, and medical treatments for heart failure, but patients receiving an ICD were more likely to have had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (56% vs. 15%, p = 0.001). During a mean follow-up of 22 months, there were 31 deaths, 18 sudden, in patients treated with conventional therapy, whereas there were 2 deaths, none sudden, in patients treated with an ICD. An appropriate shock occurred in 40% of the ICD patients. Actuarial survival at 2 years was 84.9% with ICD therapy and 66.9% with conventional therapy (p = 0.04).

We investigated the effects of increased pressure, incubation time, and AS-ODN concentrations on transfection efficiency and toxicity. PVG (RT1c) donor hearts were heterotopically transplanted to ACI (RT1a) recipients. Donor hearts were harvested and the various groups were treated at: (1) different pressure (1-9 atm) for 45 min with 80 micromol/liter AS-ODN; (2) different incubation times (15 min to 6 hr) at 5 atm with 80 micromol/liter AS-ODN; 3) different AS-ODN concentrations (80-240 micromol/liter) at 5 atm for 45 min. Hearts were procured 24 or 72 hr after transplantation. Transfection efficiency was determined with fluorescein-labeled AS-ODN. The degree of RI was determined with biochemical and histological analysis. Increasing pressure from ambient (1 atm) pressure to pressures as high as 9 atm leads to a increase in transfection efficiency from 1.7+/-.5 to 62+/-3.9% and a reduction in RI. Increased incubation time up to 45 min increased transfection efficiency and reduced RI, but longer incubation times induced significant toxicity to the allograft. Increased AS-ODN concentrations improved transfection and reduced RI. Hyperbaric pressure is a safe and effective vector for the ex vivo delivery of AS-ICAM-1-ODN to rodent cardiac allografts and results in a reduction in reperfusion injury.

Recent and thin mural thrombi were mostly constituted of CD41a- and CD61-positive platelets; the amount of fibrin progressively increased with the increase of thrombus size. In organizing mural thrombi, gpIIb-IIIa immunostain was still present. Fibrin was the only identifiable thrombus component in old mural thrombi embedded within the intimal lesions. Recent occlusive thrombi immunoreacted both with anti-CD41a and anti-CD61 and with anti-fibrin antibodies, whereas organized occlusive thrombi with multichannel pattern exclusively immunoreacted with anti-fibrin antibodies. Double immunostain showed that mural thrombi were stratified on de-endothelized arterial segments.

We explored the role of CD45RB mAb in preventing xenograft rejection in rat-to-mouse kidney and heart transplant models. Mice with rat kidney and heart xenografts were treated with a short course of mAb, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, or mAb + cyclophosphamide combination therapy. Untreated heart and kidney xenografts served as controls. Untreated controls developed acute vascular and cellular rejection rapidly with a median survival time of only 6 days.

One-third of the kidney recipients with combination therapy survived 100 days. Immunohistochemistry and xenospecific-antibody analysis demonstrated that combination therapy remarkably reduced IgG and IgM deposition and also inhibited CD4+, CD8+, and Mac-1+ cell infiltration at early stages. This therapy, however, did not induce tolerance in this model as evoked xenoreactive antibodies and cellular responses may be the cause of late xenograft failure.

Polylysine-molossin is a 31 amino acid synthetic peptide that has previously been demonstrated to function as a DNA vector in vitro for cell lines and for the cornea. It incorporates the 15 amino acid integrin-binding domain of the venom of the American pit viper, Crotalus molossus molossus as the targeting moiety and a chain of 16 lysines as the DNA-binding moiety. The objective of this study was to evaluate several parameters of importance for in vivo applications. Binding and tissue distribution of the vector/DNA complexes were followed by a monoclonal antibody to the vector, or by the use of fluorescein-labeled DNA. Standard in vitro transfections were used to monitor effective gene transfer. (1) Optimal DNA/vector concentration. Saturation of vector/DNA binding sites on the ECV304 cell line occurred at 6 microg/ml of DNA. The concentration of vector/DNA complexes required for optimal gene transfection was found to be 2-8 microg/ml of DNA, corresponding to the concentration needed for saturation binding. (2) Optimal target cell exposure time. Vector/ DNA complexes saturated target cell binding sites within 5 min of incubation. However, lengthy exposure times (>2-3 hr) to the transfection medium were essential for substantial gene transfer. This was a consequence of two complementary factors. First, it was important that target cells be exposed to vector/DNA complexes for approximately 1 hr at 37 degrees C. Saturation of target sites at 4 degrees C and then removal of the transfection medium was much less effective. Second, exposure to chloroquine for 8-10 hr after uptake of vector/DNA complexes was essential for optimal gene transfer. (3) Inhibitory effects of serum. Exposure of complexes to even 1% serum before transfection, markedly inhibited gene transfer. However, target cells previously saturated with vector/DNA complexes and then exposed to 10% serum showed substantial gene transfer. (4) Extravasation and binding stability in vivo. Cold ex vivo perfusion of rat hearts with vector/DNA complexes demonstrated that little, if any, complex moved out of the vascular system. After transplantation of the heart, most of the complex bound to the vasculature was lost within 30 min of reestablishing the blood circulation.

Eleven (32.3%) children fully recovered, 13 (38.2%) survived with left ventricular dysfunction, and ten (29.4%) died, half of them within the first three months of follow-up. Mortality was 23.5% (8 out of 34 children) during the first year of follow-up and 29.4% (ten out of 34 children) at five years. Unfavorable prognosis was more frequently associated to: 1) clinical severity at the time of presentation; 2) lower mean left ventricular shortening fraction (10 +/- 7% in group II and 13 +/- 5% in group I); 3) occurrence of severe arrhythmia (40% in group II and 3.5% in group I). In this series a group of higher mortality risk was identified, based on some of the analyzed parameters, which should be considered as selection criteria for early heart transplantation.

Acute myopathy of intensive care has been described infrequently in children and never after organ transplantation. We report a case of acute myopathy of intensive care in a child after heart transplantation. An 11-yr-old girl, with no previous medical history, developed acute cardiomyopathy leading to cardiac shock. Family history revealed four cases of unidentified myopathy and/or cardiomyopathy. Preoperatively, while muscle biopsy was near normal, myocardial biopsy revealed non specific mitochondrial disorders. A few days after heart transplantation, she developed acute hypotonia and flaccid quadriplegia, consistent with the diagnosis of acute myopathy of intensive care. Nerve conduction studies were normal, electromyography showed myopathic changes and a new muscle biopsy from quadriceps femoris showed severe loss of myosin filaments and ATPase activity in type 2 fibres. A large laboratory screening failed to demonstrate a metabolic disease or a known myopathy. Muscle strength recovered progressively in three weeks allowing home discharge. A few months later, she was free of symptoms and muscle biopsy showed full histopathological recovery. Acute myopathy of intensive care can occur in children after heart transplantation. It should be suspected in the presence of muscle weakness and difficulty in weaning from ventilatory support. Electromyography confirmed a myogenic process and muscle biopsy allowed diagnosis. Full clinical and histopathological recovery usually occur within three weeks. ", "label": 0}{"text": "Oral findings in three different groups of immunocompromised patients.

Fifty matched healthy subjects were used as a control group. Each patient had to answer questions on medical and dental health and underwent a thorough oral, dental and serological investigation. Oral mucosal lesions were found in nearly half of all immunocompromised patients (49.6%), but in only 26% of control patients. No significant associations were found between different types of oral lesions and the underlying cause of immunosuppression.

Diffusion impairment and reduced performance in cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) have been found in patients after heart transplantation. The pathogenesis of these abnormalities is unclear. In particular, the contribution of pulmonary interstitial changes has not yet been verified. We analyzed pulmonary function tests, high-resolution CT (HRCT), echocardiography, left heart catheterization, and CPX in transplanted patients. Forty long-term survivors were studied at a median of 47 months (range, 12 to 89 months) after heart transplantation. Diffusion was impaired in 40% (transfer factor for carbon monoxide) or 82.5% (carbon monoxide transfer coefficient) of the patients. Diffusion impairment was caused by a decreased diffusing capacity of the alveolar capillary membrane in 89% and/or by a decreased blood volume of the alveolar capillaries in 46% of cases. In five patients (12.5%), CT revealed interstitial lung changes. These patients did not have different values of diffusion capacity. Maximal oxygen uptake and ventilatory efficiency during exercise (minute ventilation/carbon dioxide output slope) were impaired in 92% and 46% of the cases, respectively. Our data show that the diffusion abnormalities are caused by an impaired diffusion status of the alveolar capillary membrane. Interstitial changes detectable in HRCT were found not to be involved in this process. The reduced performance in CPX in our long-term survivors is caused by pulmonary perfusion abnormalities and low tidal volume, which is due to the deconditioning of respiratory muscle, rather than by interstitial changes or diffusion abnormalities.

Rejection reaction is an important complication in heart transplantation. Recent physiopathological findings suggest new immunosuppressive alternatives such as the use of substances that block interaction between leukocytes and endothelium or subsequent events. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of the combination of dextran 60 and conventional immunosuppressive therapy. We used Sprague-Dawley rats, both sexes, with mean weight of 317.3 +/- 31.3 g on which we carried out heterotopic heart transplantation and then randomized into four groups. All groups received cyclosporine (2 mg/kg/day) and prednisone (0.5 mg/day). Group I (n = 5) also received 0.5 cc/kg/day of dextran 60, group II (n = 5) 1.0 cc/kg/day of dextran 60, group III (n = 5) 2 cc/kg/day, and group IV (n = 4) 0.9% saline solution 0.5 cc/kg/day. The incidence and severity of rejection reaction was evaluated as survival of transplanted hearts. Significant differences were found between groups III and IV for incidence of rejection reaction (p = 0.039). However, there were no differences among groups (grade 3A or 3B) in the magnitude of the rejection reaction. Survival of hearts was better in all groups receiving dextran 60 (p = 0.031). It was concluded that dextran 60 improves survival of transplanted hearts and decreases incidence of rejection reaction.

To test the hypothesis that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) accelerates the formation of allograft vascular disease. Allograft vasculopathy, characterized by myointimal hyperplasia of the coronary arteries in the transplanted heart, is the most common cause of late graft failure and death in heart transplant recipients. The cause of the process is unclear, and no treatment exists. PDGF has been implicated in alterations in vascular endothelial biology and in vascular restenosis, but the role of PDGF in allograft vasculopathy has not been explored. An orthotopic heart transplant model was established in the rat mismatched at one class II locus using the PVGR8 and PVGR23 strains. No immunosuppressive regimen was used. Six treatment groups (PDGF-A, PDGF-A antibody, and PDGF-A receptor antibody) using 10 rats per group were examined. An untreated group of 10 rats manifesting chronic rejection as well as the native hearts were used as controls. PDGF-A at 1 ng/dL (10 rats) or 10 ng/dL (10 rats) was administered intraperitoneally to each transplant group. Similar groups were treated with PDGF-A antibody and PDGF-A receptor antibody. The animals were killed after 50 days; transplanted and native hearts were removed and coronary arteries were examined morphometrically. Smooth muscle proliferation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Statistical analysis was performed using multivariate analysis of variance. Coronary myointimal hyperplasia was seen in the chronic rejection group. The PDGF-A groups showed significant myointimal hyperplasia. Administration of PDGF-A antibody did not attenuate the process. Administration of PDGF-A receptor antibody at 1 ng/dL resulted in reduction of the hyperplasia, and 10 ng/dL significantly attenuated the process. This study establishes a cause-and-effect relation between PDGF-A and coronary myointimal hyperplasia in the rat transplant model. Blockade of the PDGF-A receptor clearly attenuates the process, indicating a potential mode of therapy to be explored.

Due to an improvement of results after heart transplantation, there is a continuously growing number of long-term surviving patients. Aimed at a characterization of established diagnostic and therapeutic protocols, the Working Group of Thoracic Organ Transplantation within the German Society of Cardiology performed a survey among all German heart transplantation centers. Based on the experience of 1,500 patients, the clinical relevance as well as approaches for prevention and treatment of rejection, infection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, malignancy, hypertension, renal insufficiency, and quality of life were assessed by a questionnaire. As a result, a time dependency of expected complications could clearly be shown. While early after HTX acute rejection and infection episodes were judged as clinically important, later on cardiac allograft vasculopathy, malignancy, and renal insufficiency predominate as relevant complications. This spectrum was reflected by a differentiated diagnostic protocol (early after HTX more frequent diagnostic procedures for rejection and infection, later intensified examinations to identify cardiac allograft vascular disease and malignancy) as well as by different intensities of immunosuppression and concomittant medication. Regarding further improvement of survival rates and quality of life, future clinical and scientific activities should be focused on the prevention of late complications after heart transplantation.

The objectives of this study were threefold: (i) assess immunogenicity of donor plasma proteins following hepatic xenotransplantation, (ii) identify potential immunogens, and (iii) consider the implications of antibody formation against these plasma proteins in xenograft survival. We studied liver and heart xenografts in a concordant combination, hamster to rat. All grafts were examined at necropsy for evidence of rat immunoglobulin G (IgG) deposition. Cardiac xenografts were placed in recipients who had, or had not, been sensitized with hamster serum. Hepatic xenografts were placed in naive recipients to see if antibodies to hamster serum proteins could be eluted from the rejecting organ. Sera of immunized rats were examined for the presence of anti-hamster antibodies by immunoelectrophoresis and by Western blotting following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) separation of hamster serum. Antibodies in sera of immunized rats were compared with those eluted from rejecting livers. Candidate antigens were identified by tandem mass spectrometry, sequence analysis, and reference to protein databases. Results showed that sera of immunized rats recognized a minimum of four different antigens in hamster serum by immunoelectrophoresis, and a minimum of seven by the more sensitive SDS-PAGE Western blot. IgG eluted from rejecting livers bound three of seven candidate antigens recognized by sera of the immunized animals. Sequence analysis searches revealed proteinase inhibitors in each of the three SDS-PAGE bands common to the above samples. All of these candidate proteinase inhibitor immunogens share a common catabolic fate, uptake via the lipoprotein-related protein (LRP/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor (CD91). Sensitization to hamster serum proteins hastened cardiac xenograft rejection in 30-50% of recipients (depending on sensitization protocol). Vascular deposition of rat IgG occurred in all rejecting xenografts. Antibody binding to proteinase inhibitors could disturb their functional activity and contribute to the pathogenesis of delayed xenograft rejection.

Despite the decreased incidence of acute rejection episodes and improvements in short and intermediate term graft survival with current immunosuppressive agents, there has been little progress in decreasing the morbidity and mortality from chronic rejection. This phenomenon may, in part, be related to the development of a humoral immune response with increases in anti-HLA antibodies, which presents as accelerated graft arteriopathy with intimal hyperplasia. Based on prior experimental work, a pilot, prospective, randomized study was performed in 23 primary cardiac transplant recipients to determine whether the addition of prophylactic photopheresis to a cyclosporine, azathioprine and prednisone regimen was safe and resulted in decreased levels of panel reactive antibodies (PRA) and transplant arteriopathy. There was no difference between the two groups in regard to infection or acute rejection incidence. The photopheresis group had a significant reduction in PRA levels at two time points within the first 6 postoperative months. Coronary artery intimal thickness was significantly reduced in the photopheresis group at 1-yr (0.23 vs. 0.49 mm, p < 0.04) and 2-yr (0.28 vs. 0.46 mm, p < 0.02) follow-up compared with the control group. In this small pilot study, photopheresis is a safe, well-tolerated immunomodulatory technique that is capable of decreasing the severity of chronic rejection manifesting as post-transplant graft intimal hyperplasia.

Patients with a preoperative serum creatinine >130 micromol/L received inotropic drugs to test for reversibility of renal dysfunction. The end point was graft failure. The average preoperative GFR of 66 +/- 17 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) declined to 52 +/- 19, 44 +/- 16, and 37 +/- 17 at 1, 5, and 9 yr after heart transplantation, respectively.

Although the decline in the pulmonary transfer factor (TL(CO)) following heart transplantation is well documented, the causes and mechanisms of this decline remain unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the relative contribution of each of TL(CO) components (the diffusing capacity of the alveolar-capillary membrane (D(M)), the pulmonary capillary blood volume (V(C)) and haemoglobin concentration) to TL(CO) reduction in heart transplant recipients. TL(CO) and its components were measured in 75 heart transplant recipients (mean age 48 years, range 19-61) between 6 weeks and 36 months after transplantation using the Roughton and Forster method and the single-breath technique. Results were compared with data from 38 heart transplant candidates (mean age 51 years, range 34-61) and 26 normal subjects (mean age 47 years, range 27-62). The mean percentage predicted TL(CO) was reduced in recipients compared to candidates (56.9 and 69.9%, respectively, P<0. 001) and both were lower than normal controls (97.7%, P<0.001). The mean percent predicted V(C) was also reduced in recipients compared to candidates (52.8% vs. 80.2 (4.2)%, P<0.001) which was also lower than normal subjects (102%, P<0.001). D(M) was equally reduced in recipients and candidates (77.7 and 81.4%, respectively, P=0.48) compared to normal subjects (100.0%, P<0.001). Correction for haemoglobin concentration increased TL(CO) in recipients to 63.5% (P<0.001), but it remained lower than haemoglobin-corrected TL(CO) in candidates (71.1%, P<0.001). In recipients, the intra-capillary resistance (1/thetaV(C)) formed 60% of the total resistance to CO transfer (1/TL(CO)) compared to 50% in candidates and normal subjects. TL(CO) decline following heart transplantation is due to an increase in the intra-capillary resistance, and this appears to be due to a combination of anaemia and reduced pulmonary capillary blood volume, with the diffusing capacity of the alveolar-capillary membrane remaining unchanged.

Intravascular ultrasound studies reveal a dual morphology with donor-transmitted and de novo plaques. Coronary vasomotor dysfunction may occur independently of morphological alterations.

Various noxious stimuli contribute to the continuing inflammatory response. Consequently, adhesion molecule expression is upregulated, leukocytes migrate into the allograft, thrombocytes accumulate, and growth factors are expressed, finally resulting in functional and morphological chronic allograft lesions. Blocking the activation of T cells, CD4+ cytokines, and adhesion molecules may prevent endothelial injury and subsequent intimal thickening. Strategies to decrease the formation of anti-endothelial and anti-HLA-DR antibodies may also be protective, as may antiproliferative drugs, augmentation of endogenous nitric oxide bioactivity, and new immunosuppressive regimens.

Orthotopic heart transplantation (HTx) results in complete cardiac denervation. Reestablished partial sympathetic nerve function has been found in patients some years after HTx. However, the atrial and ventricular regional patterns of reinnervation have not been established. Two parallel methods were used to evaluate the regional restoration of sympathetic nerves in the myocardium. Patients were investigated with respect to ventricular reinnervation (VI) using positron emission tomography (PET) and the norepinephrine analogue C-11-hydroxyephedrine (HED). Tracer uptake was quantified using dynamic imaging protocols, yielding regional HED retention fraction. A regional value above 7%/minute ( +/- 2.5 SD above the mean value of denervated hearts) was considered evidence of sympathetic reinnervation. Spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) served as a quantitative marker for reinnervation at the sinus node (SI). Spectra of HRV during positive head-up tilt were calculated. The low frequency (LF) power spectral density (0.05 to 0.18 Hz) was evaluated. After HTx (4. 6 +/- 3.9 years; range, 0.2 to 13.6 years), 38 patients (aged 50.9 +/- 7.6 years; range, 37 to 65 years) were investigated by PET imaging and HRV. Twenty-two patients with a mean HED retention of 10. 7 +/- 2.6%/minute were classified as left ventricular reinnervated. Sixteen patients with a mean HED retention of 4.8 +/- 0.8%/minute did not reach the threshold. The time difference after HTx was significant for these 2 groups, 5.3 +/- 3.0 years vs 3.8 +/- 4.7 years ( p < 0.05 ). The LF power spectral density of the ventricular reinnervated patients was 5.9 +/- 8.6 ms(2), and 1.8 +/- 4.4 ms(2) (p <0.005 ) for those not reinnervated. Low frequency showed small values and narrow distribution for the patients not reinnervated, assuming sinus node denervation, and showed extended distribution for the reinnervated, suggesting a heterogeneous reinnervation pattern. Two non-invasive parallel methods were used to investigate regional reestablishment of cardiac nerves in the myocardium in HTx patients. Left VI assessed by PET imaging and SI by HRV was congruent in 60% of HTx patients. Lack of SI paralleled absence of VI. Our results suggest that partial VI occurs prior to SI.

In Australia, despite large distances and one of the world's lowest multiorgan donor rates (11.4/million population/year), the thoracic organ transplant (TOTx) rate of 9.6/million population/year is one of the world's highest. As an example of the Australian approach, a system of transplant coordination and organ allocation has evolved at the Alfred Hospital. Donor organs are assigned locally, or between the 4 major TOTx units on rotation. The recipient team then selects appropriate recipients, matching by blood group, size, cytomegalovirus (CMV) status, prospective cross matching and clinical status. An experienced recipient coordinator takes responsibility for organization of the retrieval and transplant process, including all operating room staff, all medical personnel, and transport for the donor team and the potential TOTx recipients.

The history was reviewed to determine the presence (group 1A) or absence (group 1B) of spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias. Immunocytochemical staining for S100 protein, neurofilament protein, tyrosine hydroxylase, and protein gene product 9.5 was performed to study the distribution and the density of sympathetic nerves.

We transplanted hamster hearts into rats that had been sensitized to hamster cardiac grafts 5 days earlier as a model for discordant xenotransplantation. Sensitized rats had high serum levels of elicited anti-donor IgM and IgG that caused hyperacute rejection. Transient complement inhibition with cobra venom factor (CVF) plus daily and continuing cyclosporin A (CyA) prevented hyperacute rejection. However, grafts underwent delayed xenograft rejection (DXR). DXR involved IgG and associated Ab-dependent cell-mediated rejection, because depletion of IgG or Ab-dependent cell-mediated rejection-associated effector cells prolonged graft survival and the serum-mediated Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro. Blood exchange in combination with CVF/CyA treatment dramatically decreased the level of preexisting Abs, but DXR still occurred in association with the return of Abs. Splenectomy and cyclophosphamide acted synergistically to delay Ab return, and when combined with blood exchange/CVF/CyA facilitated long-term survival of grafts. These grafts survived in the presence of anti-donor IgM, IgG, and complement that precipitated rejection of naive hearts, indicating that accommodation (survival in the presence of anti-graft Abs and complement) had occurred. We attribute the long-term survival to the removal of preexisting anti-donor Abs and therapy that attenuated the rate of Ab return. Under such conditions, the surviving hearts showed expression in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of protective genes and an intragraft Th2 immune response. Th2 responses and protective genes are associated with resistance to IgM- and IgG-mediated, complement-dependent and -independent forms of rejection.

In the prevasodilator era, the prognosis was reportedly better in alcoholic than in IDC patients, an advantage limited to abstinent patients. No large series of patients systematically treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has since been described. We analyzed long-term outcome according to alcohol abuse in male patients with IDC. Among 338 men who had been prospectively enrolled in a multicenter registry, 79 (23%) were defined as alcohol abusers and further classified at follow-up as having stopped (AAS) or continued (AAC) abuse. AAC subjects at enrollment reported a higher daily alcohol intake than AAS subjects (178 +/- 113 vs 127 +/- 54 g/day, p = 0.012). During a mean of 59 +/- 35 months, 102 patients died and 45 underwent transplantation. Seven-year transplant-free survival was significantly lower in alcohol abusers (41%) than in patients with IDC (53%, p = 0.026), and significantly lower in AAC subjects (27%) than in either patients with IDC or AAS (45%) (p = 0. 018). Although IDC patients had beneficial changes in left ventricular function at follow-up, only AAS patients had significant improvement in ejection fraction. In this large series of patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and prospectively followed up, excessive alcohol intake was found in about one fourth of cases and persistent alcohol abuse correlated with a worse prognosis and function at follow-up.

Our aim was to compare the electron-beam CT (EBCT) features of coronary arteries in heart transplant recipients with those of biplane coronary angiography and intracoronary ultrasound (ICUS). We examined 112 heart transplant recipients (25 female; age, 17 to 69 years; median, 52 years) 1 to 153 months (median, 46 months) after surgery by EBCT to detect coronary artery calcifications. Calcifications were quantified by the Agatston scoring system. EBCT scores were compared with coronary angiography in all patients and ICUS of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in 100 patients. Coronary artery calcifications were found in 84 patients (75%). Angiographically, 16 patients displayed >50% coronary artery stenoses, all of whom had some degree of coronary artery calcification and only 1 of whom had a score of <55 (P<0.0001). With this threshold, EBCT had a sensitivity of 94%, a specificity of 79%, a positive predictive value of 43%, and a negative predictive value of 99% for detecting stenosis. ICUS confirmed the presence of calcified plaques in all patients with an LAD score >9. EBCT total calcium score was associated with the degree of intimal proliferation in that patients without ICUS features of allograft vasculopathy had a median score of 0 (25th percentile, 0; 75th percentile, 0), whereas patients with Stanford class IV vasculopathy had a median score of 41 (9 to 98, P<0.0001).

Pig-to-primate cardiac xenografts undergo hyperacute rejection (HAR), in which primate IgM bind to porcine endothelial alpha-Gal molecules and activate membrane attack complex (MAC) deposition. Prolonged graft survival can be achieved by using transgenic pig donors, which express human complement regulatory proteins (hCRP) to inhibit MAC. However, these xenografts invariably fail from delayed xenograft rejection (DXR). We sought to investigate the poorly understood DXR process. Wild-type (n = 3) and transgenic (n = 3) porcine hearts were heterotopically transplanted into baboons. Biopsies were analyzed by histology and by immunohistochemistry for porcine endothelial markers (vWF, alpha-Gal, and beta-Gal) and primate IgM and MAC deposition. Wild-type xenografts survived 60-80 min but succumbed to rapid IgM/MAC deposition and microvascular thrombosis. Transgenic xenografts avoided HAR but showed increasing IgM/MAC deposition before rejection on days 5, 7, and 11. Serum from baboons after transgenic xenograft rejection showed increased activity against porcine endothelial cells, and in vitro incubation of untransplanted porcine cardiac sections with sensitized baboon serum showed elevated microvascular IgM binding. Increased IgM deposition appeared specific to alpha-Gal, since it competes specifically with alpha-Gal-specific GS-4 lectin, but not with beta-Gal-specific RCA-1 lectin. Competition with GS-4 was not seen if na\u00efve baboon serum was used. DXR may be mediated by increasing baboon IgM binding on porcine microvascular endothelial alpha-Gal molecules.

It was recently demonstrated that classification of posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PT-LPDs) into morphological and molecular categories is clinically relevant. It was also reported that PT-LPD not associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) had a more aggressive course than most lesions associated with EBV. Because the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16/INK4a has been reported to be frequently inactivated in high-grade lymphomas, we evaluated 17 PT-LPD to determine whether p16/INK4a expression could be correlated to morphology, EBV detection, and a Ki-67 labeling index. We demonstrated that tumors with no p16/INK4a expression (n = 8) had a predominantly monomorphic appearance, and most were EBV negative (respectively, 7/8 and 5/8), whereas lesions with p16/INK4a expression (n = 9) were mostly polymorphic PT-LPD (6/9) (P = 0.049) and associated with EBV (9/9) (P = 0.015). In particular, strong p16/INK4a expression was observed in atypical immunoblasts and Reed-Sternberg-like cells. Furthermore, the proliferation index was significantly higher in tumors lacking p16/INK4a expression than in other lesions (P = 0.0008). In conclusion, down-regulation of p16/INK4a was mostly observed in PT-LPD lesions known to follow more aggressive courses: monomorphic tumors and EBV-negative PT-neoplasms. Conversely, overexpression of p16/INK4a was associated with EBV-positive PT-LPD. While p16/INK4a might play a role in the proliferative rate of LP-LPD, further investigations are needed to assess the clinical relevance of p16/INK4a expression in predicting the evolution of tumors and to explain how EBV could favor p16/INK4a protein accumulation in lesions.

Because myocardial damage determines morbidity and outcomes in heart transplant rejection, assessment of total burden of myocardial damage is highly desirable. In addition to myocyte necrosis, programmed cell death, or apoptosis, has recently been shown to contribute to cardiac allograft rejection. In the present study, we noninvasively determined myocardial damage by antimyosin scintigraphy and compared it with necrotic and apoptotic myocardial damage in endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) specimens. Forty scintigraphic and histologic studies were simultaneously performed. Of these, 19 patients had no EMB evidence of allograft rejection (group I, International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation [ISHLT] grade 0/4), 12 had mild rejection (group II, ISHLT grades 1A and 1B), and 9 had evidence of moderate allograft rejection (group III, ISHLT grades 2, 3A, and 3B). None of the biopsies demonstrated severe allograft rejection (ISHLT grade 4/4). The severity of global myocyte damage in 40 patients was assessed by antimyosin scintigraphy. Endomyocardial biopsies were performed in these patients within 48 hours of imaging study; biopsy specimens were characterized for presence of myocyte necrosis and apoptosis. Evidence of myocyte necrosis was observed in 9 (23%) of 40 EMB specimens. Nineteen EMB specimens of group I had no inflammation and no myocyte necrosis, 12 of group II specimens showed interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration (only) but no myocyte necrosis, and all 9 of group III specimens had evidence of cellular infiltration and myocyte damage. Myocyte necrosis was assessed by hematoxylin-eosin and trichrome staining of EMB specimens. On the other hand, apoptosis of myocytes, as assessed by TUNEL staining of DNA fragments, was seen in 22 (55%) of the 40 biopsy specimens: 47%, 58%, and 67% in groups I, II and III, respectively. Abnormal antimyosin scan findings, indicating presence of myocardial damage, were observed in 9 of the 19 patients in group I and in all patients in groups II and III. Although positive antimyosin scan results in group III patients are concordant with the presence of histologic myocardial necrosis, myocardial uptake of antimyosin antibodies in groups I and II (no apparent myocyte damage at light microscopic examination) could reflect either sampling error of the biopsy or ongoing apoptotic myocyte damage. Apoptosis of myocytes is frequently observed during cardiac allograft rejection. The presence of apoptotic myocytes in the absence of histologic rejection activity in patients with antimyosin uptake suggests that apoptosis could be an additional mechanism of transplant-associated myocardial damage.

Since the landmark studies of Patel and Terasaki in the late 1960s, pretransplant cross-matching has been performed by HLA laboratories on a 24-hr/7-day basis. In fact, regulating agencies such as the American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics and the United Network for Organ Sharing have mandated prospective crossmatching for selected solid organ transplants. However, two recent publications (Transplantation 1998; 66: 1833; and Transplantation 1998; 66: 1835) have suggested a change to this approach. Specifically, those authors advocate the transplantation of non-sensitized individuals without a final prospective cross-match as a means to reduce cold ischemia time and the incidence of delayed graft function. Such considerations were predicated upon results generated by cytotoxicity-based antibody screening. We and others, however, have reported that a flow cytometric-based assay is a more sensitive method to detect alloantibodies than cytotoxicity. Furthermore, an increasing number of reports document that graft survival is improved among patients whose final flow cytometric crossmatches were negative compared to patients with positive flow cytometric crossmatches. Although we agree that it is reasonable to transplant truly non-sensitized patients without a prospective final crossmatch, our data demonstrate that a large number of patients deemed non-sensitized by cytotoxicity-based antibody assessment are, in fact, sensitized. Panel-reactive antibody (PRA) testing was performed with 703 sera from 527 patients. The patient population consisted of individuals awaiting either renal or cardiac transplantation. PRA evaluations were performed using lymphocyte cytotoxicity (antiglobulin-enhanced, complement-dependent cytotoxicity [AHG-CDC]) or assays (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]; flow cytometry) in which solubilized HLA molecules were affixed to solid phase matrices. PRA activity in 264 sera from 88 patients was evaluated by AHG-CDC, ELISA, and flow cytometry. Results among the three methods were concordant for 83% of these sera. Discordant results occurred with 32 samples and demonstrated a distinct hierarchy in the sensitivity of the three techniques to detect alloantibodies. None of the 32 sera were positive by AHG-CDC, 20/32 were positive by ELISA, and 32/32 were positive by flow cytometry. Subsequent studies revealed that, among 527 patients, 302 (57%) exhibited 0% PRA by AHG-CDC. Of these 302 AHG-CDC-negative patients, 76 (25%) had class I or class II antibodies detectable using a flow cytometric approach. Within the AHG-CDC-negative/flow cytometric-positive patients, PRA values exhibited a wide range (6-99%) for both class I and class II antibodies. The average PRA was 27% and 38% for class I and II, respectively. Retrospective flow cytometric crossmatches performed for 30 recipients of cardiac allografts whose AHG-CDC PRA were 0% revealed that 11/30 crossmatches were positive. The concept of transplanting non-sensitized patients without a prospective final crossmatch is appealing and, if bona fide, clearly makes sense. However, our data demonstrate that how a patient is deemed non-sensitized is critical. The difference between AHG- and flow cytometric-based PRA testing is significant and can result in transplantation of alloimmunized patients considered to be non-sensitized. Therefore, we recommend that, if a transplant center chooses to forego a prospective final crossmatch, the decision to do so should be based on methods more sensitive than AHG-CDC.

We have previously reported that temporary treatment of cardiac allograft recipients with gallium nitrate (GN) results in indefinite graft survival, and the inability to mount donor-reactive delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses. We report that antibodies to either transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) or interleukin-10 (IL10) can uncover DTH responses to donor alloantigens in cardiac allograft acceptor mice. The DTH responses uncovered with TGFbeta-reactive antibodies can be blocked by exogenous IL10, and those uncovered with IL10-reactive antibodies can be blocked by exogenous TGFbeta. These data demonstrate that allograft acceptor mice are fully allosensitized, and poised to make donor-reactive cell-mediated immune responses. However, such responses are subverted by a donor alloantigen-dependent mechanism that involves TGFbeta and IL10, which in turn interfere with local cell-mediated immune responses.

To test the hypothesis that presence of these mutations is associated with greater toxicity of AZA in heart transplant recipients, 30 consecutive patients treated with AZA were followed up for the first month after heart transplant. Mutation of TPMT gene (mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction-based methods) was observed in four patients (A719G: n = 2; A719G plus G460: n = 2). Agranulocytosis did not occur in patients with the wild genotype. It occurred in the two patients with mutation A719G and there was a 40% drop in neutrophils in the two other patients. Discontinuation of AZA in the four mutant patients corrected for the drop. Presence of TPMT mutations is associated with a greater likelihood of agranulocytosis.

We have used delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to probe the mechanisms of drug-induced cardiac allograft acceptance in mice. DBA/2-->C57BL/6 cardiac allograft recipients treated transiently with gallium nitrate accept their grafts for >90 days and fail to display DBA/2-reactive DTH responses. These DTH responses are restored when anti-TGF-beta Abs are included at the challenge site, and cell depletion studies showed that this DTH inhibition is mediated by CD4+ cells. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that allograft acceptor mice produce no more than background levels of TGF-beta mRNA at DTH challenge sites. This suggests that DTH regulation in allograft acceptor mice may involve TGF-beta activation, rather than TGF-beta production. The protease, plasmin, can activate TGF-beta, and activated T cells can express a receptor for the plasmin-producing enzyme urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), and can also produce both uPA and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). We observed that Abs to tPA or uPA can replace anti-TGF-beta mAb for the restoration of donor-reactive DTH responses in allograft acceptor mice. Histologic analysis revealed that accepted cardiac allografts express uPA, tPA, and active TGF-beta, whereas accepted cardiac isografts express only tPA, but not uPA or activated TGF-beta. These data demonstrate that local tPA and uPA contribute to DTH regulation in allograft acceptor mice and suggest that these elements of the fibrinolytic pathway are used to control donor-reactive cell-mediated immunity in allograft acceptor mice.

Blockade of the CD28/B7 T cell costimulatory pathway prolongs allograft survival and induces tolerance in some animal models. We analyzed the efficacy of a CTLA4Ig-expressing adenovirus in preventing cardiac allorejection in rats, the mechanisms underlying heart transplant acceptance, and whether the effects of CTLA4Ig were restricted to the graft microenvironment or were systemic. CTLA4Ig gene transfer into the myocardium allowed indefinite graft survival (>100 days vs 9 +/- 1 days for controls) in 90% of cases, whereas CTLA4Ig protein injected systemically only prolonged cardiac allograft survival (by up to 22 days). CTLA4Ig could be detected in the graft and in the serum for at least 1 year after gene transfer. CTLA4Ig gene transfer induced local intragraft immunomodulation at day 5 after transplantation, as shown by decreased expression of the IL-2R and MHC II Ags; decreased levels of mRNA encoding for IFN-gamma, inducible NO synthase, and TGF-beta; and inhibited proliferative responses of graft-infiltrating cells. Systemic immune responses were also down-modulated, as shown by the suppression of Ab production against donor alloantigens and cognate Ags, up to at least 120 days after gene transfer. Alloantigenic and mitogenic proliferative responses of graft-infiltrating cells and total splenocytes were inhibited and were not reversed by IL-2. In contrast, lymph node cells and T cells purified from splenocytes showed normal proliferation. Recipients of long-term grafts treated with adenovirus coding for CTLA4Ig showed organ and donor-specific tolerance. These data show that expression of CTLA4Ig was high and long lasting after adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. This expression resulted in down-modulation of responses against cognate Ags, efficient suppression of local and systemic allograft immune responses, and ultimate induction of donor-specific tolerance.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most common viral infection in the early period after heart transplantation (HTX) and causes a significant morbidity and mortality. Although controversial, CMV is related to acute and chronic allograft rejection and to the development of graft vascular disease. It therefore plays an important role in the long-time outcome after solid organ transplantation. 45 patients received a new heart between 1.1.97 and 31.12.1998. All of them were enrolled postoperatively in three-month antiviral prophylaxis (Cymevene). Only those patients were excluded from prophylaxis who were seronegative for CMV and received hearts from seronegative donors (n = 6). The pp65 antigenaemia assay and the murex hybrid capture CMV DNA assay on peripheral blood as well as the early antigen detection in the urine were used for CMV detection and also for monitoring. A total number of 580 assays were analysed (12.9 assays/patient). 561 tests (96.7%) were negative, 19 (3.3%) were positive. For CMV testing the pp65 antigenemia assay was used in 64.1%, the murex hybrid capture CMV DNA assay in 18.4% and the urine early antigen detection in 17.4%. Three patients (6.7%) developed viraemia during the first 3 postoperative months. Two patients (4.4%) suffered from CMV infection 8 and 9 months after heart transplantation and had to be treated with antiviral agents. Three patients (6.7%) died early after transplantation, but none had a CMV infection. Prevention of CMV disease was successful with three months of antiviral CMV prophylaxis after HTX.

Primary tumors of the heart, with the exception of atrial myxomas, occur rarely; tumors metastatic to or directly invasive of the heart are far more common.

The benign tumors include rhabdomyomas, fibromas, papillary fibroelastomas, hemangiomas, pericardial cysts, lipomas, hamartomas, teratomas, mesotheliomas, and paragangliomas or pheochromocytomas. The last 3 may also be malignant. The malignant tumors consist of various sarcomas: myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, angiosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, undifferentiated sarcoma, reticulum cell sarcoma, neurofibrosarcoma, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Cardiac tumors produce a large variety of symptoms through any of 4 mechanisms. Their mass can obstruct intracardiac blood flow or interfere with valve function. Local invasion can lead to arrhythmias or pericardial effusions with tamponade. Bits of tumor can embolize, causing systemic deficits when the tumors are on the left side of the heart. Finally, the tumors may cause systemic or constitutional symptoms. Some tumors, of course, produce no symptoms and become evident as incidental findings. The most useful diagnostic tool is the echocardiogram, which in almost all cases precisely locates the tumor and defines its extent. The echocardiographic appearance may also allow quite accurate prediction of the tumor type and whether it is malignant or benign. Magnetic resonance imaging serves as the next most important test where the density of T1 and T2 images may allow tumor cell type identification. With few exceptions, these tumors require operative excision. Most benign tumors can be resected completely; a few, because of their large size, cannot be, and only tumor debulking may be possible. Heart transplantation should be considered for these patients. Many of the malignant tumors cannot be resected completely, either because of the extent of local spread and invasion or because of the frequent distant metastases. Transplantation may also be an option for those with extensive local disease.

The causes of transplant-associated coronary artery disease remain obscure, and there is no known treatment. Preservation injury of murine heterotopic vascularized cardiac isografts caused a small, albeit significant, increase in neointimal formation; preservation injury of allografts markedly increased both the incidence and severity of transplant-associated coronary artery disease. As cAMP is an important vascular homeostatic mediator the levels of which decline during organ preservation, buttressing cAMP levels solely during initial preservation both improved acute allograft function and reduced the severity of transplant-associated coronary artery disease in grafts examined 2 months later. Inhibiting the cAMP-dependent protein kinase abrogated these beneficial effects. cAMP treatment was associated with an early reduction in leukocyte infiltration and a reciprocal decrease in superoxide and increase in NO levels. These data indicate that alloantigen-independent injury to the graft, which occurs at the time of cardiac preservation, can set in motion pathological vascular events that are manifest months later.

We also sought to establish the reproducibility of breath-hold CMR in this patient population. We prospectively acquired 51 sets of echo and CMR data in 21 patients who had undergone orthotopic heart transplantation. We examined the intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of breath-hold CMR in this group and compared it with published data. We compared the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) and mass determined by echo with the CMR data. The average time between CMR and echo was 0 +/- 7 days (mean +/- SD), the time between each set of CMR-echo data acquisition was 5.1 +/- 4.1 months. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance showed good reproducibility in this population, with intraobserver percentage variability of 2.2% +/- 2.4% for EF and 3. 2% +/- 2.7% for mass, and interobserver percentage variability of 2. 4% +/- 1.9% for EF and 2.2% +/- 1.9% for mass.

However, the good reproducibility of CMR may make it a more suitable technique for long-term follow-up of an individual or of a study population.

Abnormal coronary vasomotion appears to be a common finding after heart transplantation (HTx). However, the pathophysiology and outcome of this functional disturbance remains poorly understood. Aims of the study were to determine the prevalence, predictive factors and long-term evolution of endothelial dysfunction after cardiac transplantation. The endothelium-dependent coronary vasomotion of 50 patients, who showed angiographically normal coronary arteries, were studied early (at 3 +/- 1 months) and at follow-up (16 +/- 5 months) after HTx. Endothelial function was studied by selective infusion of serial doses of acetylcholine (ACh) (10(-8), 10(-7)and 10(-6) mol/l) in the left anterior descending coronary artery. Changes in mean luminal diameter after the infusion of each dose were evaluated by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). At early study, 17 patients (34%) showed a vasoconstriction after maximal dose of ACh (-13.3 +/- 13%) indicative of endothelial dysfunction. Logistic regression analysis identified the following variables as independent predictors of early endothelial dysfunction: donor inotropic support (p = 0.004), female donor (p = 0.04) and rejection at the time of the study (p = 0.01). Forty-one patients were re-studied at follow-up. Nine of them (22%) presented endothelial dysfunction. Early endothelial dysfunction was restored in 6 patients (43%) at follow-up. The number of episodes of rejection was the only variable associated to late endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction is a common finding after cardiac transplantation. The pathogenesis of this functional disturbance appears to be donor-related and immune-mediated. The reversibility of this phenomenon observed at follow-up suggests the episodic nature of the immunologic injury.

Thirty-seven patients underwent orthotopic heart transplantation (1994 through 1998) with donor hearts qualified as having LVH by echocardiography (EC) and/or electrocardiogram (ECG). We performed univariate analysis on 18 donor and recipient risk factors for mortality. We calculated 12-month survival curves using Kaplan-Meier estimates and compared them using the log-rank test. A contemporaneous cohort of 221 patients who received optimal hearts within the same institution served as a control for survival. Median follow-up was 18 months (1 to 53). Median recipient age was 58 ye ars (25 to 75), and median donor age was 47 years (12 to 63). Median donor/recipient height and weight ratios were 1.01 (0.9 to 1.19) and 1.16 (0.77 to 2.02), respectively. Two-month survival was 86.4%, and 12-month survival was 73.0%.

A review of the histopathologic features of serial biopsies and excised grafts of 117 experimental and clinical cardiac allografts and xenografts revealed a common sequence in the development of histopathologic changes in grafts showing antibody-mediated (hyperacute and acute vascular) rejection. Based on these observations, we propose the new concept that thrombosis of cardiac veins and venules is the initial key event in antibody-mediated rejection. This is followed by the development of congestion in the subtended venules and capillaries accompanied by interfascicular and, later, intermyocyte edema. Subsequently, focal or diffuse interstitial hemorrhage affecting the subendocardium, extending sometimes to involve the inner half of the ventricular myocardium, is observed. Antibody-mediated rejection therefore appears to be analogous to incomplete venous infarction of the heart. The observed histopathology (in which venular thrombosis plays a key role) favors a thrombogenic basis for the classical features of antibody-mediated rejection, namely edema, vascular thrombi and interstitial hemorrhage. A key role for venular thrombosis would explain the non-uniform distribution of the changes and may suggest new ways of preventing antibody-mediated xenograft rejection.

Antibodies directed against galactose-alpha1,3-galactose (alphaGal) are believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of delayed xenograft rejection (DXR). This study was designed to determine whether alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase-deficient (Gal KO) mice can naturally acquire a sufficient anti-alphaGal titre to cause the delayed type rejection of alphaGal-expressing hearts. Gal KO mice of various ages were assessed for anti-alphaGal antibody levels. alphaGal-expressing hearts were transplanted heterotopically into these mice and monitored daily. Rejecting and surviving hearts were evaluated histologically. In Gal KO mice greater than 6-month-old, 64% had an anti-alphaGal antibody titre above the background level. When wild-type alphaGal-expressing hearts were transplanted into this group, 45% of grafts rejected within 5 to 13 days. Histological examination of the rejected hearts displayed marked tissue damage and an inflammatory infiltrate of predominantly macrophage/monocytes. Surviving grafts showed preserved morphology. Like humans, Gal KO mice naturally develop anti-alphaGal antibodies with age. The titre in these mice was sufficient to cause a \"delayed-type\" rejection of a significant proportion of alphaGal-expressing cardiac grafts. This model thus provides an opportunity to investigate the role of naturally acquired anti-alphaGal antibodies in the pathogenesis of DXR.

Control of early acute xenograft rejection xenoreactions in the hamster-to-Lewis rat xenotransplantation model with cyclosporine (CsA) and leflunomide subdues early T-independent xenoreactivity and uncovers a late immune response that can be controlled by CsA alone. We had attributed this acquired responsiveness to CsA to the induction of tolerance of T-independent xeno-antibody responses in the recipient and recently reported that this tolerance is species-specific. Here we have further characterized the specificity and nature of this tolerant state. Lewis rats transplanted with either hearts, skin, kidney or spleen/pancreas from Golden Syrian hamsters were treated with leflunomide (5 mg/kg/day by gavage) for 14-21 days and CsA (20 mg/kg/day by gavage) continuously from the day of transplant. Some Lewis rats received a second graft of hearts or skin from Golden Syrian hamsters (day 21-30 after first transplant), and a third heart graft from Balb/c mice (day 60 after the first transplant). Serum was harvested and the titers of xenoreactive antibodies were quantified by flow cytometry. All grafts were harvested at the end of each experiment and examined by histological and immunohistochemical methods. The combination of CsA and leflunomide was able to completely inhibit the rejection of kidney, spleen and pancreas xenografts in this hamster-to-rat xenotransplantation model. In addition, only a transient treatment with leflunomide was necessary, and long-term graft survival could subsequently be maintained by CsA alone. Histological examination of these grafts at > 80 days post-transplantation indicated minimal signs of rejection. These immediately vascularized organs induced T-independent B-cell tolerance, so that second grafts of hamster hearts and skin could be maintained with CsA alone. Under the same immunosuppressive regimen, only four out of nine Lewis rats exhibited long-term hamster skin survival, probably reflecting the increased immunogenicity of the skin compared with other vascularized grafts. Nonetheless, all rats that did not reject the hamster skin graft also did not reject the hamster heart while on CsA alone. Finally, we demonstrate that the tolerant state could be maintained for up to 30 days in the absence of xenograft. The vigorous T-independent antibody response that mediates acute xenograft rejection in the hamster-to-rat model can be tolerized by the immunosuppressive regimen of CsA and leflunomide. The lack of organ specificity for the induction of this tolerance suggests that the xenoantigens inducing tolerance may be common endothelial cell antigens. Finally, the presence of the xenograft has been previously shown to be critical for the induction of T-independent B-cell tolerance, however, the tolerant state is relatively stable and persists after the removal of the xenograft.

After a mean observation time of 87 and 13.6 months respectively, 1-year survival for patient, kidney and pancreas was 95%, 90% and 77% and 100%, 97.5% and 87.5%, respectively.

The introduction of Neoral, a new microemulsion formulation of CyA. and more recently a range of adjunctive immunosuppressants have further enhanced the efficacy and tolerability of CyA-based immunosuppression. In the first year following transplantation the major causes of morbidity and death are graft failure, acute rejection, and systemic infection. Patients with deteriorated pulmonary circulation before transplantation are at increased risk of early postoperative death. Risk factors for early acute rejection include female donor sex, young donor age, and multiple HLA-DR mismatches. The principal cause of death in the long term is graft vasculopathy which accounted for 40% of all deaths. Risk factors that have been hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of graft vasculopathy include hyperlipidemia, recipient age and gender, donor age, the number of HLA AB and DR mismatches, and CMV infection. Strategies proposed to reduce the risk of graft vasculopathy include aggressive use of lipid-lowering agents, avoidance of low CyA doses, and the use of adjunctive rapamycin or RAD therapy. Rejection surveillance therefore relies on routine serial endomyocardial biopsy. Recent research suggests that a more accurate assessment of the state of the graft can be obtained by considering the results across a number of biopsy samples obtained from different parts of the heart, rather than basing clinical judgment on the worst single result obtained. New molecular markers such as granzyme A mRNA are likely to improve the power of histology to diagnose and predict rejection. Neoral pharmacokinetics give greater bioavailability and less intrapatient variability than Sandimmune. In the keynote OLN 351 study comparing Neoral with Sandimmune in de novo heart transplant recipients, fewer Neoral patients needed antilymphocyte therapy to treat rejection, fewer female patients had rejection episodes in the Neoral group, the tolerability of the two formulations was equivalent, and there was a lower incidence of infections in the Neoral group. The clinical impact of Neoral in comparison with Sandimmune in de novo heart transplant patients has been investigated in a number of additional trials, including long-term studies, which have confirmed that Neoral is associated with: Lower CyA doses than Sandimmune. Equal or greater antirejection efficacy than Sandimmune. Comparable tolerability to Sandimmune. During the administration of intravenous CyA as an induction therapy in the days immediately following transplantation, there is evidence to suggest that a 6-hour infusion given twice daily, which mimics the pharmacokinetic profile of oral dosing, may be clinically more effective than a continuous 24-hour infusion. Milligram-for-milligram dose conversion from Sandimmune to Neoral is feasible. Following conversion, a reduction in the CyA dose may be required in the majority of patients to maintain target levels. In pediatric patients, the rate of elimination of CyA is greater and bioavailability increases with increasing age. Younger patients (less than 8 years of age) may be managed more effectively with a 3-times-daily, rather than a twice-daily dosing schedule. A number of studies have compared the clinical effects of Sandimmune and Neoral in maintenance therapy for cardiac transplant patients. As with de novo patients, these studies have found the new formulation of CyA to be associated with lower rates of acute rejection, lower therapeutic doses, and comparable tolerability. Milligram-to-milligram conversion from the old to the new CyA formulation is generally well tolerated, although in a minority of patients there is a significant increase in CyA levels. These may be associated with a transient increase in side effects which resolve on dose reduction. There is a dose-sparing effect with Neoral.

Grafted hearts were examined by a pathologist who established the degree of cardiac rejection in the four cardiac cavities. Forty cardiac rejections were diagnosed in rats and ten in guinea pigs. An asymmetric distribution of histologic lesions was observed in 34 (68%) rejected hearts with greater lesions in the auricular myocardium than in the ventricular myocardium (n=25, 50%). One (n=18) or two degrees (n=7) differentiated the severity of rejection between atria and ventricles.

Introducing immunomodulatory molecules into allografts by gene transfer may avoid the side-effects of systemic immunosuppression. vMIP-II and MC148 are two recently identified chemokine homologues encoded by human herpes virus 8 and Molluscum contagiosum, respectively, that have antagonistic activities against multiple different CC and CXC chemokine receptors. We hypothesized that introduction of these molecules into cardiac allografts may block leukocyte infiltration into the grafts and prolong survival. Vascularized and nonvascularized cardiac allografts in mice were performed and plasmid DNA encoding vMIP-II, MC148 and/or vIL-10 was transferred into the allograft at the time of transplantation. Gene transfer of either vMIP-II or MC148 into cardiac allografts markedly prolonged graft survival. Combining gene transfer of either one of these chemokine antagonists with vIL-10 gene transfer, which has a mechanistically different immunosuppressive action, further enhanced graft survival. vMIP-II and MC148 gene transfer both resulted in a marked decrease of donor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) infiltrating the grafts and inhibited alloantibody production. These results demonstrate that plasmid-mediated gene transfer of virally encoded chemokine antagonists vMIP-II and MC148 can block donor-specific lymphocyte immunity within cardiac allografts and prolong graft survival.

We have previously shown that the tolerant state in allograft recipients can be maintained and perpetuated by an \"infectious\" T cell-dependent regulatory mechanism. Hence, 1) treatment of LEW rats with RIB-5/2, a CD4 nondepleting mAb, produces indefinite survival of LBNF1 cardiac allografts; 2) donor-specific tolerance can be then transferred by spleen cells into new cohorts of test allograft recipients; and 3) putative regulatory CD4+ Th2-like cells are instrumental in this tolerance model. We now report on studies aimed at exposing mechanisms underlying the infectious tolerance pathway, with emphasis on the interactions between intragraft adenovirus-IL-4 gene transfer and systemic infusion of regulatory cells from tolerant hosts. Unlike individual treatment regimens, adjunctive therapy with adenovirus-IL-4 and suboptimal doses of regulatory spleen cells was strongly synergistic and extended donor-type test cardiac allograft survival to about 2 mo. RT-PCR-based expression of intragraft mRNA coding for IL-2 and IFN-gamma remained depressed, whereas that of IL-4 and IL-10 reciprocally increased selectively in the combined treatment group, data supported by ELISA studies. In parallel, only adjunctive treatment triggered intragraft induction of molecules with anti-oxidant (HO-1) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-xL/Bag-1) but not with pro-apoptotic (CPP-32) functions, both in the early and late posttransplant phases. Hence, systemic infusion of regulatory cells potentiates the effects of local adenovirus-IL-4 gene transfer in transplant recipients. Th2-driven up-regulation of protective molecule programs at the graft site, such as of anti-oxidant HO-1 and/or anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL and Bag-1, may contribute, at least in part, to the maintenance of the infectious tolerance pathway in transplant recipients.

CD8(+) T lymphocytes are known to inhibit the development of eosinophilia and IL-5 synthesis in models of experimental lung disease. In transplantation, the rejection of fully mismatched cardiac allografts by recipients depleted of CD8(+) T cells is characterized by the recruitment of eosinophils in the rejected organs. We show here that this intragraft eosinophilia is dependent on the production of IL-5 since hearts transplanted into IL-5-deficient recipients depleted of CD8(+) cells did not contain eosinophils. More importantly, allograft survival was significantly extended in these animals. In mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC), the presence of CD8(+) T cells in the responding cell population inhibited the secretion of IL-5. This inhibition was IFN-gamma dependent since adding neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma antibodies induced the production of IL-5. Furthermore, spleen cells isolated from IFN-gamma receptor (IFN-gammaR)-deficient mice secreted IL-5 upon allogeneic stimulation in primary MLC. In vivo, eosinophilia was observed in allografts rejected by IFN-gammaR-deficient recipients. On the contrary, grafts rejected by IFN-gammaR-deficient mice treated with neutralizing anti-IL-5 antibodies did not exhibit eosinophilic infiltration.

In advanced chronic heart failure (CHF), correlation between heart rate variability (HRV) and parameters of disease severity is still unclear. A reduced HRV has been related to left but not to right ventricular function parameters. Moreover, the prognostic role of spectral measures is not fully defined. We sought to assess HRV by using a short electrocardiographic recording in ambulatory patients with severe CHF to investigate the relation of HRV with clinical neurohormonal and hemodynamic parameters and to determine its predictive prognostic power. HRV was obtained from 5-minute electrocardiographic recordings in 75 ambulatory patients with CHF referred for heart transplantation screening. Standard frequency-domain parameters (total power, low-frequency power, and high-frequency power) were calculated. Prognostic value of these autonomic markers and their correlation with clinical and instrumental parameters were also assessed. A low low-frequency/high-frequency ratio was an independent predictor of cardiac events (P =.015). No correlation was found between New York Heart Association class and HRV, whereas significant correlations were identified between norepinephrine plasma levels, several hemodynamic parameters, and spectral measures (P < or =.03). A reduced HRV, particularly a low-frequency power reduction (P =.000), was highly related to indexes of right ventricular dysfunction. The current data indicate that spectral analysis of HRV, calculated from short electrocardiographic recordings, may represent a simple but effective means contributing to risk stratification of patients with severe CHF. Autonomic information obtained from this analysis suggests that right ventricular dysfunction may be a critical element determining autonomic imbalance in patients with severe CHF.

Acute viral myocarditis is an uncommon but potentially fatal illness in children. Patients with myocarditis may present with nonspecific symptoms or atypical findings that make diagnosis in the emergency department difficult. We describe a previously healthy 14-month-old child with difficulty breathing and a tonic-clonic seizure who was subsequently found to have ECG changes and cardiac marker elevation consistent with acute myocardial infarction. The patient was immediately transferred from our community hospital ED to our tertiary care children's hospital. Shortly after admission, the patient developed intractable nonperfusing ventricular arrhythmias necessitating extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Cardiac function did not recover, and the patient required heart transplantation before cessation of bypass. Serology and anatomic pathology confirmed coxsackievirus B myocarditis. This case illustrates (1) the nonspecific presentation of myocarditis as dyspnea and seizure, (2) the manner in which myocarditis can mimic myocardial infarction, and (3) the importance of early diagnosis in the ED and transfer to a tertiary care facility.

Although transplant vasculopathy and native atherosclerosis are clinically and pathologically different entities, the pathogenesis of both diseases exhibits some common mechanisms. Both may be regarded as responses to injury within a broadened concept of the immune system. Alloantigens (e.g. on donor endothelial cells) or autoantigens (e.g. oxydized LDL cholesterol) are presented by antigen presenting cells to the T cells of the body's immune system. With the appropriate costimulatory signal, this signal pattern generates a differentiated T cell, B cell, and inflammatory cell response whereas without the second signal, the immune cells undergo apoptosis. In case of immune cell proliferation and differentiation, a coordinated pattern of cytokine release is initiated. Monocyte-derived macrophages are also involved in this process which culminates in rolling, sticking, and diapedesis through the coronary vascular endothelium and phenotype switch of medial smooth muscle cells mediated by generation of growth-promoting cytokines. Thus, viewed within a broadened paradigm of the immune system's role both disease entities may represent different vignettes of an integrated pathophysiological response to an endothelial injury.

In this indication, mechanical assist plays an important part and has improved a lot over the last decade. The authors report their experience with the same assist device in patients with primary cardiogenic shock. Nineteen patients (9 dilated cardiomyopathies, 7 myocardial infarctions, 2 myocardities, 1 undetermined) were treated with an external mechanical ventricular assist device (Thoratec, Berkeley, U.S.). Fourteen patients received a biventricular assist and 5 had a uni-left ventricular assist device. Four of the 19 patients were completely weaned off their ventricular assist after 13, 27, 36 and 94 days, respectively. Ten patients underwent transplantation after an average of 43 days (range 8-95 days). Of the 19 patients, 7 had a portable console allowing autonomous ambulation. Five patients died under mechanical assistance (26.9%) and 3 patients died after transplantation. Three patients required temporary haemodialysis; 4 suffered embolic complications; 4 had mediastinal haemorrhages; 4 had bleeding from other sites, and 6 suffered from late tamponnade. Fourteen patients had at least one infectious episode. The authors conclude that, in patients referred for severe primary cardiogenic shock, the implantation of an external biventricular assist is a reliable option, allowing sequential weaning or being a bridge to transplantation in non-dependent patients, providing they are severely selected.

These effects result from as yet unknown mechanisms not clearly attributable to lipid lowering. We here report that low-dose simvastatin treatment inhibits excessive expression of monocyte tissue factor (TF) and reduces the persistent hypercoagulability state seen in cardiac transplant recipients. Fifteen consecutive heart transplant recipients receiving standard oral immunosuppression were newly assigned to a 10 mg daily simvastatin therapy. Levels of TF activity in both unstimulated and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells drawn from transplant recipients before and under simvastatin therapy were evaluated by one-stage clotting assay. Monocyte TF activity was found to be significantly increased in cardiac transplant recipients when compared with healthy controls. Excessive monocyte procoagulant activity was reduced in cardiac transplant recipients during simvastatin treatment. This effect occurred independently of the reduction of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. As demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, monocyte TF reduction by simvastatin, observed in 13 of the 15 transplant recipients investigated, could be ascribed to an inhibition of monocyte TF gene transcription. The reduction of monocyte TF activity during treatment with simvastatin paralleled with the normalization of elevated levels of thrombin-antithrombin complex, prothrombin fragment F1+2, and D-dimer, which are markers of thrombin and fibrin formation indicating coagulation activation after cardiac transplantation. Inhibition of monocyte TF expression and attenuation of the persistent hypercoagulable state observed in cardiac transplant recipients during treatment with simvastatin may represent an important mechanism by which HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors protect against the development of transplant coronary artery disease.

Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is the most serious long-term sequel of lung or heart-lung transplantation (H/LTX). Neutrophilia in the lower respiratory tract is a prominent feature of BOS. Because polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are capable of releasing large quantities of reactive oxygen species, we measured indicators of oxidative stress and glutathione levels representing antioxidant defense in H/LTX patients (HLTX, n=6; double-LTX, n=7; single-LTX, n=9). We analyzed 19 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from 13 non-BOS patients (nine female, four male: age 39+/-4 years) and 17 BAL samples from nine BOS patients (five female, four male: age 33+/-2 years). PMN were the predominant BAL cell population in BOS (61.7+/-7.8% vs. 12.3+/-3.4%, P<0.001). Myeloperoxidase activity in the epithelial lining fluid and oxidized methionine residues in BAL-derived proteins were elevated in BOS (8.6+/-1.6 U/ml vs. 2.2+/-0.6 U/ml, P<0.01; and 12.6+/-1.1% vs. 7.7+/-0.8%, P<0.001, respectively). In addition, the concentration of reduced glutathione in epithelial lining fluid was decreased in BOS (162.6+/-20.1 microM vs. 345.8+/-57.1 microM, P<0.01), whereas the proportion of oxidized glutathione was increased (13.9+/-2.0O% vs. 6.7+/-1.2%, P<0.001). PMN, myeloperoxidase, and oxidized methionine residues were inversely correlated, whereas reduced glutathione was positively correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (P<0.05 to P<0.001). We conclude that excessive oxidative stress and a lack of glutathione are associated with BOS after H/LTX and may play relevant roles in the development of this disorder.

To gain insight in the pathogenesis of vascular lesions in heart allograft rejection, we investigated effects of allosera reactive with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or non-MHC alloantigens on graft endothelial cells (EC) in a rat transplantation model. Anti-MHC and anti-non-MHC allosera were obtained from Brown Norway (RT.1(n)) recipients of a Lewis (RT.1(1)) or congenic LEW.1N (RT.1(n)) heart allograft respectively. Reactivity with endothelial alloantigens was studied in vitro using a series of three rat heart endothelial cell (RHEC) lines of Lewis origin. Phenotypic studies of MHC and non-MHC alloantigen expression, and adhesion molecule induction on EC were performed by immunostaining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Complement-mediated cytotoxicity of allosera was studied using a 51Cr release assay. Both anti-MHC allosera and anti-non-MHC allosera showed reactivity with all three RHEC lines. EC stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-y resulted in increased reactivity of anti-MHC but not of anti-non-MHC allosera. Anti-MHC allosera showed complement-mediated cytotoxicity for EC, which was strongly increased when cytokine-stimulated EC were used. With anti-non-MHC allosera, only minor cytotoxicity was measured, irrespective of the activation of EC. Anti-MHC and anti-non-MHC allosera from the day of rejection (days 7-8 and days 29-35, respectively) had similar subclass profiles of allospecific IgG, except for allospecific IgM, which was only detected in anti-MHC allosera. Complement-mediated cytotoxicity of anti-MHC allosera from the day of rejection was effected mainly by IgM alloantibodies, whereas, in allosera taken 4 days after rejection, a predominance of cytotoxic alloantibodies of the IgG class was observed. No indications were found that either alloantibody reactivity alone or in combination with complement activation led to EC activation processes relevant to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 or vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 induction. Our data show that, in heart allograft rejection, MHC but also non-MHC alloantigens on EC are target structures in the alloantibody response. Alloantibodies reactive with endothelial MHC, but not those reactive with non-MHC alloantigens, may significantly contribute to vasculopathy by complement-mediated cytotoxicity. Although no evidence was found that alloantibodies reactive with graft EC induce adhesion molecule expression, they may trigger other EC mechanisms relevant to graft vasculopathy.

We have demonstrated that infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb), which induces strong type 2 responses, prolongs kidney allograft survival in rats. Here, we confirm that this effect is not species-specific and address immune modulation in allospecific T-cell responses mediated by nematode infection. C57BL/6 mice were injected with Nb or phosphate-buffered saline. Four days later, mice were transplanted with BALB/c hearts and graft survival was assessed. In other experiments, Nb-infected mice were immunized with BALB/c spleen cells and allospecific T-cell responses were determined in vitro. In this study, we show that Nb prolongs cardiac allograft survival in mice. Further, spleen T cells from Nb-infected, allo-immunized mice exhibit reduced allospecific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity. In contrast, allospecific proliferation of T cells in the mixed lymphocyte reaction was not reduced by Nb, ruling out immunosuppression as the mechanism of Nb-induced allograft survival. Nb infection induced IL-4 and IL-6 and inhibited IFN-gamma production by T cells in response to allo-antigen. Furthermore, anti-IL-4 treatment reduced allospecific T-cell proliferation from Nb-infected but not control mice, indicating that type 2 allospecific T cells develop in the presence of Nb. We also double-stained T cells for CD8 and IL-4 and showed that Nb induces an 8-fold increase in Tc2 cell numbers. These results are consistent with a hypothesis that Nb mediates prolongation of allograft survival through induction of type 2 immunity, including the development of regulatory Tc2 cells, and subsequent inhibition of allospecific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity.

The effects of various preservative solutions and methods have been studied to prolong the safety period of cardiac preservation. In this study, we used cardioplegic solution (CS) during cardiac preservation and investigated how flush CS yields good preservation of isolated hearts compared with only cold immersion. Male Wistar rat hearts were arrested with 4 degrees C St. Thomas crystalloid CS. All hearts were immersed for 6 hr in a 4 degrees C Euro-Collins solution. Hearts were classified into seven groups by period and number of infusions of CS (20 ml/kg) during simple immersion of hearts. Infusion of CS during preservation was not used for group I. Infusion was performed at two hours after starting immersion for group II, at 3 hr for group III, at 4 hr for group IV, at 5 hr for group V, every hour for group VI, and every 2 hr for group VII. After preservation, the hearts were reperfused with blood using a support rat. Myocardial adenosine triphosphate was measured immediately after immersion of hearts. Biochemical examination of coronary effluents was performed at 15 min after reperfusion, and cardiac function was evaluated at 40 min after reperfusion. Myocardial specimens were subsequently taken for measurement of water content. Percentage recovery of left ventricular developed pressure and dp/dt in groups III, VI, and VII were higher than those in group I at each balloon volume, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in these groups was also significantly lower than that in group I. Levels of creatine kinase-MB and lactate in groups VI and VII after reperfusion were significantly lower than those in group I. Myocardial adenosine triphosphate was significantly better preserved in groups III, IV, VI, and VII than in group I. However, no significant difference in cardiac function or myocardial adenosine triphosphate was found among groups III, IV, VI, and VII. The use of CS during cardiac preservation is effective in preserving cardiac function and myocardial enzymes, and infusion may be sufficient if performed once-only at 3 or 4 hr from starting immersion in 6 hr storage of isolated rat hearts.

The vasodilatory responses to acetylcholine (Ach) (endothelium-dependent) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (endothelium-independent) were evaluated by skin laser-Doppler perfusion measurements in 63 clinically stable HTx rec 6 yr (range 1-13 yr) after Tx, and compared with 20 healthy controls. Ten HTx rec were also followed prospectively with three repeated measurements during the first year after Tx. Plasma von Willebrand factor, big-endothelin (b-ET), and proinflammatory cytokines were measured by enzyme immunoassays. Vascular responses to both Ach and SNP were significantly attenuated in the HTx rec compared with controls. In longitudinal testing, there was a significant reduction in endothelium-dependent vasodilation, but not independent vasodilation from 1 to 12 months after Tx. Plasma levels of vWF and b-ET, as well as levels of proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1beta, were all markedly increased in HTx rec. HTx rec responses to Ach were negatively correlated to TNF-alpha levels in plasma (r = -0.39, p < 0.01). Moreover, there was also a significant positive correlation between plasma b-ET and TNF-alpha (r = 0.34, p < 0.01). In the long-term follow-up of HTx rec, endothelial dysfunction is demonstrated by both regulation of blood flow in the skin microcirculation and by raised markers of endothelial activation in plasma.

Preoperative parameters were similar in both groups; 5 patients who underwent the standard technique and no patients who underwent bicaval procedures required permanent pacemakers (p = NS).

Major perioperative arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, asystole) appeared in 8.2% and 7.0% of standard and bicaval HTs, respectively; atrial fibrillation appeared in 13.1% and 4.6%, respectively (p = NS). At 1 month, mitral and tricuspid regurgitation rates were higher in the standard group (p = NS); at 1 year only tricuspid regurgitation was still higher (p = NS).

At multivariate analysis, interaction between preoperative Wood units and transplant type was elicited for Wood units at 1 month and for right atrial pressure at 1, 3, and 6 months. In the high resistance subgroup, the patients who underwent bicaval procedures had higher resistances at 1 month. In the low resistance subgroup, right atrial pressure was higher in patients who underwent standard techniques at 1, 3, and 6 months follow-up.

The aim of this study was to prospectively analyze 1) the time-course of total homocysteine in heart transplant recipients; 2) the effects of folate supplements and cyclosporine A on total homocysteine; 3) the relation among renal function, serum vitamin levels, and total homocysteine. Fifty-two heart transplant recipients consecutively evaluated for routine follow-up during 1998 were included in the study (mean age 54 +/- 12 years; 28% female). Among the 52 patients, 10 patients were treated with folate for the entire period of the study (Group F), while 26 patients never received folate (Group NF). The remaining 16 patients who did not take folate on a regular basis were excluded from subgroup analysis. Total homocysteine and creatinine plasma levels were assayed at entry into the study (time 0) and at the end of the study, 12 months later (time 12). Homocysteinemia increased significantly from time 0 to time 12 (p < 0.001), regardless of creatinine plasma levels (p = 0.03) and folate intake (p < 0.01). However, total homocysteine levels were lower in Group F compared to Group NF at time 0 and time 12 (p < 0.02). On multivariate analysis, time of follow-up, serum creatinine and lack of folate intake were positive independent predictors of total homocysteine.

Clinical value and costs, concerning principally the HeartMate and Novacor devices, were estimated based on reports of uncontrolled case series obtained through MEDLINE (1993 to 1999), review articles, three technology assessments and data supplied by the manufacturers. Reasonably trouble-free device function can be expected for three to four years. The principal application is as a bridge to transplantation. Rarely, the heart recovers without transplantation.

The recipient cases were 46- and 25-year-old male patients who suffered from end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy and had been listed for cardiac transplantation in the Japan Organ Transplantation Network as status I candidates. The first patient was supported by the use of a paracorporeal air-driven left ventricular assist device of the NCVC type, and had a moderate degree of renal and hepatic dysfunction at the time of transplantation.

The operation was performed by the standard technique (Lower-Shumway) in the first patient and by the bicaval anastomosis technique in the second patient. Reperfusion of the transplanted heart was performed retrogradely through the coronary sinus utilizing leukocyte-depleted blood with a gradual increase in temperature. Total ischemic time was 3 h 34 min and 3 h 35 min, respectively. Weaning from the cardiopulmonary bypass was easy and uneventful in each patient.

Dendritic cells (DC) are considered to be the major cell type responsible for induction of primary immune responses. While they have been shown to play a critical role in eliciting allosensitization via the direct pathway, there is evidence that maturational and/or activational heterogeneity between DC in different donor organs may be crucial to allograft outcome. Despite such an important perceived role for DC, no accurate estimates of their number in commonly transplanted organs have been reported. Therefore, leukocytes and DC were visualized and enumerated in cryostat sections of normal mouse (C57BL/10, B10.BR, C3H) liver, heart, kidney and pancreas by immunohistochemistry (CD45 and MHC class II staining, respectively). Total immunopositive cell number and MHC class II+ cell density (C57BL/10 mice only) were estimated using established morphometric techniques--the fractionator and disector principles, respectively. Liver contained considerably more leukocytes (approximately 5-20 x 10(6)) and DC (approximately 1-3 x 10(6)) than the other organs examined (pancreas: approximately 0.6 x 10(6) and approximately 0.35 x 10(6); heart: approximately 0.8 x 10(6) and approximately 0.4 x 10(6); kidney approximately 1.2 x 10(6) and 0.65 x 10(6), respectively).

Therefore, quantifying donor-derived soluble counterparts of HLA Class I (sHLA-I) in the plasma of the recipient may offer a new possibility for non-invasive monitoring of rejection after organ transplantation. In an extended study with 34 heart transplant recipients, we used sHLA-I specific ELISAs to monitor donor-derived soluble sHLA-A2, -A3, -A9, -B7, -B12 and B51. The assays were sensitive enough to detect dsHLA Class I in plasma of the recipients. However, the levels of sHLA were not found to be a useful tool for monitoring rejection. Rejection was often associated with low levels of donor sHLA. The recent finding that antibodies can inhibit the detection of sHLA molecules might explain this discrepancy. In order to test this hypothesis, patient sera were screened for the presence of anti-HLA antibodies and the results were related to the donor-derived sHLA levels. Only in four out of 34 patients HLA Class I specific antibodies could explain the low sHLA levels during rejection. In heart transplantation increased donor-derived sHLA levels are not a suitable marker for rejection and that antibody formation can not explain these results. Therefore, monitoring rejection episodes on the basis of donor-derived soluble HLA molecules is not a realistic approach to decrease the number of biopsies after heart transplantation.

The assumption has been that the immune response to such organs is initiated in the graft itself when recipient lymphocytes encounter foreign histocompatibility antigens presented by the graft's endothelial cells. In contrast to this view, we show here that cardiac allografts are accepted indefinitely in recipient mice that lack secondary lymphoid tissue, indicating that the alloimmune response to a vascularized organ transplant cannot be initiated in the graft itself. Moreover, we demonstrate that the permanent acceptance of these grafts is not due to tolerance but is because of immunologic 'ignorance'.

A better understanding of altered expression of myocardial beta-adrenoceptors can facilitate the diagnosis of early and late acute rejection of heart transplants. We submitted rats to heterotopic heart transplantation (iso- and allografts) of which one of each were treated with or without cyclosporin A for 4, 7, and 14 days (n=5, respectively). The cardiac sections were incubated in vitro with [3H]CGP 12177, or the hearts were labeled in vivo by intravenous injection of [3H]CGP 12177. Autoradiographic images of both were analyzed digitally and compared with histologic findings. Beta-adrenoceptor distribution in native hearts and isografts was homogeneous, but highly differential distribution and density in allografts were observed in the left and right ventricular walls and in the interventricular septum despite treatment with cyclosporin A. High-density areas in the progressive course of acute rejection are commonly associated with up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors in apparently viable myocytes, although histologic findings confirmed many infiltrating mononuclear cells. Low-density areas, which were identified in the right and left ventricular walls as early as 4 days after transplantation, correlated with derangement of myocytes, which was suggestive of early acute rejection. The images obtained by in vivo technique were comparable to in vitro images. The alteration of beta-adrenoceptor expression in allografts showed a close relationship with the severity of acute rejection, and the techniques employed in this model were useful in our study of the rejection process and in detecting early and late acute rejection in the rat.

Cyclosporine (CsA) nephrotoxicity is a common problem after cardiac transplantation. We have studied the impact of CsA dose reduction in association with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) treatment on renal function in heart transplant recipients with suspected CsA nephrotoxicity (serum creatinine level >2 mg/dl). Twelve heart transplant recipients (11 men, 1 woman; 111 to 1813 days after transplantation) with CsA-based immunosuppression (plus azathioprine and/or steroids) and a serum creatinine level >2.0 mg/dl were started on a daily dose of 2000 mg of MMF. Dilated cardiomyopathy was the underlying disease in nine patients, ischemic cardiomyopathy in three patients. Mean patient age was 57 years (range 44-69 years). Azathioprine was discontinued and CsA slowly tapered. Creatinine clearance, serum creatinine level, urea nitrogen, and uric acid were monitored. CsA levels were measured, and CsA dose was adjusted for whole blood levels of 70-120 microg/L. Ten patients still had endomyocardial biopsies, whereas one had echocardiographic controls only. One grade 1B rejection episode according to ISHLT (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation) was observed until 1 year after the switch to MMF. One patient was excluded due to gastrointestinal side effects. Conversion from azathioprine to MMF with consecutive reduction of CsA in heart transplant recipients with CsA-impaired renal function improves renal function as evidenced by lower serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, uric acid, and higher creatinine clearance.

Alpha- and beta-CM autoantibody (IgG and IgM) levels were similar in DCM and IHD patients but were statistically higher than in controls. Distribution of preformed (beta-CM) IgM-Abs in patients with and without rejection in the first postoperative year differed in the two groups. DCM patients rejected earlier P=0.006, and the frequency of rejection at 3 months was statistically higher than in IHD patients. Frequency and reactivity of IgM-Abs in DCM patients with rejection [International Society for Heart and Lung Transplant (ISHLT) grade I and above] was 28% compared with 7% in rejection-free patients, P<0.05. IgM-positive patients had a greater frequency and severity of rejection episodes and required more immunosuppression. These patients had rejection earlier than Ab-negative patients, P<0.009. There was no correlation between antibody status and rejection in IHD patients or with IgG in either group. Distribution of IgG subclass differed in the two diseases. DCM patients had significantly higher IgG3 reactivity; 70% of this activity was present in patients who developed moderate rejection. IgG3-positive patients experienced more frequent rejections, as well as a greater incidence of grade 3A/B rejection as the first episode, than did Ab-negative patients (50% vs. 15%), P<0.05.

Pretransplant blood transfusions have beneficial effects on both clinical and experimental allograft survival. In the present study, we examined whether pretransplant hamster blood transfusions (pHBT) alone or together with peritransfusion immunosuppressive strategies designed to target B cells and/or natural killer (NK) cells, could modulate T cell-independent (T-I) xenoreactivity in athymic nude rats. Hamster or mouse hearts were heterotopically xenotransplanted into untreated or treated athymic nude rats receiving either pHBT, anti-B cell or anti-NK cell therapy alone or their combinations. Xenoreactive antibodies (xAbs) and the percentage of NK cells were analyzed by FACScan analysis. NK cytotoxicity was measured by a standard 4 hr 51Cr release assay. Xenografts (Xgs) were examined by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), by light microscopic method with Masson's trichrome and orcein staining, by immunofluorescent staining for immunoglobulin M and C3 deposition, and by immunohistochemical staining for infiltration of NK cells and macrophages (Mphis). In 1 of 6 rats given pHBT alone 2 weeks before receiving hamster xenografts, Xg survival was prolonged to 55 days compared with 3.0+/-1.2 days in the other 5 animals and with 3.0+/-0.6 days in untreated animals. In the 55 days, surviving Xg infiltration of Mphis and NK cells was seen together with severe signs of chronic rejection, such as fibrosis and obliterative vasculopathy. The addition of the anti-B cell immunosuppressant MNA715 (malononitriloamide x920715, 20 mg/kg/day) from day -14 to day +14 or of 100 microL of rabbit anti-asialo GM1 serum ([anti-ASGM1] an NK cell depleting antibody) on day -14 resulted in a significant and species-specific prolongation of the survival of hamster Xgs, respectively 59.8+/-9.6 days and 58.2+/-14.7 days (P<0.001 vs. control group), but not of mouse heart Xgs that were rejected in a normal tempo. All prolonged hamster Xgs were infiltrated with Mphis and NK cells and developed severe lesions of chronic rejection, such as fibrosis and obliterative vasculopathy. In contrast, MNA715 or anti-ASGM1 alone had no effect on Xg survival (4.8+/-1.7 days and 2.7+/-0.6 days, respectively). Combined MNA715/anti-ASGM1 treatment only moderately promoted Xg survival (10+/-5.0 days; P<0.001). A simultaneous administration of pHBT, MNA715, and anti-ASGM1 induced indefinite and species-specific Xg survival in all recipients. In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that both T-I B cell and NK cell species-specific xenotolerance were achieved. Pretransplant blood transfusion may have a species-specific immunomodulatory effect on T-I xenoreactivity. This effect is further enhanced by a temporary co-administration of MNA715 or by a single injection of anti-ASGM1.

Using the fully mismatched mouse cervical heart transplant model, BALB/c (H2d) to CBA (H2k), the experimental groups were (i) no therapy, (ii) tacrolimus (1 mg/kg, i.p., daily, days 0-14); (iii) cyclosporine (25 mg/kg, i.p., daily, days 0-14), (iv) blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to CD4 and CD8 (2 mg, i.p., starting day 0 and on alternating days thereafter for a total of six doses), (v) tacrolimus plus mAbs, and (vi) cyclosporine plus mAbs. Allograft survival was prolonged in both the tacrolimus and cyclosporine groups. mAbs alone induced tolerance, and mAbs combined with tacrolimus also induced tolerance.

However, there is no report evaluating their expression in cardiac allografts in human or non-human primates. Heterotopic cardiac transplantation was performed on Japanese monkeys. Subjects were treated with chimeric anti-human lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 monoclonal antibody for 2 weeks. Heart grafts were harvested at days 1-95 (n = 7). Native monkey hearts were used as controls (n = 2). We examined expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 using immunohistochemistry and in situ reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In the myocardium, the expression of MMP-2 was increased in the spindle-shaped cells of acutely rejected myocardial interstitium and prior to the presence of mononuclear cell infiltration at days 1-41. TIMP-1 and 2 expression was enhanced in association with the progression of fibrosis at days 40-95. In the coronary arteries of chronically rejected allografts, enhanced MMP and decreased TIMP expression was observed in both thickened intima and media at days 40-95. The medial MMP mRNA expression was observed before the development of intimal thickening occurred at days 7-28. MMPs are critical for the progression of acute and chronic rejection, and TIMP predominance plays important roles in fibrosis in association with acute rejection.

We therefore studied the interactions between tumor growth and graft rejection, especially with regard to chemotherapy, using a combined tumor/transplantation model. As a tumor model, we used the Novikoff hepatoma, a malignant hepatoma that was injected subcutaneously into the backs of rats. Heterotopic heart grafting served as the transplantation model. In a first step (a), we studied the effect of cytostatic therapy on tumor growth: tumor cells were injected, and in four groups epirubicin, cyclosporine, epirubicin + cyclosporine, and placebo were applied, in corresponding groups, transplantation was additionally performed. Tumor growth was measured and the resected tumors were examined by histology and immunohistology. In a second step (b), we studied the effect of chemotherapy on graft rejection: transplantation was performed and the above-mentioned drugs were applied; in corresponding groups, a solid tumor was additionally induced and resected immediately before transplantation. The results of these procedures were as follows: (a) Epirubicin decreased tumor growth and diminished the volume-increasing effect of cyclosporine significantly. After transplantation, tumor growth was similar. (b) Epirubicin prolonged graft survival significantly, and the combination with cyclosporine had an augmenting effect. In the corresponding groups, graft survival was similar. In conclusions. chemotherapy diminishes the tumor-increasing effect of cyclosporine and does not interfere negatively with graft survival.

Despite the fact that Penn State's 70 cc pneumatic ventricular assist device has been used with a success rate of over 90% in more than 250 patients worldwide, efforts to scale down the pump have encountered difficulties. Animal experiments with a 15 cc version were unsuccessful, with explanted pumps showing extensive thrombus deposition within the pumping chamber. The materials used to fabricate the smaller pump as well as the basic operating principles are identical to the successful adult-sized version. It is therefore believed that reducing the size of the pump altered the internal flow field, and that fluid dynamic factors were responsible for the high degree of thrombus observed with the implanted devices. A dimensional analysis was conducted that revealed significant differences in both Reynolds (Re) and Strouhal (St) numbers between the successful and unsuccessful pumps. Two component laser Doppler velocimetry was then used to characterize the internal flow field quantitatively.

Endomyocardial biopsy is generally used to quantify cardiac allograft rejection and guide immunotherapy. While non-invasive techniques have been investigated, none of these has demonstrated sufficient sensitivity or specificity to replace myocardial biopsy. Twelve cardiac transplant recipients were assessed over a 1 year period using limiting dilution analysis, to determine the frequency of HTLp in response to cadaver donor splenocytes. The IL-2-dependent mouse cell line CTLL-2 was used to measure the IL-2 present and the precursor frequency was calculated using maximum likelihood estimation. In the months immediately post transplantation, six of the 12 recipients displayed an association with increases in HTLp frequency, which preceded histologically detectable rejection. The second six recipients had fewer rejection episodes and achieved 'acceptance' of their graft sooner. Once 'acceptance' was achieved, the association between IL-2 HTLp frequency and rejection was no longer apparent.

Sinus node sympathetic reinnervation was determined by heart rate (HR) change after tyramine injection into the artery that perfused the sinus node. HR changes of <5 and > or =15 bpm were defined, respectively, as denervation and marked reinnervation. During treadmill exercise, HR, blood pressure, and expired O(2) and CO(2) were measured.

Two years after the transplantation, a continuous murmur occurred at the left sternal edge after repeated endomyocardial biopsies. Echocardiography and coronary angiography revealed a dilated left anterior descending artery with a fistula to the right ventricle. The circumflex was large with an equally postero-lateral branch, and the right coronary artery was rather small with collaterals to the distal part of the left anterior descending branch. The patient had refused any intervention to close the fistula. The left ventricular levogram was normal. Two years later, in a follow-up angiogram, the left ventricular ejection fraction had decreased as a result of hypo- and akinesis of the apex and posterior wall. We suggest that this local wall motion disturbance derives from a steal phenomenon rather than being a sequela of rejection. The decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction was associated with shortness of breath upon moderate exercise. Standard heart failure medication relieved the patient's symptoms.

The impact of acute rejection, immunosuppression, and infection, specifically cytomegalovirus infection, on the development of chronic rejection in the cardiac allograft, has been the subject of a large number of investigations. One of the difficulties in finding associations has been the marked immunologic heterogeneity of the patient population coupled with the lack of the ability to HLA match. Furthermore, the ideal animal model, which duplicates as well as controls for this immunologic heterogeneity, is lacking. To try to simulate differences in HLA matching, immunosuppression regiments and cytomegalovirus infection, heterotopic heart transplantation was performed in two separate, complete MHC mismatch, rat strain combinations (WF-LEW, BN-LEW) requiring chronic immunosuppression and employing four separate immunosuppression/infection protocols. Animals were followed for 6 months, killed, and rejection and vascular changes were scored blinded to the group. The mean vascular and acute rejection scores were not significantly different between treatment regiments for either specific strain combination. There was a trend for the subtherapeutic groups to have higher vascular scores. Overall, there were no significant differences in vascular scores between the WF-LEW and BN-LEW groups (1.25+/-0.18 vs. 1.13+/-0.20, P=NS).

The efficacy of two synthetic major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-derived DA (RT1.Aa) 25-mer peptides (residues 56-80 and 96-120) to modulate alloreactivity was tested in Lewis (RT1.A1) responder animals. The DA peptide 56-80, but not peptide 96-120, induced delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). DTH was significantly reduced by oral feeding of peptide 56-80, P = 0.004. In addition, oral feeding of this peptide in combination with a short course of cyclosporin A (CsA) prolonged graft survival of 60% of heterotope transplanted DA cardiac allografts in Lewis recipient rats. Long-term survivors developed low levels of allo-antibodies against donor tissue as compared to rejecting animals and increased levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4) within the allograft. Similarly, IL-4-secreting splenocytes were identified by flow cytometry in these animals, indicating a Th2-type cytokine pattern. However, graft survival was particularly limited to cardiac allografts because donor-type skin grafts were acutely rejected in tolerant animals. It is interesting that residue alignment of peptide 56-80 to the motif of the RT1.A1 molecule showed a preferred class I motif within this sequence, suggesting indirect presentation of this peptide to recipient T cells. Thus, peptide 56-80 appears to represent a dominant epitope that can be exploited for establishing tolerance in this transplantation strain combination.

To compare hemodynamics and plasma big endothelin levels in patients awaiting heart transplantation who are receiving continuous IV therapy, and to establish their respective potency for predicting future cardiac events. A randomized, prospective trial of ambulatory continuous treatment with IV prostaglandin E(1) (PGE(1)) vs dobutamine. A subanalysis was conducted of all patients who completed 4 weeks of follow-up in regard to treatment effects on hemodynamics and big endothelin plasma levels. Thirty-two listed heart transplant candidates who were refractory to oral treatment, 21 patients who were receiving PGE(1), and 11 patients receiving dobutamine. Hemodynamics and plasma big endothelin levels were measured at baseline and after 4 weeks. The cardiac index increased significantly (PGE(1) group, 1.7 +/- 0.4 vs 2.5 +/- 0.6 L/min/m(2); dobutamine group, 1.8 +/- 0.3 vs 2.3 +/- 0.6 L/min/m(2); p < 0.05), whereas the systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) decreased significantly only in the PGE(1) group (3,352 +/- 954 vs 2,178 +/- 519 dyne. s. cm(-5)/m(2); p < 0. 05). The plasma big endothelin level decreased significantly (PGE(1) group, 7.6 +/- 3.1 vs 4.7 +/- 2.6 fmol/mL; dobutamine group, 6.5 +/- 3.7 vs 5.0 +/- 2.6 fmol/mL; p < 0.01 for the time effect).

Continuous treatment over 4 weeks with either PGE(1) or dobutamine in patients awaiting heart transplantation yields an improved hemodynamic state accompanied by a reduction of increased big endothelin levels. Plasma big endothelin measured after 4 weeks of continuous therapy provides prognostic information about future outcome.

Coronary disease of the transplanted heart is the principal cause limiting long-term survival of patients and grafts. In view of the invasive nature of coronary angiography, dobutamine echocardiography has been proposed as a non-invasive diagnostic method for this disease. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and reliability of this investigation in transplanted children. Twenty-one echoes were performed with dobutamine infusions in 17 patients transplanted at 10 months to 16.9 years of age (average 8.4 years), and followed up 1.1 to 10.1 years (average 4.4 years): 4 were on antihypertensive drugs but none were treated by betablockers. Dobutamine echocardiography was performed according to the standard protocol used in adults. The maximal level was attained in all cases. No major side effects were observed. The maximal heart rate attained 57 to 89% of the theoretical maximal rate, an increase of 44 to 184% compared with the basal heart rate. The maximal systolic blood pressure rose to 120 to 194 mmHg, an increase of 8 to 109% compared with resting values. The contractility scores and segmental contractile index were normal in 18 cases, abnormal at the maximal level in 2 cases (hypokinesia of segments 8 and 9 and akinesia of segments 10 and 16 with an index of 1.2), abnormal at the lowest levels (hypokinesia of segment 7 with an index of 1.1) and maximal level (hypokinesia of segments 1 and 7 with an index of 1.2) in one case. These results were concordant with coronary angiography performed within 2 to 8 days of echocardiography, and considered as the diagnostic investigation of reference (sensitivity 75%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100% and negative predictive value 93%). The authors conclude that dobutamine echocardiography is a non-invasive method easily performed with low risk in transplanted children but its diagnostic performance in coronary disease of the transplanted heart should be confirmed in larger studies.

Although evaluation of heart transplant candidates and recipients is usually based on objective clinical variables, self-assessment has been proved to be an important component of treatment evaluation. Quality of life is a multidimensional concept, a mix of objective and subjective measures, that could reflect the adjustment to the illness and its treatment. Few studies have reported on quality of life in heart transplantation candidates. This exploratory study, conducted in Bordeaux (France), was designed to assess both objectively and subjectively the quality of life in heart transplant candidates and recipients and to determine the relationships between subjective and objective variables. The assessment was cross-sectional; 21 candidates evaluated at an average of 10 (Sd 21.4) months into the waiting period, were matched with 21 recipients at 29.5 months post operative. Subjective evaluation of the quality of life was self-assessed by the Tableau d'\u00e9valuation assist\u00e9e de la qualit\u00e9 de la vie (TEAQV) and the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). A semi structured psychiatric interview, and the NYHA (New York Heart Association) cardiac insufficiency score provided objective measurements. The NHP and TEAQV mean scores were not not significantly different between the two groups: candidates (C) and recipients (R) reported similar subjective data regarding positive quality of life experience. The objective data indicated significant disadvantages for the candidate group: the cardiac insufficiency score was worse in the candidates [(NYHA mean score: (C) = 2.7 Sd 0.56 vs (R) = 0.7 Sd 0.8, t de Student p < 0.01)] and the DSM III-R axis 1 diagnoses were more frequent in the candidates [(C) = 16/21 vs (R) = 9/21 Chi2 p < 0.05)]. There was a prevalence of adjustment disorders in the candidates. Significant correlations were found between NYHA and NHP mean scores (r = 0.6, p < 0.01) and NYHA and physical and psychological dimensions of the TEAQV (r = -0.65 and r = -0.55, p < 0.01) in the recipient group. In the candidate group, no correlation was found between these scores. In the recipient group, objective and subjective assessment showed greater concordance than in the candidate group. Despite more objective physical and moderate yet frequent psychiatric complications, the candidate group reported as positively as did the recipients upon the quality of their life experience. This could be the result of psychological adaptation to the stressful situation. These data were in accordance to several earlier reports. However, the literature has remained controversial upon the evaluation of the quality of life of the candidates. The results of this study, limited by some methodological bias (the small number of patients assessed), need to be confirmed in a prospective study.

(5 mg/kg twice a day) but only 46.5% (95% CI 45-47.5%) when given orally (1 g three times a day) whereas the corresponding figures for a typical GCV-resistant virus are 62% (95% CI 57-66%) and 35% (95% CI 33-37%), respectively. During prolonged periods of GCV therapy we show that the apparent sudden appearance of GCV resistance is explained by the combination of two exponentially increasing populations (wild type and mutant) at doses of GCV that do not completely inhibit CMV replication. Cell culture methods to assess CMV drug resistance in vivo will underestimate its prevalence because of the fitness loss of resistant virus in the absence of therapy. The parameters determined from these models then were used to predict the likely viral load and resistance patterns in patients on prolonged therapy with GCV. The modeled and experimental data showed excellent agreement over extended time periods (up to 270 days of therapy) and provide a framework to predict the virologic course of patients at therapeutic initiation.

Procedural results, results of angiography 4Eth 6 months after intervention, and clinical follow-up were recorded. Nineteen patients underwent 51 interventions. Thirty-eight lesions (75%) were de novo and 13 (25%) were restenotic.

Donor-specific allograft tolerance can be induced in the adult rat by pregraft donor-specific blood transfusion (DST). This tolerance appeared to be mediated by regulatory cells and to the production of the suppressive cytokine TGF-beta1. A potential immunoregulatory CD8+ clone bearing a Vbeta18-Dbeta1-Jbeta2.7 TCR gene rearrangement was previously identified in DST-treated recipients. To assess the functional role of this T cell clone in the induction of tolerance by DST, we have vaccinated DST-treated recipients with a plasmid construct encoding for the Vbeta18-Dbeta1-Jbeta2.7 TCR beta-chain. DST-induced allograft tolerance was abolished by anti-TCR Vbeta18-Dbeta1-Jbeta2.7 DNA vaccination in six of seven recipients, whereas vaccination with the vector alone, or with the construct encoding a TCR Vbeta13 beta-chain, had no effect. However, the transcript number of the Vbeta18-Dbeta1-Jbeta2.7 chain was unchanged in allografts from vaccinated DST-treated rats, suggesting that this clone was not depleted by vaccination, but rather was altered in its function. Moreover, TCR Vbeta18-Dbeta1-Jbeta2.7 DNA vaccination restored the anti-donor alloantibody production, partially restore the capacity of spleen cells from tolerized recipients to proliferate in vitro against donor cells, and decreased the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1, seen in DST-treated recipients, in spleen cells from vaccinated DST-treated ones. This study strongly suggests that this CD8+ TCR Vbeta18-Dbeta1-Jbeta2.7 T cell clone has an effective immunoregulatory function in allograft tolerance induced by DST.

Flt3 ligand (FL) is a potent hemopoietic growth factor that strikingly enhances stem cells and dendritic cells (DC) in vivo. We examined the impact of infusing FL-mobilized bone marrow (BM) cells on microchimerism and anti-donor reactivity in normal and tacrolimus-immunosuppressed, noncytoablated allogeneic recipients. BM from B10 (H2b) mice given FL (10 microg/day; days 0-8; FL-BM) contained a 7-fold higher incidence of potentially tolerogenic immature CD11c+ DC (CD40low, CD80low, CD86low, MHC IIlow) that induced alloantigen-specific T cell hyporesponsiveness in vitro. C3H (H2k) mice received 50 x 106 normal or FL-BM cells (day 0) and tacrolimus (2 mg/kg/day; days 0-12). On day 15, enhanced numbers of donor (IAb+) cells were detected in the thymi and spleens of FL-BM recipients. Tacrolimus markedly enhanced microchimerism, which declined as a function of time. Ex vivo splenocyte proliferative and CTL responses and Th1 cytokine (IFN-gamma) production in response to donor alloantigens were augmented by FL-BM infusion, but reduced by tacrolimus. Systemic infusion of purified FL-BM immature DC, equivalent in number to that in corresponding whole BM, confirmed their capacity to sensitize, rather than tolerize, recipient T cells in vivo. In vitro, tacrolimus suppressed GM-CSF-stimulated growth of myeloid DC from normal BM much more effectively than from FL-BM without affecting MHC class II or costimulatory molecule expression. Infusion of normal B10 BM cells at the time of transplant prolonged C3H heart allograft survival, whereas FL-BM cells did not. A therapeutic effect of tacrolimus on graft survival was observed in combination with normal, but not FL-BM cells. These findings suggest the need for alternative immunosuppressive strategies to calcineurin inhibition to enable the engraftment, survival, and immunomodulatory function of FL-enhanced, immature donor DC.

Aggressive development of allograft coronary artery disease is a major cause of death in heart transplant recipients. Percutaneous balloon angioplasty is considered suboptimal for complex lesions in native coronary vessels and heart transplant recipients, alike. Excimer laser energy (308-nm wavelength) can successfully remove and vaporize atherosclerotic plaques in native coronary vessels; however, its application in heart transplant recipients has not been studied clinically yet. Six heart transplant recipients underwent percutaneous excimer laser (CVX-300, Spectranetics, Colorado Springs, CO) coronary angioplasty for treatment of a total of 10 discrete, obstructive coronary artery lesions. By using concentric or eccentric multifiber laser catheters, energy parameters were set at a fluence of 45 mJ/mm(2) or 60 mJ/mm(2) with a frequency of 25 Hz and 40 Hz, respectively, with a pulse duration of 135 ns and output of 200 mJ/pulse. The \"saline flush\" and \"pulse and retreat\" lasing techniques were used. In each case, adjunct balloon angioplasty was performed; in five lesions, an intracoronary stent was implanted. Angiographic evaluation was performed by visual assessment. Each procedure was successful as defined by laser recanalization of the target lesion (reduction of target lesion stenosis in more than 20%) and subsequent adequate final luminal patency (reduction of target lesion stenosis to less than 50%) and absence of any major in-cardiac catheterization complication (such as perforation, acute closure, dissection, emergency coronary artery bypass surgery), or in-hospital complications (such as death, myocardial infarction, cardiac enzyme elevation, major bleeding), or need for surgical revascularization. A 92 +/- 5% preprocedural percent diameter stenosis was reduced by laser to 35 +/- 16% and by adjunct balloon angioplasty in all lesions and stenting in five lesions, to final residual stenosis of 2 +/- 6%. Angiographic follow-up between 2 and 6 months after the procedure demonstrated a target lesion restenosis rate of 22%. Percutaneous excimer laser is safe and efficacious in the treatment of focal obstructive lesions caused by allograft coronary artery disease. These data represent an early clinical experience; thus, the long-term outcome of this revascularization method in recipients of heart transplantation will have to be determined by a large scale prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical study.

Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is an Epstein-Barr virus-associated B-cell lymphoproliferative disease. It is angiocentric and angiodestructive and involves the lungs, central nervous system and skin. Exclusive cutaneous involvement is rare and may be associated with a better outcome. Contrarily to the extra-cutaneous forms of lymphomatoid granulomatosis, it is difficult or impossible to detect Epstein-Barr virus DNA sequences in primary and isolated cutaneous lymphomatoid granulomatosis. A 54-year-old woman developed erythemato-violaceous lesions on both legs 3 years after a heart-lung transplantation. The diagnosis of erythema multiforme and of drug-induced vasculitis were first made. Because of fever and of the rapid extension of the lesions, the patient was hospitalized. The histologic examination of the first lesions showed a perivascular infiltrate, without epidermotropism, composed of histiocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of a predominantly T-cell infiltrate with some large B cells. Subsequent biopsies were diagnosed as high grade B-cell lymphoma. Polymerase chain reaction analysis as well as in situ hybridation study showed the presence of Epstein-Barr virus load in the lesions. There was however no serologic evidence of viral reactivation. Extensive systemic evaluation revealed no visceral or bone marrow involvement. Despite antiviral treatment and CHOP polychemotherapy, the patient died 3 months after her admission. This observation of lymphomatoid granulomatosis is particular because of its exclusive cutaneous involvement associated with a fulminant evolution to high grade B lymphoma. The presence of a context of iatrogenic immunosuppression underlies the role of altered immune cellular functions in the initiation and/or progression of lymphomatoid granulomatosis and strengthens the role of a viral agent in its pathogenesis. We suggest that the presence of Epstein-Barr virus, which is generally not associated with the isolated cutaneous forms of lymphomatoid granulomatosis, may have played a role in this fulminant evolution to high grade B lymphoma.

Muscles were studied at 37 degrees C and 1.0 Hz. Variables of isometric contraction were recorded before and after etomidate (0.04-80 microM) or its solvent, propylene glycol. The ability of beta-adrenergic stimulation to cause an inotropic effect after etomidate was also assessed. Etomidate caused a dose-dependent decrease in developed tension, which was statistically significant only at concentrations exceeding clinical doses (> or =20 microM; P < 0. 05). Decreases in maximum rates of contraction and relaxation paralleled changes in developed tension. beta-Adrenergic stimulation reversed the etomidate-induced decreases in developed tension and rates of contraction and relaxation to baseline (P > 0.05 compared with baseline). Thus, in human myocardium, etomidate exerts a dose-dependent negative inotropic effect, which is reversible with beta-adrenergic stimulation. Concentrations required to produce these negative inotropic effects are, however, in excess of those reached during clinical use. Therefore, etomidate-induced negative inotropy is unlikely to be a problem clinically, even in patients with cardiac dysfunction. Etomidate produced a similar dose-dependent negative inotropic effect in both failing and nonfailing human myocardium. This effect was present only at concentrations exceeding those attained clinically and was reversible with beta-adrenergic stimulation.

Therefore, we studied with positron emission tomography (PET) and 13N-ammonia the myocardial blood flow (MBF) reserve in heart transplant recipients free of allograft rejection and with angiographically normal coronary arteries early after heart transplantation (HTx). The MBF reserve was calculated as the ratio between MBF after dipyridamole injection and basal MBF normalized for the rate-pressure product. Patients were studied within 3 months (group A, n = 12) or more than 9 months (group B, n = 12) after HTx. Five patients have been studied both during the early and late period after HTx. Results were compared to those obtained in 7 normal volunteers (NL). Group A recipients had a significantly lower dipyridamole MBF (in ml/min/100 gr of tissue) than that of group B recipients (142+/-34 vs 195+/-59, p<0.05).

Separate analysis of 5 patients studied twice is consistent with these results.

Genetic polymorphism at position +915 of the TGF-beta1 gene determines the degree of cytokine production in response to injury. We investigated this allelic variation on the development of cardiac transplant-related coronary vasculopathy (CV). Using sequence-specific primers to the TGF-beta1 gene region of interest, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gel electrophoresis identified the genotype in 129 cardiac transplant recipients. An association was sought between the presence of a high- (GG) or low/intermediate-producing (CC/GC) genotype and the development of coronary vasculopathy diagnosed by coronary angiography. C allele carriers made up 10.9% of the recipient population but were significantly less likely to develop coronary vasculopathy (p = 0. 0361). Mean time to diagnosis was 1240.5 days in G homozygotes relative to 2266.5 days in C allele carriers (p = 0.002).

Review the acute and late results of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in heart transplant recipients and examine the factors predictive of restenosis. Coronary graft disease (CGD) is the main factor responsible for late graft loss. Medical treatment, surgical revascularization, or retransplantation gives only suboptimal results in this regard. Therefore, PTCA has been attempted in this situation. More than 332 heart transplantations in our institution have been performed since 1992, the date of the first PTCA in our patients. We are currently in charge of 450 patients. All the characteristics, procedure-related information, and clinical outcome of patients needing PTCA were assessed by review of each patient's clinical records. All coronary angiograms were reviewed by an independent cardiologist. Since 1992, 53 coronary sites have been dilated in the course of 39 procedures in 29 patients. Indication for PTCA was asymptomatic angiographic coronary graft disease in 35 sites (64.8%), angina in 9 (16.6%), silent ischemia in 2 (3.7%), acute myocardial infarction in 1 (1.8%), and CHF in 7 (12.9%). Primary success (< 50% residual stenosis) was obtained in 50 (94.3%) of 53 lesions. No periprocedural death occurred. Procedural complications were 1 transient acute renal failure and 1 persistent bleeding at the puncture site. Six months restenosis rate (defined as percent stenosis > 50%) was 32.5% (14/43). Mean follow-up was 1.27 year +/- 1.2 (SD). Five deaths (17. 2%) occurred in follow-up and were all in relation to coronary graft disease. Mean time separating PTCA from death was 0.9 year +/- 1.3 (SD). We also sought to look at factors predictive of restenosis. By multivariate analysis, a positive recipient's serology for cytomegalovirus (CMV) before the graft was the only factor found protective against restenosis (odds ratio 22.4; confidence interval 1.1 to 443.4). PTCA in heart transplant recipients allows a high level of primary success with a low periprocedural-complication rate. Restenosis rate seems equivalent to restenosis rate in native coronary arteries. Mortality during follow-up is increased in this population and is the consequence of a high level of coronary events.

We have previously shown that a single intrathymic injection of donor spleen cells into pre-sensitized rats abrogates accelerated (circa 24-hour) rejection and prolongs the survival of cardiac allografts to about 7 days. The present study was designed to investigate the mechanisms by which intrathymic administration of donor cells modifies the course of accelerated rejection. Lewis RT1(1) (LEW) rats sensitized by transplantation with Wistar-Furth RT1(u) (WF) skin grafts received WF cardiac allografts 7 days later-a classic model of accelerated rejection. At the time of skin challenge, however, certain animals received intrathymic cell suspensions (either allogeneic or syngeneic) or donor-derived class I and/or class II MHC peptides. Control animals (sensitized by skin grafts but receiving no other treatment) rejected cardiac allografts within 24 hours. Intrathymic injection of WF splenocytes at the time of skin transplantation abrogated rejection at 24 hours and prolonged cardiac allograft survival to 6.6+/-0.6 days (p<0.001), whereas intrathymic administration of syngeneic (LEW) or allogeneic third party Brown Norway RT1(n) cells was ineffective in this regard. Intrathymic injection of gamma-irradiated donor cells marginally extended cardiac allograft survival to 3.0+/-0.9 days (p< 0.001), but the grafts were still rejected in an accelerated fashion. Intrathymic injection of donor-derived class I and/or class II MHC allopeptides at the same time period also failed to prolong cardiac allograft survival beyond 3 days. In the group receiving unmodified donor cells, elevated immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) allo-antibodies were found at the time of cardiac transplantation; this pattern was not observed with any other treatment. The superiority of non-modified donor spleen cells over gamma-irradiated donor cells or donor specific allopeptides in modifying the course of accelerated cardiac rejection suggests that direct allorecognition is the dominant pathway initiating rejection in sensitized transplant recipients. Marked alterations in the antidonor IgM and IgG responses are associated with successful abrogation of accelerated rejection by thymic immunomodulatory mechanisms.

Intrathymic inoculation of donor alloantigen and concomitant immunosuppressive treatment can induce immune unresponsiveness to alloantigen. To examine the role of non-deletional mechanisms in the development of unresponsiveness, fractionated splenocytes were injected into only 1 lobe of the thymus. Untreated CBA (H2(k)) mice or controls pre-treated with anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody alone (on Day -28 and -27 relative to transplantation) acutely rejected C57BL/10 (H2(b)) cardiac allografts. Intrathymic inoculation of unfractionated splenocytes, resting B (rB) cells, or dendritic cells into both thymic lobes with the antibody resulted in indefinite survival of cardiac allografts. In contrast, when donor rB cells or dendritic cells were delivered into a single lobe of the thymus with the antibody, only rB cells induced indefinite prolongation of graft survival; unfractionated splenocytes or dendritic cells were markedly less effective. Mice that had 1 of the 2 thymic lobes removed were able to reject grafts even when treated with the antibody 27 days before transplantation. Therefore, T-cell export from 1 thymic lobe was sufficient to induce graft rejection. Finally, adoptive transfer of splenocytes from mice with long-term surviving primary grafts resulting from the intrathymic injection of rB cells significantly prolonged a graft from the same donor strain in a naive syngeneic recipient. Taken together, these data suggest that regulatory mechanisms generated by intrathymic injection of a non-professional antigen presenting cell, in this study donor rB cells, suppressed the rejection response mediated by T cells exported from the uninjected lobe.

Chronic allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is caused by the infiltration of host immune cells to a graft, but it has been technically difficult to monitor the movements of the cells in graft rejection. We used a male-specific gene, SRY, as a marker to investigate the dynamics of host cells in a model of CAV in which immunosuppression was unnecessary and anti-male responses were practically negligible. Fluorescent-based real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was adapted to estimate the fraction of host cells in a graft by the ratio of SRY to IL-2 gene. Using this technique, we studied the turnover and migration of host cells during the course of CAV progression by retransplanting female allografts from male to female or from female to male rats. We detected histologic CAV 60 days after retransplantation in allografts retransplanted to the F(1) progeny of donor x recipient on the 5th day, but not in those retransplanted on the 3rd day, regardless of the mismatches in the genders. Most of the initial infiltrating cells disappeared rapidly in both cases. The fraction of migrating cells from the second recipient, however, continuously increased in allografts developing CAV, and 60 days after retransplantation exceeded 50%, whereas it stayed at 5% to 15% in those not developing CAV. ED-1-positive macrophages/monocytes were likely candidates for the migrated cells. We have developed a simple method to measure the migration of host cells into a graft. This technique was useful, at least in certain rat strains, to investigate the cellular mechanisms of chronic cardiac allograft rejection.

Monitoring pig-to-primate cardiac xenografts is often difficult in awake and uncooperative primates. We investigated the possibility of monitoring xenotransplantation through Internet broadcasting of (1) continuous video images of transplant recipients and (2) xenograft telemetric signals detected by an implanted device. The telemetric readings were later compared with histology and immunohistochemistry for signs of rejection. Heterotopic baboon-to-baboon (n = 2) and transgenic pig (human complement regulatory proteins CD59/DAF, n = 3; MCP, n = 1)-to-baboon transplants were performed with serial biopsies for hematoxylin-and-eosin staining and immunohistochemical detection of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and complement membrane attack complex (MAC) deposition. Baboon recipients were continuously monitored with a QuickCamPro digital camera, whereas grafts were monitored with a Data Science International implantable telemetric system. Video images and telemetric signals were broadcast over the Internet through a laptop computer. Baboon allografts remained healthy until explant on Day 14, whereas pig xenografts were rejected on Day 5, 6, 7, and 11. Telemetry of allografts and xenografts documented regular rhythm with an average heart rate of 80 to 120, but xenografts developed bradycardia and widened/dampened QRS complexes 24 to 48 hours before graft loss. Continuous video monitoring of recipient activities was vital in differentiating between graft arrhythmias and telemetric artifacts. Allograft biopsies showed little cellular infiltrate, whereas xenograft biopsies showed increasing IgM and MAC deposition, with extensive thrombi and myocardial damage 24 hours before cessation of cardiac activities. Combined video surveillance of recipient activities and graft telemetric signals is a useful method to continuously monitor abdominal cardiac grafts in large, uncooperative, awake primates. QRS-complex widening associated with progressive bradycardia correlated with histologic and immunohistochemical evidence of xenograft rejection.

The immunohistochemical expression of adhesion molecules and class I HLA in chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy were compared with heart allograft rejection and dilated cardiomyopathy, to obtain new knowledge on the occurrence of autoimmunity and inflammation in the pathogenesis of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy. Semiquantitative immunohistochemistry was performed for CD8+ T cells, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, LFA-1, and class I HLA in frozen sections of myocardial biopsies from patients presenting chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (group I, n = 12), heart allograft rejection (group II, n = 9) or dilated cardiomyopathy (group III, n = 9). A high mean number of CD8+ T cells/mm(2) was present in group I (18.26) and group II (28.60), but not in group III (0.83). The frequency of high expression for ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on the endothelial and interstitial cells, and for class I HLA on the cardiomyocytes was greater in group I (100%, 33.3%, and 83.3%, respectively) and group II (100%, 66.7%, and 77.8%, respectively), compared to group III (66.7%, 0%, and 0%, respectively). ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 probably participate in the development of the lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate present in chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, as seen in heart allograft rejection. The overexpression of adhesion molecules and the induction of class I HLA on the cardiomyocytes are probably related to the high cytokine levels at the inflammatory sites in chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy. Although the induction of class I HLA on the cardiomyocytes is consistent with an autoimmune reaction, it should not be considered as irrefutable evidence for autoimmunity in chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy. The differential expression of adhesion molecules and class I HLA in dilated cardiomyopathy compared to chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy suggests differences in the pathogenesis of these cardiomyopathies.

Inasmuch as complement plays a critical role in many pathological processes and in xenograft rejection, efficient complement inhibitors are of great interest. Because the membrane-associated complement inhibitors are very effective, recombinant soluble molecules have been generated. We tested the efficacy of complement activation blocker-2 (CAB-2), a recombinant soluble chimeric protein derived from human decay accelerating factor (DAF, CD55) and membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46), in two models of pig-to-human xenotransplantation in which tissue injury is complement mediated. The in vitro model consisted of porcine aortic endothelial cells and human serum, and the ex vivo model consisted of a porcine heart perfused with human blood. In vitro, addition of CAB-2 to serum inhibited cytotoxicity and the deposition of C4b and iC3b on the endothelial cells. Ex vivo, addition of CAB-2 to human blood prolonged organ survival from 17.3 +/- 6.4 min in controls to 108 +/- 55.6 min with 910 nM (100 microg/ml) CAB-2 and 219.8 +/- 62.7 min with 1820 nM (200 microg/ml) CAB-2. CAB-2 also retarded the onset of increased coronary vascular resistance. The complement activity of the perfusate was reduced by CAB-2, as was the generation of C3a and SC5b-9. The myocardial tissues had similar deposition of IgG, IgM, and Clq; however, CAB-2 reduced the deposition of C3, C4, and C9. Hearts surviving >240 min demonstrated trace to no deposition of C9 and normal histologic architecture. These results indicate that CAB-2 can function as an inhibitor of complement activation and markedly reduce tissue injury in models of pig-to-human xenotransplantation and thus may represent a useful therapeutic agent for xenotransplantation and other complement-mediated conditions.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the incidence of rejection in relation to MMF trough level following heart transplantation. Between May 1998 and February 1999, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical outcome of 215 heart transplant patients who had routine monitoring of MMF trough level at the time of scheduled endomyocardial biopsy. Patients were divided into three groups according to the time interval post transplant, and were evaluated in relation to the MMF trough level. Group I, 104 patients within 6 months of transplant; Group II, 90 patients, 6-12 months post transplant; and Group III, 71 patients beyond one year of transplant. Fifty patients had samples in more than one group. Rejection was defined as Grade > or = 3A based on ISHLT criteria. Mean follow-up period was 179+/-52 days.

The purpose of this study was to prove the reliability of intramyocardial electrogram (IMEG) recordings for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of (1) cellular and (2) humoral mediated allograft rejection after heart transplantation. Fifteen beagle dogs underwent heterotopic neck-heart transplantation. Eight of them were previously sensitized through several skin transplantations. IMEG recordings were performed daily. Donor-specific antibodies (IgG, IgM) were determinated in serum daily. Transmyocardial biopsies were performed every two days. In the sensitized group (group I) accelerated rejection occurred under triple drug immunosuppression with cyclosporine A, azathioprine, and cortisone on the fifth postoperative day (range: 4th-5th). All episodes were detected through IMEG diagnosis. In each case rejection could be treated successfully. In the cellular mediated group (group II), the average sensitivity for rejection diagnosis of a single lead was 24% for the unipolar and 42% for the bipolar leads. When the voltages of different leads were summed up the sensitivity rose to 36% (3 unipolar), 81% (3 bipolar) and 100% (all leads). During rejection therapy the IMEG recovered within 24-48 hours. The IMEG detects cellular and humoral mediated rejection early and with high reliability. The rejection-related changes of grade 2/3a rejection in IMEG seem to follow a Ofocal patternO similar to the histology.

We show that CD4+ T cell-mediated rejection is prevented by anti-CD40L mAb therapy but that CD8+ T cells remain fully functional. Furthermore, blocking CD40L interactions has no effect on CD8+ T cell activation, proliferation, differentiation, homing to the target allograft, or cytokine production.

STAT4(-/-) mice have impaired Th1 responses, whereas STAT6(-/-) mice do not generate normal Th2 responses. Cardiac allografts from C57BL/6 mice were transplanted into normal wild-type (WT), STAT4(-/-), and STAT6(-/-) BALB/c recipients. STAT4(-/-) and STAT6(-/-) mice rejected their grafts with the same tempo as untreated WT recipients. CD28-B7 blockade by a single injection of CTLA4Ig induced long-term engraftment and donor-specific tolerance in all three groups of recipients. CD154 blockade by a single injection of MR1 was effective in prolonging allograft survival and inducing tolerance in STAT4(-/-) mice but was only marginally effective in STAT6(-/-) recipients and WT controls. In addition, a similar protocol of MR1 was ineffective in prolonging graft survival in CD28(-/-) BALB/c recipients, suggesting that the lack of efficacy seen in WT and STAT6(-/-) mice is not due to the presence of a functional CD28-B7 pathway. Furthermore, there was a similar differential effect of CD28-B7 versus CD154-CD40 blockade in inhibiting immune responses in animals immunized with ovalbumin and complete Freund's adjuvant.

Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibition with aminoguanidine would alleviate left ventricular stiffening and myocardial edema formation in 4-day heterotopic rat heart allografts.

To evaluate the potential effects of an important immunosuppressive agent, tacrolimus hydrate (FK-506), on monocyte/macrophages and their response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we exposed human monocyte/macrophage cell line (THP-1 cells), to LPS and characterized its procoagulant activity (PCA).

In addition, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction demonstrated reduced expression of TF mRNA in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells exposed to FK-506.

Th-2 cell responses produce IL-4 and IL-10 which may shift the immune response from the Th-1 pathway to Th-2 responses, favoring Ig production.

In the following studies, employing cardiac heterotopic allografts in rats (Brown Norway into Lewis), we investigated regulatory roles of Th-2-related cytokines IL-4 and IL-10. Two strategies were used in animals receiving allografts: antibody-induced blocking of endogenous IL-4 or IL-10 and exogenous administration of either interleukin. Antibody to IL-4 failed to alter the rejection time, whereas anti-IL-10 greatly accelerated the rejection process. Northern blot analysis of RNA from allografted hearts revealed mRNA for both IL-4 and IL-10, while immunostaining showed strong staining for IL-10 and very weak staining for IL-4.

After induction of anesthesia 13 months after transplantation, cardiac and intrinsic cardiac neuronal responses elicited by both electrical stimulation of parasympathetic or sympathetic efferent neurons and systemic or local coronary artery administration of nicotine (5 microg/kg), angiotensin II (0.75 microg/kg), and tyramine (1.2 microg/kg) were studied. The transmembrane electrical properties of intrinsic cardiac neurons were studied in vitro. Ventricular tissue catecholamine content, alpha-tubulin expression, and beta-adrenergic receptor density and affinity were studied. The presence of axons crossing suture lines was sought histologically. Nerves were identified crossing suture lines. Electrical or chemical (ie, nicotine or angiotensin II) activation of sympathetic efferent neurons enhanced cardiodynamics, as did tyramine. Stimulating vagal efferent preganglionic axons induced bradycardia in half of the dogs. Functional reinnervation did not correlate with specific power spectra derived from rate variability in the conscious state. Responding to nicotine and angiotensin II in situ, transplanted intrinsic cardiac neurons generated spontaneous activity. These neurons displayed nicotine-dependent synaptic inputs in vitro. Ventricular tissue had normal beta-adrenergic receptor affinity and density but reduced catecholamine and alpha-tubulin contents. The intrinsic cardiac nervous system receives reduced input from extracardiac sympathetic efferent neurons after transplantation and inconsistent input from parasympathetic efferent preganglionic neurons. These heterogeneous neuronal inputs are not reflected in heart rate variability or ventricular beta-adrenergic receptor function.

Heterotopic (\"piggyback\") transplantation is plagued by problems related to the retained, dilated, hypocontractile left ventricle (lung compression, systemic emboli, arrhythmias). Were it possible to retain the recipient's right heart, excising only the left ventricle, this could have important advantages, especially in severe pulmonary hypertension. This report describes such a technique. In four transplantation experiments (dogs), right ventricular-sparing transplantation proved technically feasible and hemodynamically successful. Bleeding after excision of the left ventricle was easily controlled. Back-bleeding from the native aortic valve (now open into the pericardial space) was not problematic. All atrial, aortic, and pulmonary arterial connections proved feasible. The preserved recipient right heart of all animals remained in stable sinus rhythm. All recipients were easily weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass, maintaining mean arterial pressures 60 to 110 mm Hg. This investigation develops a technique for donor right ventricle sparing in cardiac transplantation, demonstrating technical and hemodynamic feasibility. This method holds promise for the unsolved clinical problem of right heart failure after orthotopic heart transplantation with antecedent pulmonary hypertension.

The cytokine-induced activation and proliferation of medial vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) leading to intimal hyperplasia is one of the most critical cellular events in the formation of transplant arteriopathy and balloon angioplasty-induced restenosis. Allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1) is a calcium-binding protein that we have previously shown to be expressed in balloon angioplasty-injured rat carotid arteries. We hypothesized that AIF-1 expression may be associated with the VSMC response to injury. In this study, we examined AIF-1 expression in immunologic and mechanical models of arterial injury. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western analysis demonstrated that AIF-1 is acutely and transiently expressed in aortic medial smooth muscle cells of rat cardiac allografts, with mRNA and protein peaking at 3 to 7 days after transplant and declining by 10 days after transplant. Immunohistochemical analysis identified abundant AIF-1 in the medial VSMCs of these vessels. Immunohistochemical analysis of balloon angioplasty-injured swine coronary arteries also demonstrates an acute AIF-1 expression detectable by 24 hours and continuing up to 14 days after the procedure. AIF-1 in these vessels also localizes to the medial VSMCs and cells of the developing neointima. AIF-1 protein is not expressed in quiescent cultured human VSMCs but is induced in cells challenged with various inflammatory cytokines, primarily by interferon-gamma, interleukin-1beta, and T-cell-conditioned media. Transfection and overexpression of AIF-1 in human VSMCs result in enhanced growth of these cells. Taken together, these data indicate that AIF-1 expression is associated with vascular trauma and suggest that this protein may play a role in VSMC activation subsequent to arterial injury.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is a rare heart muscle disease characterized by right and often left ventricular myocardial atrophy and fibrofatty replacement. Heart failure, arrhythmias and sudden death are characteristic complications. We observed a female in whom arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy was diagnosed due to presyncopes and dyspnea on exertion. A left ventricular thrombus was found echocardiographically, which disappeared with oral anticoagulation. Subsequently, however, extensive thrombus formation in the dilated akinetic right ventricle occurred which was resistant to combined treatment with heparin and oral anticoagulation. Thrombophilia screening showed a mutant prothrombin 20210A allele which is an inherited coagulopathy associated with increased plasma levels of prothrombin and increased risks of mainly venous thrombosis. The patient developed endstage biventricular heart failure and underwent heart transplantation within 3 months after thrombus formation in the right ventricle was diagnosed.

Experience with IVUS for the diagnosis of PTCAD in children is limited. Patients were divided into two groups: those transplanted as neonates (early group) and those transplanted in infancy or childhood (late group). Morphometric analysis was performed, including maximal intimal thickness (MIT) and intimal index (II). Stanford classification was used to grade lesion severity. Acute rejection and cytomegalovirus (CMV) status were correlated with MIT and II. Thirty children were studied (early group, n = 13; late group, n = 17).

In heart transplant recipients (HTR), short-term systolic blood pressure variability is preserved, whereas heart rate variability is almost abolished. Heart period is the sum of left ventricular ejection time (LVET) and diastolic time (DT). In the present time-domain prospective study, we tested the hypothesis that short-term fluctuations in aortic pulse pressure (PP) in HTR were related to fluctuations in LVET. Seventeen male HTR (age 48 +/- 6 yr) were studied 16 +/- 11 mo after transplantation. Aortic root pressure was obtained over a 15-s period using a micromanometer both at rest (n = 17) and following the cold pressor test (CPT, n = 14). There was a strong positive linear relationship between beat-to-beat LVET and beat-to-beat PP in all patients at rest and in 13 of 14 patients following CPT (each P < 0.01). The slope of this relationship showed little scatter both at rest (0.34 +/- 0.07 mmHg/ms) and following CPT (0.35 +/- 0.09 mmHg/ms, P = not significant). Given the essentially fixed heart period, DT varied inversely with LVET. As a result, in 13 of 17 HTR at rest and in 12 of 14 HTR following CPT, there was a negative linear relationship between beat-to-beat PP and DT. In conclusion, our short-term time-domain study demonstrated a strong positive linear relationship between LVET and blood pressure variability in male HTR.

BACKGROUND-The increased plasma disappearance of albumin has previously been described in decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF); this disappearance normalized after diuretic treatment. Cardiac transplantation (HTX) and current medical treatment affect microvascular structure and function. We investigated the plasma disappearance of albumin and the impact of microvascular thickness and electrostatic properties in patients with compensated CHF and after HTX. METHODS AND RESULTS-The fraction of intravascular albumin that passes to the extravascular space per unit time, as determined from the plasma disappearance of intravenously injected (131)I-labeled albumin, was increased to 7.8+/-1.7% in 16 patients with CHF compared with 18 controls (6.5+/-1.9%, P<0.05); these levels normalized after HTX (5.8+/-2.6%, P<0.01, n=17). The change in ratio between (131)I-albumin and simultaneously injected negatively charged glycosylated (125)I-albumin (selectivity index, >1/hour in controls) was lower in patients with HTX (0.993+/-0. 022/hour) than in controls (1.008+/-0.019/hour; P<0.05), which indicated a relatively increased plasma disappearance of negatively charged albumin in HTX patients. Capillary basement membrane thickness was evaluated semiquantitatively from skin biopsies and showed no difference in the 3 groups (control, CHF, and HTX patients). However, in all 3 study groups, subjects with thicker capillary basement membranes had lower albumin escape rates (6.1+/-1. 8%, n=32, versus 7.6+/-2.6% in subjects without thickening of capillary basement membranes, n=19; P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS-The plasma disappearance of albumin increased in patients with compensated CHF and it normalized after HTX. The present normalized capillary basement thicknesses in patients with CHF and the direct association between this parameter and plasma albumin disappearance indicate that previous compensatory microvascular basement membrane growth results in restricted permeability. Microvascular electrostatic properties did not relate to plasma albumin disappearance.

BACKGROUND-Myocardial failure is an important problem after heart transplantation. Right ventricular (RV) failure is most common, although its mechanisms remain poorly understood. Inflammatory cytokines play an important role in heart failure. We studied the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and other cytokines in donor myocardium and their relationship to the subsequent development of RV failure early after transplantation. METHODS AND RESULTS-Clinical details were obtained, and ventricular function was assessed by transesophageal echocardiography in 26 donors before heart retrieval. A donor RV biopsy was obtained immediately before transplantation, and each recipient was followed for the development of RV failure. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect TNF-alpha, interleukin-2, interferon-gamma, and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression. Eight of 26 recipients (30.8%) developed RV failure. Seven of these 8 (87.5%) expressed TNF-alpha, but only 4 of the 18 (22.2%) who did not develop RV failure expressed TNF-alpha (P<0.005). As a predictor of RV failure, TNF-alpha mRNA had a sensitivity of 87.5%, a specificity of 83.3%, a positive predictive value of 70%, and a negative predictive value of 93.7%. Western blotting demonstrated more TNF-alpha protein in the myocardium of donor hearts that developed RV failure (658+/-60 versus 470+/-57 optical density units, P<0.05). Immunocytochemistry localized TNF-alpha expression to cardiac myocytes. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction detected interferon-gamma in 2 (7.7%), interleukin-2 in 1 (3.8%), and inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA in 1 (3.8%) of the 26 donor hearts, none of which developed RV failure.

BACKGROUND-Intravascular clotting has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). We previously identified the expression of tissue factor (TF), the primary cellular initiator of blood coagulation, within the coronary intima, which was associated with neointimal thickening. In the present study, the effect of recombinant hirudin on CAV was assessed in Lewis to Fisher rat heterotopic cardiac allografts. METHODS AND RESULTS-Transplant recipients were randomized to a control group (n=10) and a hirudin-treated group (n=12; 2 mg. kg(-1). d(-1) SC). Histological evaluations of rejection, CAV, and TF staining were performed 120 days after transplantation. No significant differences were observed between the 2 groups with respect to the degree of rejection. Hirudin significantly (P<0.05) suppressed the development of CAV in the graft microvessels, but it was less effective in large coronary arteries. Graft intimal cells, isolated by laser-assisted cell picking, showed a marked upregulation of TF gene transcription, which was prevented by hirudin (P<0.01). As demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative analyses of TF mRNA levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction, hirudin treatment resulted in a significant reduction of TF protein and mRNA expression (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS-Treatment with hirudin in this rat cardiac transplant model inhibited TF expression and decreased neointimal hyperplasia. These results suggest that TF inhibition by hirudin, in addition to its direct effect on thrombin, may attenuate the hypercoagulable state and prevent the development of CAV at least in restricted sites of the graft coronary vasculature.

Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) remains the leading cause of late mortality in heart transplant recipients. Activated T lymphocytes and macrophages infiltrate the donor heart before vascular intimal thickening develops, but the specific mediators of mononuclear cell recruitment leading to CAV are unknown. Therefore, we sought to define the relationship between chemokine gene expression and production, T lymphocyte and macrophage recruitment, and intimal thickening in a murine model of CAV. B10.A or B10.BR strain hearts were transplanted heterotopically into B10.BR mice. Recipients were killed at 1, 4, 7, 14, and 30 days. Donor hearts were assayed for chemokine gene expression with ribonuclease protection and for protein with ELISA. Intragraft cellular infiltration was defined immunohistochemically. Intimal thickening was quantitated morphometrically. Early and late patterns of intragraft chemokine expression associated with distinct cellular infiltration were identified. First, transient MIP-2 and MCP-1/JE production in isografts and allografts correlated with neutrophil and macrophage infiltration. MCP-1/JE production and macrophage infiltration was greater in allografts than isografts. Second, allografts demonstrated sustained lymphotactin, RANTES, and IP-10 expression, beginning at day 4, correlating with persistent macrophage and T lymphocyte infiltration. Intimal thickening became evident at 14 days. Isografts did not display the late pattern of sustained chemokine gene expression, cellular infiltration, or intimal thickening. Transient, early MIP-2, and MCP-1/JE production in isografts and allografts correlated with neutrophil and macrophage recruitment, and is likely related to ischemia-reperfusion. In allografts, the delayed induction of chemokines specific for macrophages and T lymphocytes correlated with mononuclear cell infiltration and preceded intimal thickening.

Here, we demonstrate that co-transplantation of donor-derived hepatocytes protect Lewis (RT1.A1) cardiac allografts from acute and chronic rejection in DA (RT1.Aa) recipients indefinitely. Livers of donor Lewis rats were harvested and the hepatocytes separated from hepatic leukocytes by collagenase digestion and gradient separation. DA recipient animals were transplanted Lewis cardiac allografts and simultaneously intraportally infused either Lewis-derived hepatocytes or hepatic leukocytes. Recipient animals were either not further treated or received a single dose of 15 mg/kg cyclosporine. Donor hepatocytes alone significantly protected syngeneic cardiac allografts from rejection, whereas hepatic leukocytes failed to influence graft survival. In combination with cyclosporine, recipient cardiac allografts were indefinitely protected from rejection.

Antibody-mediated rejection was investigated using hyperimmunized GALT/KO mice as recipients of GAL+ heart allografts. In young GALT/KO mice the levels of anti-GAL antibodies were low. Immunization of GALT/KO mice resulted in increased anti-GAL antibody expression. In mouse serum 0.6% of IgG was specific for alphaGAL compared to 0.5% in human serum.

Successful xenograft transplantation faces several obstacles including the presence of xenoantibodies, natural killer cell- and macrophage-mediated rejection, and T lymphocyte activation. A mouse-to-rat cardiac xenograft model was used to examine the synergistic effect of anti-T cell receptor (TCR) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and 15-deoxyspergualin (DSG) on graft survival. Pretransplantation injections (days -5, -3, and -1) of anti-TCR mAb (500 microg/kg/day) combined with continuous i.p. infusion of DSG (5 mg/kg/day) from day -7 to 28 significantly prolonged graft survival compared to untreated controls (3.3+/-0.5 vs. 44.2+/-5.6 days, P<0.001). Postoperative splenectomy combined with discontinuation of all other treatment on day 28 enhanced graft survival in rats treated with anti-TCR mAb and DSG to 71.0+/-2.5 days. Histological examination of grafts showed characteristic signs of vascular rejection: interstitial edema and hemorrhage, and polymorphonuclear cell infiltration. Antimouse antibody titers in recipients were increased upon rejection in each group that received a xenograft. Flow cytometry analysis showed a markedly decreased T cell population and a relatively increased mature B cell population (IgM(bright)/IgD(dull)) in spleens of rats treated with anti-TCR mAb and DSG on day 28. The mechanism of prolonged xenograft survival in this model may include inhibition of antibody production by arrest of B-cell maturation during development from IgM(dull)/IgD(bright) mature B cells to antibody producing cells, and inhibition of T cell activation. The rejection seen in our model may be caused by xenoreactive antibodies and may be associated with T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages.

Acute rejection of the heart allograft is the major cause of heart failure in the first month after transplantation. Most studies on the prevention of acute rejection have concentrated on immune suppression of the recipients, whereas little is known about the effects of genetically manipulated donor organs on heart allograft survival. Herein, we describe a mouse model of heart allografts donated by p53-/- mice that can prolong the survival time of the grafts. Hearts of p53-/- or p53+/+ C57BL/6J mice were grafted to the neck carotid artery and jugular vein of BALB/c mice using a cuff technique. The graft survival was observed daily. The hearts were analyzed using several techniques, including histology, immunofluorescence, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL), and Western blot analysis. p53+/+ allografts ceased beating at 7.6+/-0.5 days, whereas p53-/- hearts were beating at 10.5+/-1.1 days after transplantation (P<0.01). Mean histological rejection scores were significantly lower in allografts donated by p53-deficient mice. Furthermore, apoptotic cells, determined by TUNEL and a reagent kit for detection of cardiac apoptosis, were of high numbers in the allograft sections from wild-type hearts but rare in p53-/- allografts (4.2+/-1.3 vs. 0.7+/-0.5/250x field). Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis revealed that high levels of p53 and proapoptotic protein Bax were expressed in wild-type grafts but not p53-/- allografts. Interestingly, Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein, was abundant in cardiac allografts from p53-/- mice and almost undetectable in grafts from wild-type mice. Thus, p53 is involved in cardiac apoptosis induced by alloimmune reaction, and prolonged survival of heart allografts can be achieved when p53 is lacking.

Between 1987 and 1997, 136 patients required cardiac transplantation at Dijon hospital. During follow-up, 76 patients aged 51.2 +/- 9.46 years underwent catheter studies (12 women, 15.8%; and 64 men, 84.2%). Right and left heart catheterisation was performed at 3 months, 1, 2, 3 and 5 years after transplantation. Right heart catheterisation included measurement of mean pulmonary artery and pulmonary capillary pressures and pulmonary arteriolar resistances. During left heart catheterisation, cardiac output, mean aortic pressure, the ejection fraction, the dp/dt max of the left ventricular wall, systemic arterial resistances and left ventricular end diastolic pressures were measured. At each catheter study, the indexed myocardial mass, indexed end systolic and end diastolic left ventricular volumes, the mass/volume ratio, the residual serum cyclosporine concentrations and the serum creatinine were analysed. In addition, an endomyocardial biopsy was also performed. Initially raised, the mean pulmonary artery and pulmonary capillary pressures decrease from the 3rd month to the 2nd year. From the 3rd year onwards, they readjust to the upper limits of normal. The pulmonary artery resistances underwent the same changes. The left heart parameters remained constant over the period of follow-up but with a heart rate, mean aortic pressure and left ventricular end diastolic pressure higher than normal. The indexed myocardial mass was increased at all periods. The indexed left ventricular end systolic and diastolic volumes decreased with a M/V ratio which increased. Cyclosporine concentrations decreased whereas serum creatinine increased. The frequency of severe rejection and of coronary atherosclerosis was low. Significant correlations were observed between different parameters at different periods. In the long-term, the function of the transplanted heart is not normal in the strict sense of the term. The apparent normality is obtained by anti-hypertensive treatment. The transplanted heart adapts to the increase in cyclosporine-induced afterload by permanent myocardial hypertrophy, and increased diastolic pressure probably relates to diastolic dysfunction without noticeable intracardiac fibrosis.

E1-deleted adenoviral vectors are efficient vectors for somatic gene therapy. Recently, we have shown that intratracheal application of an adenoviral reporter construct leads to significant reporter gene expression in rat lungs within 24 h. In contrast, reporter gene expression in syngeneic rat heart transplants after adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was delayed. Since the adenovirus cannot replicate, down-regulation of the hCMV-IE promoter controlled reporter gene expression in initially infected cells by cytokines, which are released as a result of ischemia/reperfusion injury, might be involved. In order to investigate the role of proinflammatory cytokines, eg TNF-alpha in affecting hCMV-IE promoter-driven reporter gene expression, transient blockade of TNF-alpha was achieved by local co-application of an Ad-construct encoding for a soluble TNFRp55-Ig chimeric molecule in a syngeneic rat heart transplantation model. Co-application of the reporter construct together with the TNFRp55-Ig chimeric molecule significantly increased the early reporter gene expression after transplantation. Moreover, infiltration of inflammatory cells (T cells, macrophages, NK cells) and production of TNF-alpha in the transplant was markedly reduced. Our results indicate that: (1) proinflammatory cytokines are involved in down-regulation of reporter gene expression in ischemia/reperfusion injured tissues; and (2) inhibition of TNF-alpha might be a useful tool to increase early gene expression in gene therapy protocols, particularly in transplantation.

The role of natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages (M\u00f8s) in the absence of T cell immunity in discordant xenograft (xg) rejection was investigated. Guinea pig hearts were transplanted into athymic nude rats receiving no treatment or antixenoantibody (xAb), anticomplement (C), antinatural killer (NK) cell therapy (antiasialo GM1 [anti-ASGM1]) or their combinations. For anti-xAb therapy, natural xAbs were absorbed/neutralized by pretransplant guinea pig blood transfusion (pGPBT), followed by administration of the malononitriloamide MNA715. Cobra venom factor (CVF) was administered as anti-C therapy. FACScan analysis and a standard cytotoxicity assay determined NK cell number and cytotoxicity, respectively. ELISA and the CH50 assay measured titers of xAb and C activity, respectively. Rejected Xgs were examined by light microscopy and by immunohistochemistry. All hyperacutely (15+/-4 min) rejected Xgs from untreated rats showed deposits of C3 and IgM without cellular infiltrates. Combined anti-xAb and anti-C (pGPBT/MNA715/CVF) treatment significantly prolonged the survival of Xgs (3.7+/-0.6 days, P<0.001 vs. control group) showing NK cell and M\u00f8 infiltration without deposition of xAbs or C3. NK cell depletion (day -12) followed by exposure of recovering NK cells to the guinea pig antigens failed to induce specific NK cell nonresponsiveness and to further prolong xg survival in combined anti-xAb/anti-C group.

Investigations of the role of CD4 T lymphocytes in allograft rejection and tolerance have relied on the use of mouse models with a deficiency in CD4 cells. However, in mice treated with depleting monoclonal antibody (mAb) and in MHC class II knockout (KO) mice, there are residual populations of CD4 cells. CD4 KO mice had increased CD4- CD8-TCRalphabeta+ helper T cells, and both strains of KO mice could reject skin allografts at the normal rate. In this study, transgenic mice with no peripheral CD4 cells were the recipients of skin and heart allografts. Results were compared with allograft survival in CD4 and MHC class II KO mice. GK5 (C57BL/6 bml mice transgenic for a chimeric anti-CD4 antibody) had no peripheral CD4 cells. These mice, and CD4 and class II KO mice, received BALB/c or CBA skin or cardiac allografts. Some GK5 mice were treated with anti-CD8 mAb to investigate the role of CD8 cells in rejection. CD4 and CD8 cells were assessed by FACS and immunohistochemistry. BALB/c skin on GK5 mice had a mean survival time +/- SD of 24+/-6 days, compared with 9+/-2 days in wild-type mice. Anti-CD8 mAb prolonged this to 66+/-7 days. BALB/c skin survived 10+/-2 days on class II KO and 14+/-2 days on CD4 KO, both significantly less than the survival seen on GK5 recipients (P<0.001). BALB/c hearts survived >100 days in GK5 recipients and in wild-type recipients treated with anti-CD4 mAb at the time of grafting, in contrast to a mean survival time of 10+/-2 days in untreated wild-type mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed that long-term surviving heart allografts from the GK5 recipients had CD8 but no CD4 cellular infiltrate. These hearts showed evidence of transplant vasculopathy. The GK5 mice, with a complete absence of peripheral CD4 cells, provide the cleanest available model for investigating the role of CD4 lymphocytes in allograft rejection.

In this study, we investigated the role of 4-1BB costimulation in allogeneic T cell responses. Vascularized heart transplantation, allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR), and graft versus host disease models were used to examine 4-1BB and 4-1BBL expression. In addition, agonistic anti-4-1BB antibodies were used in MLR to functionally analyze T cell responses. Using a heart transplant model, we found that 4-1BB and 4-1BBL transcripts were both expressed in rejecting cardiac grafts. In the allogeneic MLR, 4-1BB was expressed on both activated CD4 and CD8 T cells and 4-1BB was expressed on T cells after multiple cell divisions in vivo. Functionally, 4-1BB was a potent stimulator of proliferation, cytokine secretion, and CD25 expression by CD8 T cells, but 4-1BB signals had a weak effect on the proliferation of CD4 T cells. Because 4-1BB promoted the secretion of IL-2 and the expression of CD25 on CD8 T cells, we investigated whether IL-2 was the only factor whereby 4-1BB signals induced CD8 T cell proliferation. Although IL-2 was required for optimal CD8 T cell proliferation, 4-1BB also costimulated CD8 T cell proliferation independently of IL-2. This study demonstrates that 4-1BB is expressed on activated, maximally divided T cells and shows that 4-1BB promotes CD8 T cell proliferation by enhancing signals through the IL-2 receptor and by other mechanisms independent of the IL-2 pathway.

E1-deleted adenoviral vectors are frequently used for in vivo gene therapy.

In this study, we asked whether an anti-CD4 mAb (RIB 5/2) treatment may improve the gene transfer into rat cardiac grafts. We injected recombinant ad-constructs encoding for Escherichia coli beta-gal into syngeneic rat heart transplants via the proximal aorta. One-half of the recipients of genetically modified grafts received the anti-CD4 mAb RIB 5/2, whereas the other half received no monoclonal antibody treatment. Genetically unmodified isografts without any treatment of the recipients were used as additional controls. At different time points hearts were harvested and analyzed for reporter gene expression, intragraft cellular infiltration, and cytokine gene expression (quantitative \"real time\" reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction). Serum samples were analyzed for anti-ad-Ig using enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay. In control animals the beta-gal reporter gene expression slowly increased until day 7 and then declined. The immunohistological and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction intragraft analyses revealed a strong inflammatory response (cellular infiltration, cytokine expression) in ad-transfected grafts that may explain the delayed expression and fast down-regulation of the transgene. Treatment with RIB 5/2 mAb resulted in a faster and prolonged reporter gene expression, reduced graft infiltration, reduced anti-ad-Ig titers and less interferon-gamma up-regulation.

Engraftment of allogeneic bone marrow (BM) has been shown to induce tolerance to organs genotypically matched with the BM donor. Immune reconstitution after BM transplantation therefore involves re-establishment of a T cell pool tolerant to antigens present on both donor and host tissues. However, how hematopoietic grafts exert their influence over the regenerating immune system is not completely understood. Prior studies suggest that education of the newly arising T cell pool involves distinct contributions from donor and host stromal elements. Specifically, negative selection is thought to be mediated primarily by donor BM-derived antigen-presenting cells, whereas positive selection is dictated by radio-resistant host-derived thymic stromal cells. In this report we studied the effect of highly purified allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) on organ transplantation tolerance induction and immune reconstitution. In contrast to engraftment of BM that results in near-complete donor T cell chimerism, HSC engraftment results in mixed T cell chimerism. Nonetheless we observed that HSC grafts induce tolerance to donor-matched neonatal heart grafts, and one way the HSC grafts alter host immune responses is via deletion of newly arising donor as well as radiation-resistant host T cells. Furthermore, using an in vivo assay of graft rejection to study positive selection we made the unexpected observation that T cells in chimeric mice rejected grafts only in the context of the donor MHC type. These latter findings conflict with the conventionally held view that radio-resistant host elements primarily dictate positive selection.

Patients with osteoporosis had less BMI that patients without, indicating a protective effect of body mass. Patients with osteoporosis also had a greater time of evolution of the disease. There is a decreased bone mass in lumbar spine and hip and a higher prevalence of osteoporosis in patients with cardiac failure before cardiac transplantation. Time of waiting for cardiac transplantation has been an important factor found in the development of metabolic bone disease in these patients.

A cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the use of HeartMate is more cost-effective than the use of Biomedicus assist device. Using HeartMate one life-year gained costs DKK 225,000. Using Biomedicus one life-year gained costs DKK 270,000. The use of HeartMate results in an additional expenditure of DKK 615,000 per patient.

The current technique of cardiac preservation for clinical transplantation by infusion of cold cardioplegia and immersion of the heart in an isotonic saline bath at 4 degrees C limits safe tissue preservation time to 4 to 6 hours. The myriad of benefits to be gained by extending cardiac preservation time has prompted the search for alternatives to hypothermic immersion of the heart, the most promising of which involves techniques of coronary artery perfusion. Countless studies have shown the benefits of long-term storage of donor hearts by perfusion rather than the immersion technique. Continuous perfusion preservation has three basic advantages over simple immersion. Perfusion preservation with oxygen carrying solutions has the advantage of preventing ischemia, anaerobic metabolism, and reperfusion injury. Second, nutritional supplementation and provision of substrate can be more effectively delivered to myocardial cells. Third, continuous perfusion preservation effects the clearance of metabolic waste products from the coronary circulation. The composition of the ideal perfusion solution and optimal preservation conditions remain incompletely defined.

We studied the capacity of four \"normal\" and six lung transplant subjects to entrain neural respiratory activity to mechanical ventilation. Two transplant subjects were studied during wakefulness and demonstrated entrainment indistinguishable from that of normal awake subjects. We studied four normal subjects and four lung transplant subjects during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Normal subjects entrained to mechanical ventilation over a range of ventilator frequencies that were within +/-3-5 breaths of the spontaneous respiratory rate of each subject. After lung transplantation, during which the vagi were cut, subjects did demonstrate entrainment during NREM sleep; however, entrainment only occurred at ventilator frequencies at or above each subject's spontaneous respiratory rate, and entrainment was less effective. We conclude that there is no absolute requirement for vagal feedback to induce entrainment in subjects, which is in striking contrast to anesthetized animals in which vagotomy uniformly abolishes entrainment. On the other hand, vagal feedback clearly enhances the fidelity of entrainment and extends the range of mechanical frequencies over which entrainment can occur.

The authors assess clinical and radiographic findings of pulmonary nodules and masses after lung and heart-lung transplantation. One hundred and fifty nine patients who survived at least 3 months after lung and heart-lung transplantation were followed by serial chest radiographs for a median of 27 months. Single or multiple lung nodules or masses were noted at chest radiography in 15 (9.4%) of 159 patients. Imaging findings and causes of these nodules and masses were reviewed retrospectively. Infection was found in 10 (6%) of 159 patients. Specific pathogens (11 pathogens in 10 patients) were Aspergillus (n = 4), Mycobacteria (n = 4), and other bacteria (n = 3). Noninfectious causes were found in 5 (3%) of patients and included B-cell lymphoma (n = 2), bronchogenic carcinoma (n = 2), and pulmonary infarcts (n = 1). Nodules and masses appeared a median of 11 months after transplantation (range: 0.2 to 36 months). Five patients (33%) had single lesions; the other 10 (67%) patients had multiple lesions (range 2 to 50). Aspergillus lesions were most commonly located in the upper lobes, were cavitary in three of four patients, and all were fatal. Nodules and masses arose in the transplanted lung in 12 (80%) of the patients, and in the native lung in 3 (20%) of the patients (2 bronchogenic carcinoma, 1 M. tuberculosis simulating bronchogenic carcinoma). Nodules and masses detected by chest radiography are not uncommon (9.4%) after lung and heart-lung transplantation. Infections are more common than noninfectious causes of posttransplant nodules and masses. Specific clinical and imaging characteristics may provide clues to etiology.

Based on previous reports by our group, initial studies on non-invasive cardiac graft monitoring have been presented recently. In this study we define new parameters to monitor rejection and infection after heart transplantation (HTX) the ventricular evoked response (VER) T-slew rate parameter is defined as the maximum negative slope in the descending part of the repolarization phase of the VER. We calculated the VER duration parameter in milliseconds and defined it as the time between the pacemaker spike and the cross-over of the baseline, with the slope line used to calculate the VER T-slew rate. During the HTX procedure, we implant wide-band telemetric pacemakers and fractally coated, epimyocardial electrodes (Physios CTM 01 and ELC 54-UP, Biotronik; Berlin, Germany). During each follow-up and on biopsy days, intramyocardial electrogram sequences were obtained and sent via the Internet to the central data-processing unit in Graz. We scored the infection status of the patients before data acquisition. The VER parameters were automatically calculated and send back within a few minutes. We prospectivly compared 1,613 follow-ups from 42 patients with biopsy (International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation grading) and infection classification. The VER duration parameter did not change during rejection; however, we found an increase during clinically apparent infection. The VER T-slew rate parameter was lower during rejection grade 2 or higher, as well as during clinically apparent infection. The negative predictive value to rule out rejection was 99%. Our results indicate that rejection and infection cause different, reproducible effects on the electrical activity of the transplanted heart.

Median age was 53 years, and all patients were male. Nodules were detected 23 to 158 days after HT (median, 66 days). An etiologic diagnosis was made in all but 1 case: Aspergillus (5), Nocardia-Rhodococcus (4), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) (3). Previous severe infection was present in 50% of the patients and rejection in 33% (75% with nocardiosis). Initially all patients with Nocardia but only 1 patient with aspergillosis were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were fever (67%) and cough (50%). Central nervous system (CNS) involvement appeared in only one Aspergillus-infected patient. An average of 1.8 diagnostic procedures per patient were performed. Median time to establish a diagnosis was 8 days (0 to 24). Median hospital stay was 36 days and reached 60 in patients with Aspergillus. No patient died, although aspergillosis, which must be suspected in the presence of dyspnea, pleuritic pain, and CNS symptoms, caused the highest morbidity. Overall diagnostic yield was 60% for transtracheal aspiration, 70% for bronchoalveolar lavage, and 75% for transthoracic aspiration.

FK409 is the first spontaneous nitric oxide donor to increase plasma guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate. We designed this study to investigate whether the administration of FK409 during reperfusion ameliorated ischemia-reperfusion injury and enhanced post-transplant graft function in orthotopic heart transplantation following 12-hour cold preservation in a canine model. We used 10 pairs of adult mongrel dogs, weighing 9.5 to 13.5 kg. Following cardiac arrest using cardioplegia, we washed out the coronary vascular beds with cold University of Wisconsin solution followed by 12-hour preservation. After preservation, we performed orthotopic transplantation. The experimental animals were divided into 2 groups. In the FK group (n = 5), FK409 (5 microg/kg/min) was administered intravenously, beginning 15 minutes before the onset of reperfusion and continuing for 45 minutes after reperfusion. In the control group (n = 5), saline vehicle was administered in the same manner. Two hours after transplantation, we assessed cardiac function, including cardiac output, left ventricular systolic pressure (LVP), and the maximum rates of positive and negative increase of LVP (+/-LV dP/dt) by comparing the recovery rate (%) of the cardiac function of the donor animal. We measured endothelin-1 levels in blood obtained from a catheter inserted into the coronary sinus 30, 60, and 120 minutes after reperfusion. Cardiac output was higher in the FK group than in the control group, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.08). Left ventricular systolic pressure and +/-LV dP/dt were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the FK group than in the control group. Endothelin-1 levels were significantly (p < 0.05) lower in the FK group than in the control group 30 minutes after reperfusion. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the basal lamina of capillary vessels, glycogen granules, and mitochondrial structure were well-preserved in the FK group.

Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), the most important long-term complication after lung transplantation, is thought to be a manifestation of chronic rejection within the airways, with the hallmarks inflammation and fibroproliferation. To characterize the inflammatory process in the context of OB we quantified tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta on the protein and mRNA level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples obtained from patients with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and without BOS. In addition, bronchial cells sampled by bronchial brushing were analyzed for mRNA expression. In respiratory epithelial lining fluid (ELF) from BOS patients the protein levels of IL-8 (52.4+/-22.2 vs. 4.4+/-0.9 pg/ml ELF, P<0.005) and TGF-beta (5.6+/-1.9 vs. 0.9+/-0.2 ng/ml ELF, P<0.005) were significantly elevated. In addition, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells of BOS patients showed increased expression of TGF-beta (1.13+/-0.44 vs. 0.45+/-0.16, optical density [O.D.]/O.D. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH], P=0.11) and IL-8 (0.25+/-0.13 vs. 0.09+/-0.03 O.D/O.D.

Endomyocardial biopsy procedure has been employed as the 'gold standard' for rejection surveillance. Previous studies have questioned the value of surveillance EMB beyond the early post-transplant period. We retrospectively reviewed data on 82 pediatric heart transplant recipients with serial EMB. A total of 1,169 EMB were performed during a follow-up period of 2-149 months (median 41 months). EMB were classified by age at transplantation, time from transplant, immunosuppressive regimen used [tacrolimus vs. cyclosporin A (CsA)] and indication, i.e. surveillance, follow-up after rejection or lowering of immunosuppression, non-specific clinical symptoms and graft dysfunction. During the first year after heart transplantation, surveillance EMB demonstrated significant rejection [International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) grade > or = 3A] in 18% of biopsies with the yield being 14-43% for all other indications. Surveillance EMB 1-5 yr post-transplantation were found to have a lower diagnostic yield in infants (4%, vs. 13% in children) and in patients with favorable first-year rejection history (9% vs. 17% in 'frequent rejectors'). Tacrolimus-based immunosuppression was associated with significantly less rejection, but only in the first year post-transplantation (14% in tacrolimus vs. 24% in CsA surveillance EMB, p = 0.035).

The role of hyperlipidemia in graft coronary artery disease (GCAD) is controversial although hyper-triglyceridemia is an independent risk factor. Recent studies show that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) inhibitors decrease the incidence of GCAD in adults. The incidence of GCAD in pediatric patients is lower than in adults; it is not clear whether age-related differences in lipid metabolism account for some of this protection. This study was performed to: characterize the lipoprotein profile in children after heart transplantation; demonstrate that total cholesterol (TC) is a poor marker for underlying lipoprotein abnormalities; and to compare lipid abnormalities in patients who had been converted from cyclosporin A (CsA) to tacrolimus. Seventy-one determinations of fasting lipoprotein profiles were performed in a cohort of 28 children. Each child had at least two determinations on separate occasions. TC, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and serum triglyceride (TG) levels were categorized as abnormal if greater than the 75th percentile for age and gender. A high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level less than the 25th percentile was considered abnormal. Immunosuppression included CsA or tacrolimus, azathioprine, and prednisone. We found that 90% of the patients studied had abnormalities of either TG or HDL. In contrast, LDL tended to be normal when adjusted for age and gender. TC was a poor indicator of any underlying abnormality in TG, LDL, or HDL. In patients converted to tacrolimus, no significant differences were found in the levels of TG, LDL or HDL compared with each patient's respective values while receiving CsA. Hence, lipoprotein abnormalities among pediatric heart transplant recipients are highly prevalent. TC is a poor screening tool in the evaluation for lipid abnormalities.

We sought to test the hypothesis that plasma volume (PV) expansion in heart transplant recipients (HTRs) is caused by failure to reflexively suppress the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) axis. Extracellular fluid volume expansion occurs in clinically stable HTRs who become hypertensive. We have previously demonstrated that the RAA axis is not reflexively suppressed by a hypervolemic stimulus in HTRs. Plasma volume and fluid regulatory hormones were measured in eight HTRs (57+/-6 years old) both before and after treatment with captopril (225 mg/day). Antihypertensive and diuretic agents were discontinued 10 days before. The HTRs were admitted to the Clinical Research Center (CRC), and, after three days of a constant diet containing 87 mEq/day of Na+, PV was measured by using the modified Evans blue dye dilution technique. After approximately four months (16+/-5 weeks), the same HTRs again discontinued all antihypertensive and diuretic agents; they were progressed to a captopril dose of 75 mg three times per day over 14 days, and the CRC protocol was repeated. Captopril pharmacologically suppressed (p<0.05) supine rest levels of angiotensin II (-65%) and aldosterone (-75%). The reductions in vasopressin and atrial natriuretic peptide levels after captopril did not reach statistical significance. The PV, normalized for body weight (ml/kg), was significantly reduced by 12% when the HTRs received captopril. Extracellular fluid volume is expanded (12%) in clinically stable HTRs who become hypertensive. Pharmacologic suppression of the RAA axis with high-dose captopril (225 mg/day) returned HTRs to a normovolemic state. These findings indicate that fluid retention is partly engendered by a failure to reflexively suppress the RAA axis when HTRs become hypervolemic.

We hypothesized that plasma factors important for the development of atherosclerosis play a major role in the occurrence of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is a major cause of death among heart transplant recipients, has a poorly understood pathogenesis and has similarities to atherosclerotic coronary disease. The study population consisted of 93 postcardiac transplant recipients. Thirty-one patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and 18 healthy individuals served as control subjects. Posttransplant coronary anatomy was evaluated by angiography and intravascular ultrasound. Laboratory analyses of lipids, homocysteine, vitamin B12 and folate, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor antigen (vWFAg) and renin were obtained on all participants. Posttransplant patients were found to have elevated serum triglycerides, total cholesterol/ high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, lipoprotein (a), homocysteine, vWFAg, fibrinogen and renin and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Most of these laboratory atherogenic factors were also elevated to a similar degree in the CHF control population. Although most atherogenic markers were elevated, there was little correlation with CAV severity. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy severity varied with time after transplantation, 3-hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor use and prior cytomegalovirus infection. Even within the normal range, lower RBC folate levels were associated with increased severity of CAV. The posttransplant course is associated with increased clinical and laboratory atherogenic factors, some of which likely contribute to the severity of coronary vasculopathy. Compared with normal control subjects, many of these markers are already increased in pretransplant CHF patients with or without occlusive coronary artery disease.

Data on the clinical significance of VTCs are lacking in patients with DCM and ICDs. Baseline characteristics of 106 consecutive patients with DCM and ICDs were prospectively collected, and chart reviews and episode data retrospectively analyzed. A VTC was defined as > or =3 sustained VTs/24 h. During a mean follow-up of 33+/-23 months, 73 patients (68.9%) had recurrent VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF), 43 patients (40.6%) suffered only single VTs and 30 patients (28.3%) experienced 52 clusters of VTs. Actuarial survival free of VT or VF was 44.6%, 33.0% and 26.5%, and survival free of VTC was 77.3%, 72.2% and 67.1% after one, two and three years, respectively. Independent predictors of VT clusters were heart failure before ICD implantation (p = 0.033), presenting monomorphic VT (p = 0.044), EF <0.40 (p = 0.014) and inducible mVT, especially with right bundle branch block and superior axis configuration (p<0.001).

Dendritic cells (DC) classically promote immune responses but can be manipulated to induce antigen-specific hyporesponsiveness in vitro. The expression of costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD86, CD80) at the DC cell surface correlates with their capacity to induce or suppress immune responses. Expression of these molecules is associated with NF-kB-dependent transcription of their genes. DC tolerogenicity has been associated with impaired NF-kB-dependent transcription of costimulatory genes as well as NF-kB translocation to the nucleus. In this report, we demonstrate that double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing binding sites for NF-kB (NF-kB ODN) are efficiently incorporated by bone marrow-derived DC and specifically inhibit NF-kB-dependent transcription of a reporter gene. Moreover, exposure of DC to the oligonucleotide decoys inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide production, a marker of DC maturation. Treatment of bone marrow-derived DC progenitors with NF-kB ODN selectively suppressed the cell-surface expression of costimulatory molecules without interfering with MHC class I or class II expression. Furthermore, NF-kB ODN DC induced allogeneic donor-specific hyporesponsiveness in mixed leukocyte cultures, and this was associated with inhibition of Th1-type cytokine production. Finally, infusion of NF-kB ODN-modified bone marrow-derived DC into allogeneic recipients prior to heart transplantation resulted in significant prolongation of allograft survival in the absence of immunosuppression. Specific interference with NF-kB and other transcriptional pathways involved in immune stimulation in DC using ODN decoy approaches could be one means to promote tolerance induction in organ transplantation.

A retrospective descriptive and histomorphometric study of postmortem L2/L3 vertebral bone biopsy specimens was undertaken on tissue from 11 posttransplant CF patients and 4 nontransplanted CF patients. Control data were derived from postmortem bone specimens from 15 young adults. Bone from all CF patients was characterized by severe osteopenia in both trabecular and cortical bone. At the cellular level, there was decreased osteoblastic and increased osteoclastic activity. The reduction in osteoblastic activity was due to both a decrease in osteoblast number and a decrease in the biosynthetic potential of osteoblasts. The osteoclastic changes were due to an increase in the number of osteoclasts. The increase in osteoclasis and the uncoupling of osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity resulted in an increase in resorptive surfaces. Although there were few significant differences between the transplanted and nontransplanted CF groups, both cortical and trabecular bone mass tended to be lower after transplantation. None of the CF undecalcified biopsy specimens showed osteoid parameters characteristic of vitamin D deficiency osteomalacia.

Dendritic cells (DC) were cultured from mouse bone marrow (BM) progenitors in low concentrations of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (GM(lo) DC) by two different protocols. The phenotype and functional properties of these GM(lo) DC were compared to those of standard BM-DC cultures generated in high concentrations of GM-CSF (GM(hi) DC) or in low GM-CSF plus IL-4 (GM(lo)/IL-4 DC). An effect of IL-4 on maturation was observed only at low but not high doses of GM-CSF. Compared to mature DC, GM(lo) DC were phenotypically immature, weak stimulators of allogeneic and peptide-specific T cell responses, but substantially more potent in presentation of native protein. Immature GM(lo) DC were resistant to maturation by lipopolysaccharide, TNF-alpha or anti-CD40 monoclonal antibodies, as the expression of co-stimulatory molecules was not increased, and stimulatory activity in oxidative mitogenesis was not enhanced. These maturation-resistant immature GM(lo) DC induced T cell unresponsiveness in vitro and in vivo. GM(lo) DC also prolonged haplotype-specific cardiac allograft survival (from 8 days to >100 days median survival time) when they were administered 7 days (but not 3, 14 or 28 days) before transplantation.

A 37-year-old man who had successfully undergone cardiac transplantation for dilated cardiomyopathy presented with a history of severe pain over his left shoulder, rib cage and thoracic spine. Clinical examination revealed the presence of bony tenderness over these sites, but there was no other clinical evidence of malignancy. Further investigations suggested the presence of multiple bony metastases. Bone biopsy revealed extensive bone marrow infiltration by large undifferentiated cells showing pronounced cytoplasmic vacuolation with a striking granulomatous reaction. Immunocytochemistry revealed these anaplastic cells to be cytokeratin and placenta-like alkaline phosphatase positive but S100, CD30 and lymphoid marker negative. Analyses by in situ hybridisation of these cells revealed no evidence of Epstein-Barr virus infection. Overall the pathology suggested a diagnosis of metastatic seminoma. Confirmation of this diagnosis was obtained by the analysis of serum human chorionic gonadotrophin which was elevated at 90 IU/l. In the absence of testicular or retroperitoneal disease, it is very likely that this unusual case of metastatic seminoma was related to the patient's immunosuppressive therapy, which at diagnosis included cyclosporin and prednisolone. The patient was successfully treated with cisplatin based chemotherapy and decreased immunosuppression and remains in complete remission one year after completion of chemotherapy. Seminoma is an uncommon complication of prolonged immunosuppression with very few cases being described in the literature post-organ transplantation. This case shows that the clinical presentation of this treatable tumour in this patient population can be unusual and difficult to diagnose.

Demographic data, risk factors, and disease course were evaluated in patients who developed cancer. The mean length of follow-up was 8.9+/-5.2 years. One hundred twenty patients (11.2%) developed 547 non-lymphomatous malignancies. The mean number of malignancies per cancer patient was 4.6. The average time from transplantation to development of cancer was 63.1 months. A total of 50.5% of malignancies presented in the head and neck; 96.4% of these were cutaneous in origin and 3.6% were noncutaneous. Of cutaneous malignancies, 79.3% were squamous cell carcinoma and 15.9% were basal cell carcinoma Cutaneous malignancies most commonly presented on the scalp, cheek, lip, and neck. Noncutaneous malignancies involved the oral cavity (5), thyroid (4), and parotid (1). Thirteen percent of cutaneous head and neck cancers behaved aggressively, requiring extensive management including radical surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. A total of 34.2% of cancer patients developed metastases and 54.9% of cancer patients died as a direct result of cancer.

Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is sometimes observed even though the allograft may survive indefinitely. In this study, we examined whether or not the preferential activation of Th2-type cells prevents the development of CAV. Hearts from C57BL/10 mice were transplanted heterotopically into the abdominal cavities of C3H.He recipient mice, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to T-cell receptor (TCR) alphabeta or CD80/CD86 were administered after transplantation. The incidence of CAV was then examined histologically. To investigate the relative Th1/Th2 balance, the levels of IFNgamma and IL4 in the transplanted hearts were measured. Indefinite heart graft survival was observed in mice treated with either the anti-TCRalphabeta or anti-CD80/CD86 mAbs and these mice accepted donor-type (C57BL/10) skin grafts but rejected those from a third party (BALB/c). Evidence of CAV was found in the mice treated with the anti-TCRalphabeta mAb, but CAV did not develop in the mice treated with anti-CD80/CD86 mAbs. Preferential activation of Th2-type cells was dominant in the tolerant mice treated with anti-TCRalphabeta mAb, but it was not dominant in the tolerant mice treated with anti-CD80/CD86 mAbs. These findings suggest that the dominance of Th2-type cells does not prevent allograft vasculopathy.

Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), norepinephrine, and endothelin-1 were measured at rest in all patients, who also underwent a symptom-limited maximal exercise with oxygen consumption (VO(2)) determination. After a median follow-up of 789 days, 52 deaths and 31 heart transplantations occurred, of which 4 were urgent. In an univariate analysis, New York Heart Association functional class, systolic blood pressure at rest, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, left ventricular ejection fraction, peak VO(2), percent of predicted peak VO(2), plasma ANP, plasma norepinephrine, and plasma endothelin-1 were associated with survival without urgent heart transplantation. In a multivariate stepwise regression analysis, only plasma ANP (p = 0.0001), left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.007), and plasma norepinephrine (p = 0.035), but neither peak VO(2) nor percentage of predicted peak VO(2), were independent predictors of death or urgent heart transplantation. Determination of plasma ANP and norepinephrine provides additional independent information for long-term prognostic determination compared with exercise testing alone.

Baseline heart rate and systemic blood pressure were higher in Htx; left ventricular mass index and ADM tended to be higher after heart transplantation and correlated positively in Htx (r = 0.79, P = 0.03). As expected, exercise-induced increase in heart rate was lower in Htx than in controls (60 +/- 11 % vs. 121 +/- 14 %, respectively) and blood pressure increase was similar in both groups. Maximal exercise increased significantly plasma ADM in both groups (from 25.3 +/- 3.1 to 30.7 +/- 3.5 pmol/L, P < 0.05 and from 15.2 +/- 1.4 to 29.1 +/- 4.4 pmol/L, P = 0.02 in Htx and controls, respectively), the hypotensive peptide level remaining elevated until the 30th min of recovery. A significant inverse relationship was observed between peak mean blood pressure and circulating ADM in Htx (r = -0.86, P < 0.02). Besides showing that circulating ADM is increased after heart transplantation, the present study demonstrates a positive relationship between baseline ADM and left ventricular mass index. Furthermore, maximal exercise-induced increase in ADM is inversely related to mean blood pressure in Htx, suggesting that ADM might participate in blood pressure regulation during exercise after heart transplantation.

Recent experimental data indicate that the targeting of the costimulatory molecule CD40-ligand (CD154) may well offer an opportunity for tolerance induction in transplant recipients and patients with autoimmune diseases, although the optimal therapeutic strategy for clinical application of CD154 monoclonal antibody (mAb) is unclear. We undertook vascularized heterotopic cardiac allograft transplantation in completely MHC-mismatched mice, treated recipients with CD154 mAb plus various immunosuppressive agents, and performed flow cytometric analysis of CD154 expression by T cells activated in vitro in the presence of corresponding immunosuppressive agents. We also tested the extent to which CD154 induction was NFkappaB-dependent by using NFkappaB/p50-deficient mice as allograft recipients and as source of cells for in vitro studies of CD154 induction, and through use of proteasome inhibitors to block IkappaBalpha degradation and NFKB activation in wild-type mice. Concomitant use of cyclosporin A or methylprednisolone, but not rapamycin or mycophenolate, inhibited CD154 mAb-induced allograft survival. The differential effects of these agents on CD154 mAb-induced tolerance correlated with their capacity to inhibit activation-induced CD154 expression on CD4+ T cells. Full expression of CD154 expression was found to require NF-kappaB activation, and CD154 mAb was ineffective in NF-kappaB/p50 deficient allograft recipients or control mice in which NF-kappaB activation was blocked by proteasome inhibition. Strategies to use CD154 mAb clinically must take into account the effects of immunosuppressive agents on CD154 induction, which seems to be at least partially NF-kappaB dependent. Our data suggest that ligation of surface-expressed CD154 provides an important signal that modulates T cell activation and thereby contributes to the effects of CD154 mAb, in addition to previously recognized actions involving blockade of CD40/CD154-dependent cell activation and activation-induced cell death.

PG27 administered intraperitoneally to Lewis recipients for 16 days at 10-30 mg/kg/day significantly increased the median survival time of BN heart allografts from 7 to 18-22 days. Oral administration was effective, with cardiac allograft survival prolonged to > 100 days with 52 days of treatment. PG27 at 20-30 mg/kg/day significantly extended the median survival time of BN kidney allograft recipients from 9 to 36.5-77 days, and 30 mg/kg/day for 52 days extended survival beyond 200 days.

Adhesion of leukocytes to vascular endothelium is an early step in cardiac allograft rejection leading to migration of lymphocytes into parenchymal tissues. Cell adhesion molecule (CAM) protein expression appears to increase as a result of rejection. The relationship of CAM gene expression to rejection is less well defined. The goal of this study was to define cell adhesion molecule gene expression in relation to the presence of acute cellular rejection in endomyocardial biopsies from cardiac transplant recipients. To quantitatively assess intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin gene expression, we developed a competitive PCR system using nonhomologous DNA fragments (MIMICs) with complementary sequences to CAM gene-specific primers as internal standards. MIMIC fragments with known concentrations were mixed in serial dilutions with constant amounts of cDNA from the biopsy specimens and amplified with common primers under the same polymerase chain reaction conditions. The relative CAM cDNA concentrations were determined by comparing the density of MIMIC to target cDNA bands on agarose gel. ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin mRNA concentrations were analyzed from 38 cardiac transplant biopsies divided into 3 groups according to ISHLT rejection grade: group 1-grade 0 (n=13); group 2-grade 1A or 1B (n=13); group 3-grade 3A (n=12). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (a constitutive gene) was quantified in the same way as CAMs to normalize the relative levels of CAMs. The results expressed as mean (1x10(-3) pM) (+/-SEM) in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, were: ICAM-1; 5+/-1; 57+/-4*; 64+/-13*, VCAM-1; 0.8+/-0.1; 6+/-1**; 9+/-1*, E-selectin; 0.4+/-0.2; 0.8+/-0.2; 0.4+/-0.1 (*P<0.001 versus group 1; **P<0.01 versus group 1).

Graft-resident antigen presenting cells (APCs) are potent stimulators of the alloresponse. To test whether replacement of graft-resident donor-type APCs with those of recipient-type alters allorecognition and the pathogenesis of both acute and chronic rejection, we created chimeric hearts for transplantation into naive recipients. To replace donor-type APCs with those of recipient-type, chimeric animals were created by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in fully allogeneic mouse and rat strain combinations. The degree of APC replacement in chimeric organs was assessed phenotypically and functionally. Chimeric hearts were transplanted heterotopically into untreated recipients. Flow cytometric and immunohistochemical analysis did not detect residual bone marrow recipient-type APCs in mouse BMT chimeras. Although semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction detected 0.001-0.01% residual cells, APCs isolated from chimeric organs were functionally unable to stimulate donor-type cells. When transplanted into naive recipients, chimeric mouse hearts had significantly prolonged survival but were nevertheless rejected acutely. Similar results were obtained in the ACI --> LEW rat strain combination. However, in the PVG --> DA rat model, the majority of chimeric hearts survived >100 days and all long-surviving hearts developed cardiac allograft vasculopathy. BMT leads to near complete replacement of organ-resident APCs. The virtual absence of donor-type APCs in chimeric hearts delays or prevents acute rejection in a strain-dependent manner.

However, an increased risk of malignancies has been attributed to prolonged immunosuppression, and there is evidence that less intensive immunosuppressive regimens are feasible in the long-term course after other solid organ transplantation. Therefore, we investigated the effects of AZA withdrawal in stable lung transplant recipients.

A total of 24 patients qualified for the study and 7 discontinued AZA.

Postbypass refractory right ventricle (RRV) may develop due to right ventricular (RV) ischemia or infarction. In cases with RV infarction, recovery is often prolonged and salvage rate is extremely poor. In this retrospective study, we have examined the role of right ventricular exclusion (RVE), as a possible option to conventional weaning or bridging to heart transplant (B-HTX), in patients who were unsuitable for heart transplant. During last 5 years, cumulative incidence of postbypass refractory circulatory failure (RCF) in our adult patients was 0.39% (26/6542). This problem was caused by a RRV in 17 (65%) patients. After CABG, these patients developed a grossly distended and poorly contracting RV (RVEDV: 330-400 ml, RVEF: 0-10%), high central venous pressure (> or =18 mmHg) and an inadequate aortic pressure for weaning off cardiopulmonary bypass. Three patients, who were unacceptable for HTX under UNOS program (age >65 years), were weaned off bypass after RVE, and remaining patients with RVAD (n=3) or BiVAD support, depending upon their concomitant moderate or poor left ventricular performance. The significant predictors of RRV by univariate analysis were; 2nd or 3rd redo CABG for a recent myocardial infarction, and failed graft angioplasty. Hospital mortality (14-60 days) was 0/3, 3/3 and 3/11 for the patients weaned off with RVE, RVAD and BiVAD respectively. At 3 years, overall salvage rate was 9/17 (RVE: 3/3, BiVAD B-HTX 4/6 + 2 weaned with BiVAD support). Right ventricular exclusion is a possible option to conventional B-HTX with mechanical support, in patients who develop postinfarct RRV and are unsuitable for transplant.

The aim of this study was to compare the results obtained from the use of both University of Wisconsin (UW) solution and diluted blood in short-term coronary perfusion following 12-hour cold storage. Following coronary vascular washout of adult mongrel dogs with the UW solution, the heart was excised and immersed in a cold (4 degrees C) UW solution for 12 hours followed by 1-hour of coronary perfusion. Two different solutions were used for the coronary perfusion; a 4 degrees C oxygenated UW solution (Group U, n=7) and 15 degrees C oxygenated diluted blood (Group B, n=7). Myocardial high energy phosphate (HEP) levels, tissue water content (TWC), interstitial tissue space (ITS) rates and histological findings were evaluated at 0- and 12-hour cold storage and also following coronary perfusion. The preserved graft was then evaluated through orthotopic transplantation. The control group in this experiment consisted of seven hearts transplanted after 12-hour cold storage without coronary perfusion. Myocardial HEP levels significantly decreased after 12-hour cold storage. The recovery rate of myocardial HEP levels after coronary perfusion was significantly (p<0.05) higher in Group B than in Group U. The increase of myocardial TWC during coronary perfusion was significantly (p<0.01) higher in Group B than in Group U. After 1-hour coronary perfusion, the subendocardial ITS rate was significantly (p<0.01) higher compared with the value at 0-hour cold storage in Group U, whereas it demonstrated no significant change in Group B. PAS stain revealed the glycogen content of the subendocardial tissues was higher in Group B than in Group U. The recovery rate of hemodynamic parameters 2 hours after heart transplantation was higher in Group U and significantly (p<0.05) higher in Group B than in the control.

It is believed to be genetically programmed and occurs as a physiologic process in various organ systems of body. Although it has been tacitly believed that apoptosis does not occur in the terminally differentiated adult heart muscle cells, studies in endomyocardial biopsies from patients with dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy and in explanted hearts from patients with end-stage heart failure undergoing cardiac transplantation have demonstrated histochemical evidence of apoptosis. It has been proposed that ventricular dilatation and neurohormonal activation during heart failure lead to upregulation of transcription factors, induce myocyte hypertrophy, and prepare the cell for entry into the cell cycle. However, terminally differentiated myocytes cannot divide, and failing to divide they undergo apoptosis. Initiation of apoptosis is associated with activation of upstream cascade, including the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytoplasm and the processing of proteolytic caspases. The activation of caspases leads to fragmentation of various cytoplasmic proteins, including contractile proteins. However, the nuclear fragmentation and condensation is completed only rarely. It is hypothesized that the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and cytoplasmic protein loss in a living heart muscle cell should lead to systolic dysfunction.

Transplant vasculopathy is the main limiting factor of the long-term success of heart transplantation. We sought to establish the role of platelets in the development and progression of transplant vasculopathy.

Quantitative intracoronary ultrasound was used to define the severity of disease at baseline (48.8+/-4.5 months after transplantation) and at 1-year follow-up. Platelet activation was assessed with the use of immunological surface markers of activation (ligand-induced binding site 1 [LIBS-1], P-selectin, GPIIb-IIIa) and flow cytometry. We found that LIBS-1 immunoreactivity was significantly increased in patients with diffuse disease when compared with focal transplant disease (median [quartile], 27[14, 64] versus 18[7.9, 47], P=0.04). In a logistic regression model, we found that LIBS-1 was an independent predictor for the presence and progression of diffuse transplant vasculopathy (P=0.04). Patients with enhanced LIBS-1 levels (>75% quartile) had a 3.3-fold increased relative risk (95% CI 1.8 and 18.9, P=0.002) for the presence of diffuse transplant vasculopathy.

We have previously demonstrated that it is possible to perform retransplantation of a xenogeneic heart (mouse-to-rat) using cyclosporine A as monotherapy, provided that the first heart is transplanted under a short course of deoxyspergualin (DSG). If DSG is omitted, the first heart is rejected within four days and the second heart succumbs to hyperacute rejection within minutes. A mouse heart as first graft does not protect a consecutive pancreatic islet graft, although the heart continues to function after rejection of the cellular graft. One explanation for this discrepancy may be the fact that cellular grafts, as pancreatic islets, lack an endothelial lining. We have, therefore, further investigated possible differences between vascularized and non-vascularized xenografts regarding their capacity to induce unresponsiveness. The use of pancreatic islets as primary graft neither accelerated nor decelerated the speed of rejection of the vascularized heart used as secondary graft. Furthermore, hemagglutinating and cytotoxic antibody titres responded in the same manner as in naive rats transplanted with a mouse heart. Retransplantation with pancreatic islets also resulted in complete rejection of both the primary and secondary grafts. Thus, the lack of unresponsiveness cannot simply be explained by differences, between the pancreatic and cardiac tissues, in antigen expression. In addition, intraperitoneal transplantation of mouse heart cells as primary graft resulted in rejection of a secondary cardiac graft after three days. However, it cannot be totally excluded that the time of antigen exposure had an impact on these results. In conclusion, our previous and present studies suggest that the presence of an intact vascular bed, both in the first and second graft, is necessary to create a state of unresponsiveness. Because the pancreatic islets lack an endothelial lining, they do not benefit from an unresponsiveness of the immune system. Neither are they able to induce such an unresponsiveness.

The purpose of the current study was to determine the functional consequences of beta-adrenergic receptor manipulation in a rabbit model of cardiac allograft transplantation. New Zealand White rabbits weighing 3 kg served as recipients to 1-kg outbred donors. Donor hearts were arrested and harvested, and 1 of 3 adenoviral constructs was administered into the aortic root perfusing the graft. Transgenes delivered encoded either the human beta(2)-adrenergic receptor, a peptide inhibitor of beta-adrenergic receptor densensitization, or the marker transgene beta-galactosidase. Five days after cervical heterotopic transplantation, left ventricular performance was measured on a Langendorff apparatus. A moderate pattern of rejection was seen in all grafts. Biventricular myocyte expression of beta-galactosidase was observed, and beta(2)-adrenergic receptor density was elevated 10-fold in grafts that received adeno-beta(2)-adrenergic receptor. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic performance was significantly increased in grafts transfected with either adeno-beta(2)-adrenergic receptor or adeno-beta-adrenergic receptor densensitization compared with control grafts that received adeno-beta-galactosidase.

To a large degree, it was a lack of specificity in these approaches that led to their falling out of favor.

Sinus node dysfunction occurs commonly after orthotopic heart transplantation and may be caused by surgical trauma, ischemia to the sinus node, rejection, drug therapy and increasing donor age. In the past, using the standard biatrial technique described originally by Lower and Shumway, many series have reported permanent pacing in more than 10% of patients. Unlike sinus node dysfunction in nontransplanted patients, which typically worsens with time, sinus node dysfunction in the transplanted heart usually improves over a period of weeks to months. Delaying the implantation of a permanent pacemaker may render it unnecessary. The development of the bicaval technique for implantation of the donor heart appears to have decreased even further or even eliminated the need for early permanent pacing. Because sinus node dysfunction in the transplanted heart does not predict subsequent development of atrioventricular (AV) node dysfunction, rate-responsive atrial pacing should be used in the majority of cases. Even after appropriate pacing for sinus node dysfunction, the sinus node may recover and permanent pacing may be discontinued. AV conduction abnormalities are far less common and generally occur late after transplantation. Dual-chamber pacing is required and permanent pacing should be continued indefinitely.

Cardiac allograft rejection is a multifocal immune process that is currently assessed using biopsy-guided histologic classification systems (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation). Cardiac troponin T and I are established serologic markers of global myocyte damage. The use of load-independent measures of contractility have also been shown to accurately assess the presence of ventricular dysfunction. Little is known about their utility in accurately predicting rejection in the pediatric age group. We undertook the present study to compare rejection grade with echocardiographic and serologic estimates of transplant rejection-related myocardial damage. We compared histologic rejection grades (0 to 4) with patient characteristics, echocardiographic measurements, catheterization measurements, and biochemical markers for 86 evaluations in 37 transplant recipients at Children's Hospital. In univariate analyses, biopsy scores correlated (p < 0.05) inversely with left ventricular systolic function (shortening fraction) and contractility (stress velocity index, SVI), and directly with mitral E-wave amplitude. In multivariate analyses, lower contractility and higher mitral E-wave amplitude remained significantly (p < or = 0.01) associated with rejection (SVI, p = 0.002, odds ratio = 0.393; E wave, p = 0.0002, odds ratio = 228). Most rejection episodes were associated with elevation of biochemical markers of myocardial injury. Although troponin I was weakly associated with differences between rejection grades (p = 0.034), troponin T, creatine kinase-MB fraction, and C-reactive protein did not differ with biopsy-rejection scores. Serum markers had a poor predictive capacity for biopsy-detected rejection. Troponin T and I did correlate with increased left ventricular wall thickness and mass. Progressively depressed left ventricular contractility and diastolic function are found with worsening pediatric heart transplant rejection-biopsy score; however, sensitive and specific serum markers do not correspond to the degree of active myocardial injury. The use of echocardiographic measures of contractility is associated with a specificity of 91.8% but low sensitivity of 66.7%. Overall we found poor concordance between serum markers and grade of rejection. It is unclear whether myocardial injury as assessed by serum markers, echocardiography, or histologic scoring is more important for assessment of acute rejection or long-term outcome, but it does not appear that serum and tissue markers of rejection can be used interchangeably.

Neutrophils are major participants in myocardial reperfusion injury, but the relationship between ischemic time and the extent of the neutrophil sequestration in heart transplantation has not yet been systematically studied. This study was designed to determine whether increased ischemic time would cause greater neutrophil sequestration during reperfusion of the globally ischemic heart. Rabbit hearts were arrested with cardioplegia, explanted, and subjected to either 1 or 4 hours of global ischemia at 4 degrees C before being heterotopically transplanted into a recipient rabbit's abdomen for reperfusion. Each heart was reperfused for either 4, 8, or 12 hours. Between 3 and 7 hearts were studied (average = 5.8) for each combination of ischemic and reperfusion time (total = 35). A myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay was used to qualify neutrophil content. MPO activity (U/g wet weight) was not significantly different at 4, 8, and 12 hours of reperfusion (0.33 +/- 0.05, 0.20 +/- 0.04, 0.26 +/- 0.04: p = 0.13), but was significantly increased at 4 hours compared to 1 hour ischemia (0.34 +/- 0.04 vs 0.19 +/- 0.03: p = 0. 006). Interaction between ischemic and reperfusion times was not significant (p = 0.12). MPO activity was below the measurable threshold in 5 freshly excised control hearts. These results suggest that acute reperfusion injury will be more severe in the hearts subjected to 4 hours ischemia and indicate the need to consider neutrophil-mediated reperfusion injury when addressing cardioprotective interventions for cardiac preservation and reperfusion after transplantation. Neutrophil-mediated reperfusion injury of the rabbit myocardium after heterotopical transplantation is more severe in hearts subjected to 4 hours of ischemia vs 1 hour of ischemia prior to transplantation.

Measurements of intramyocardial impedance at high frequencies can indicate alterations in cell membranes and intracellular spaces during acute cardiac allograft rejection. Fifteen beagle dogs underwent heterotopic heart transplantation and were immunosuppressed with cyclosporine and methyl prednisolone (MP). Impedance was determined twice daily by means of four screw-in electrodes in the right and left ventricle. Transmyocardial biopsies and the intramyocardial electrogram (IMEG) were performed as reference methods. A total of 23 rejection episodes were induced. When acute rejection was recognized histologically and through IMEG readings, the animals were treated with a bolus of 125 mg of methyl prednisolone over 5 consecutive days. Treatment of rejection was controlled by biopsy and IMEG. All hearts showed a uniform decrease in impedance of about 28.3%+/-5.5% immediately after transplantation, which subsequently reached a stable plateau after 7 to 8 days. Impedance values then remained unchanged as long as rejection was absent. Biopsy findings of grades 1A to 1B (ISHLT) were accompanied by a statistically significant increase in impedance of 12.2%+/-2.5%; of grades 2 to 3A of 19.2%+/-3.2% and of grades 3B to 4 of 27.0%+/-2.9%. Sensitivity was 96%, specificity 91%. Successful treatment of rejection led to a decrease of impedance to the initial levels. The amount of increase in impedance of high frequencies is a method to stratify acute cardiac allograft rejection into grades like histologically grading. The effectiveness of rejection treatment can also be monitored through impedance measurement. The method is also applicable for telemetric rejection monitoring by means of an implantable device.

C-raf is a well-characterized serine/ threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinase that is involved in the transduction of multiple signals of T cells. We demonstrate that the inhibition of C-raf mRNA expression prolongs heart allograft survival. Three 20-mer C-raf antisense oligonucleotides, each with identical sequences, were synthesized with different chemical modifications: one as a uniform phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (PS oligo), a second with a PS backbone and 2'-methoxyethyl (ME) substitutions at the 2'-sugar positions in the first and last five nucleotides, and a third with a mixed PS and phosphodiester (PD) backbone and ME modifications on the first and last five nucleotides. Both ME-modified C-raf antisense oligos were at least 5-fold more effective than the PS C-raf antisense oligo in blocking C-raf mRNA expression in two cell lines. Similarly, each of the ME C-raf antisense oligos produced better heart allograft survival rates than did PS C-raf oligo. Furthermore, although the combination of PS C-raf antisense oligo with sirolimus (SRL) acted synergistically to extend heart allograft survival, the effect was potentiated by either of the ME-modified oligos. C-raf inhibition extends heart allograft survival, and ME-modification potentiates antisense activity. ", "label": 0}{"text": "Ontogeny of antipig xenoantibody and hyperacute rejection.

To study risk factors for early and late death after heart transplantation in the current era. The current cardiac transplant population differs from earlier periods in that an increasing number of sicker patients, such as those with ventricular assist device (LVAD) support, prior cardiac allotransplantation, and pulmonary hypertension, are undergoing transplantation. In addition, sensitized patients constitute a greater proportion of the transplanted population. Emphasis has been placed on therapies to prevent early graft loss, such as the use of nitric oxide and improved immunosuppression, in addition to newer therapies. Five hundred thirty-six patients undergoing heart transplantation between 1993 and 1999 at a single center were evaluated (464 adults and 72 children; 109 had received prior LVAD support and 24 underwent retransplantation). The mean patient age at transplantation was 44.9 years. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the following risk factors on survival: donor and recipient demographics, ischemic time, LVAD, retransplantation, pretransplant pulmonary vascular resistance, and immunologic variables (ABO, HLA matching, and pretransplant anti-HLA antibodies). The rate of early death (less than 30 days) was 8.5% in adults and 8.8% in children. The actuarial survival rate of the 536 patients was 83%, 77%, and 71% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively, by Kaplan Meier analysis. Risk factors adversely affecting survival included the year of transplant, donor age, and donor-recipient gender mismatching. Neither early nor late death was influenced by elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, sensitization, prior LVAD support, or prior cardiac allotransplantation. Previously identified risk factors did not adversely affect short- or long-term survival of heart transplant recipients in the current era. The steady improvement in survival during this period argues that advances in transplantation have offset the increasing acuity of transplant recipients.

Myocardial injury from ischemia can be augmented after reperfusion due to proinflammatory events including complement activation, leukocyte adhesion, and release of various chemical mediators. It has been shown that intracoronary administration of a C1 esterase inhibitor (C1 INH) significantly reduces myocardial necrosis in an experimental model of ischemia. Our study addresses the question whether the most susceptible region of the heart for ischemic injury, the right ventricle (RV), can benefit from the protective effects of C1 esterase inhibition after transplantation. To precisely control RV volume in vivo an isovolumic model was used in which the RV volume was regulated using an intracavity high compliance balloon inserted into donor hearts of domestic pigs (34+/-4 kg). After 4 h of ischemia, donor hearts were transplanted into recipient pigs (44+/-4 kg). Treatment groups, each with six animals, consisted of C1 INH treatment or control. After opening the cross clamp, the C1 INH group animals received 20 IU/kg body weight of C1 INH intracoronary over a 5 min period. The control animals received no drug therapy. The hearts were reperfused for 60 min, and thereafter the RV balloon volume was increased in 10 ml increments until RV failure occurred. These measurements were repeated after 120 min of reperfusion. There was no significant difference in maximal RV developed pressure between the two groups (after 1 h, 35.7+/-5.9 vs. 40.6+/-12.7 mm Hg; after 2 h, 41.5+/-10.7 vs. 46.3+/-15.2 mm Hg; for C1 INH and control animals, respectively). However, the RV could be loaded with a significantly higher volume after both 1 h (60.0+/-20.0 ml (C1 INH) vs. 46.7+/-13.7 ml (control) balloon volume, P<0.05), and 2 h of reperfusion (70.0+/-8.9 ml vs. 60.0+/-6.3 ml; C1 INH and control animals, respectively; P<0.05). Intracoronary administration of a C1 INH significantly improves right ventricular function in an experimental transplant model. Thus, inhibition of the classic complement cascade may be a promising therapeutic approach for effective protection of myocardium from reperfusion injury after transplantation.

Occlusive accelerated atherosclerosis of coronary grafts is the predominant factor that limits longevity of heart transplant recipients. This form of vascular disease affects both the large epicardial and the smaller intramyocardial vessels, leading to characteristic clinical presentation that necessitates the use of sophisticated techniques for their accurate detection. Accelerated atherosclerosis after transplantation is a multifactorial disease with many events contributing to its progression. The initial vascular injury associated with ischemia-reperfusion appears to aggravate preexisting conditions in the donor vasculature in addition to activation of new immunological and nonimmunological mechanisms. Throughout these events, the endothelium remains a primary target of cell- and humoral-mediated injury. Changes in the vascular intima leads to alterations in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) physiology, resulting in VSMC phenotypic modulation with the orchestration of a broad spectrum of growth and inflammatory reactions, which might be a healing response to vascular injury. Endogenous nitric oxide (NO) pathways regulate a multiplicity of cellular mechanisms that play a major role in determining the structure and function of the vessel wall during normal conditions and during remodeling associated with accelerated atherosclerosis. Recently identified signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and transcriptional events in which nuclear factor kappa B and activator protein 1 take part, can be associated with NO modulation of cell cycle perturbations and phenotypic alteration of VSMC during accelerated atherosclerosis. This article reviews recent progress covering the aforementioned matters. We start by summarizing the clincal aspects and pathogenesis of accelerated atherosclerosis associated with transplantation, including clinical presentation and detection. This summary is followed by a discussion of the multiple factors of the disease process, including immunological and nonimmunolgical contributions. The next section focuses on cellular responses of the VSMCs relevant to lesion formation, with special emphasis on classical and recent paradigms of phenotypic modulation of these cells. To examine the influence of NO on VSMC phenotypic modulation and consequent lesion development, we briefly overview characteristics of NO production in the normal coronary vascular bed and the changes in endogenous NO release and activity during atherosclerosis. This overview is followed by a section covering molecular mechanisms whereby NO regulates a range of signaling pathways, transcriptional events underlying cell cycle perturbation, and phenotypic alteration of VSMC in accelerated atherosclerosis.

IL-15 is a T cell growth factor that shares many functional similarities with IL-2 and has recently been shown to be present in tissue and organ allografts, leading to speculation that IL-15 may contribute to graft rejection. Here, we report on the in vivo use of an IL-15 antagonist, a soluble fragment of the murine IL-15R alpha-chain, to investigate the contribution of IL-15 to the rejection of fully vascularized cardiac allografts in a mouse experimental model. Administration of soluble fragment of the murine IL-15R alpha-chain (sIL-15Ralpha) to CBA/Ca (H-2k) recipients for 10 days completely prevented rejection of minor histocompatibility complex-mismatched B10.BR (H-2k) heart grafts (median survival time (MST) of >100 days vs MST of 10 days for control recipients) and led to a state of donor-specific immunologic tolerance. Treatment of CBA/Ca recipients with sIL-15Ralpha alone had only a modest effect on the survival of fully MHC-mismatched BALB/c (H-2d) heart grafts. However, administration of sIL-15Ralpha together with a single dose of a nondepleting anti-CD4 mAb (YTS 177.9) delayed mononuclear cell infiltration of the grafts and markedly prolonged graft survival (MST of 60 days vs MST of 20 days for treatment with anti-CD4 alone). Prolonged graft survival was accompanied in vitro by reduced proliferation and IFN-gamma production by spleen cells, whereas CTL and alloantibody levels were similar to those in animals given anti-CD4 mAb alone. These findings demonstrate that IL-15 plays an important role in the rejection of a vascularized organ allograft and that antagonists to IL-15 may be of therapeutic value in preventing allograft rejection.

Chronic cardiac allograft rejection presents pathologically as graft arteriosclerosis (GA) characterized by recipient T cell and monocyte infiltration. To determine whether oligoclonal T cells are present in coronary arteries of cardiac allografts from patients with GA, we conducted sequencing analysis of beta-chain TCR transcripts from these explanted coronary arteries using the nonpalindromic adaptor-PCR. Substantial proportions of identical beta-chain TCR transcripts in three of five patients were observed, clearly demonstrating the presence of oligoclonal T cells. TCR transcripts from the arteries of two other patients were relative heterogeneous. High proportions of identical CDR3 beta-chain TCR motifs were found in each patient. GENEBANK/EMBL/SWISS PROT database comparison of all sequences revealed that these beta-chain TCR transcripts were novel. Using Vbeta-specific PCR (independent amplification), we found in patient GA03 that the TCR transcript that was clonally expanded in the left anterior descending artery after nonpalindromic adaptor-PCR was also clonally expanded in the right coronary artery of the same allograft. These results demonstrate that this TCR transcript was clonally expanded at different anatomic sides of the cardiac allograft in a systemic manner. In two patients identical beta-chain TCR transcripts that were found to be clonally expanded in the coronary arteries of their explanted cardiac allografts were also found to be clonally explanted in endomyocardial biopsies collected 17 and 21 mo earlier from each patient. The presence of oligoclonal populations of T cells in the rejected graft suggest that these T cells have undergone specific Ag-driven proliferation and clonal expansion early on within the graft and persist throughout the post-transplantation period.

Although interruption of CD40-CD40L interactions via their respective mAbs yields prolonged allograft survival, the relative importance of CD40 or CD40L on donor or host cells remains unknown. Moreover, it is uncertain whether any allospecific tolerance occurring with CD40-CD40L blockade will also prevent allograft arteriopathy, the major long-term limitation to transplantation. Therefore, we performed cardiac transplantations using CD40L-deficient (CD40L-/-) mice to investigate the mechanisms underlying prolonged allograft survival. Without immunosuppression, wild-type (WT) hosts rejected allo-mismatched WT or CD40L-/- heart allografts within 2 wk. Conversely, allografts in CD40L-/- hosts beat vigorously for 12 wk. Anti-CD40 treatment did not induce graft failure in CD40L-/- recipients. Although graft-infiltrating cells were reduced approximately 50% in CD40L-/- hosts, the relative percentages of macrophages and T cell subsets were comparable to WT. IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-10 were diminished commensurate with the reduced cellular infiltrate; IL-4 was not detected. CD40L-/- recipients did not develop IgG alloantibodies and showed diminished B7 and CD28 expression on subsets of graft-infiltrating cells. CD40L-/- transplant recipients developed allospecific tolerance to the donor haplotype; second set donor skin grafts engrafted well, whereas third-party skin grafts were vigorously rejected. By MLR, splenocytes from CD40L-/- allograft recipients also demonstrated allo-specific hyporesponsiveness. Nevertheless, allografts in CD40L-/- hosts developed significant graft arteriosclerosis by 8-12 wk posttransplant. Therefore, we propose that early alloresponses, without CD40-CD40L costimulation, induce allospecific tolerance but may trigger allo-independent mechanisms that ultimately result in graft vasculopathy.

The optimisation of cyclosporin therapy remains a challenge because of the very narrow therapeutic window and the highly variable pharmacokinetics of the drug. Therefore, there has been a concerted effort in the clinical transplant community to explore and test cyclosporin monitoring tools and techniques that will allow blood concentrations of cyclosporin to be maintained within the narrow therapeutic window in order to maximise efficacy and minimise toxicity. Absorption profiling is a simple and accurate technique for adjusting dosages of cyclosporin microemulsion that utilises an estimation of the rate and extent of cyclosporin absorption in order to optimise immunosuppression in the individual patient. Two estimation tools in particular are an abbreviated area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for the first 4 hours postdose and a single sampling point at 2 hours postdose. These 2 monitoring strategies have not only been validated as an accurate estimation of cyclosporin bioavailability but have been demonstrated to significantly improve clinical outcomes in patients compared with traditional trough concentration monitoring. The evidence presented in this review demonstrates that absorption profiling results in the following clinical benefits compared with trough concentration monitoring: (i) reduced incidence of acute rejection; (ii) reduced severity of rejection episodes; (iii) reduced nephrotoxicity; and (iv) a rational basis for dosage adjustments. The optimisation of immunosuppressive therapy continues to be a major priority in the management of the organ transplant recipient. Absorption profiling is a sensitive and practical approach for optimising the dosage of cyclosporin microemulsion, and can further extend the benefits of cyclosporin immunosuppression in the individual patient.

In this 2-year double-blind, stratified study, 65 patients undergoing cardiac or single lung transplantation were randomly allocated to receive either placebo or calcitriol (0.5-0.75 microg/day), the latter for either 12 months or 24 months. All patients received 600 mg calcium/day. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured every 6 months for 2 years by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. There was no significant difference between groups with respect to age or cumulative dose of prednis(ol)one or cyclosporine over the 2 years. Bone loss at the proximal femur was significantly reduced or prevented at all three sites by treatment with calcitriol for 2 years compared with treatment with calcium alone. Treatment with calcitriol for 12 months followed by calcium for 12 months resulted in similar proximal femoral bone loss to that seen in those patients treated with calcium for 24 months, suggesting calcitriol prophylaxis needs to be continued beyond 12 months. At the lumbar spine, there were no significant differences in BMD between groups. Over a period of 2 years, 22 new vertebral fractures/deformities occurred in 4 patients treated with calcium alone compared with one new vertebral fracture in 1 patient treated with calcitriol. Because the sample size was too low to provide reliable interpretation of vertebral fracture rates, this difference is likely a chance result. Mild hypercalcemia was common with calcitriol therapy, as was mild hypercalciuria (59% of patients vs. 10% controls), but there were no significant differences between groups in serum creatinine after 2 years. These data suggest calcitriol has a role in reducing proximal femur bone loss after cardiac or lung transplantation but treatment needs to be continued beyond 1 year.

Prospective study. Cardiac surgery ICU at a university hospital. Forty patients (34 men, 6 women) with a mean (+/- SD) age of 54.4+/-8.5 years after orthotopic heart transplantation. CI and preload measurements were performed with TDD and pulmonary artery catheters in the ICU at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h postoperatively. The femoral artery CI was compared with the pulmonary artery CI. Changes in the ITBVI, GEDVI, CVP, and PAOP were correlated with changes in the SVI. No difference was found between the femoral and pulmonary arterial CIs (r = 0.98 [bias, 0.35 L/min/m(2)]; p<0.01). There was no statistically significant correlation between changes in the SVI and changes in CVP (r = -0.23,) and PAOP (r = -0.06). However, the ITBVI (r = 0.65; p<0.01) and the GEDVI (r = 0.73; p<0.01) were significantly correlated to changes in the SVI. Changes in the same direction occurred between the SVI and the GEDVI as well as between the SVI and the ITBVI in 76.3% and 71.9% of patients, respectively, while CVP and PAOP also changed in the same direction as SVI in only 35.1% and 36.9% of patients, respectively. ITBVI and GEDVI are more reliable preload parameters than CVP and PAOP. Even in denervated hearts, ITBVI and GEDVI show significant correlations with SVI. The transpulmonary indicator dilution technique is promising and should be investigated further.

Early cardiac allograft failure (ECAF) was defined as acute allograft failure in the early transplant period. The aim of this study is to elucidate the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical characteristics and the role of apoptosis in ECAF in nine patients. We reviewed preoperative clinical data and morphological data at the time of autopsy or retransplantation. We also performed TUNEL assay and immunohistochemistry to study fibronectin and tubulin beta-II. The average recipient and donor age was 48 +/- 10.3 and 28 +/- 7.11 respectively. Seven patients died at a mean time of 26 hours. The remaining two patients underwent retransplantation and are alive. The mean cold ischemic time was 124. 1 +/- 44.5 minutes. No patient had a panel reactive antibody >15% and lymphocytic crossmatch was positive in one case. All cases had grade 2-3 of coagulative necrosis, which correlated positively with fibonectin accumulation in myocyte cytoplasm, and cytoplasmic tubulin loss (p < 0.05). TUNEL technique showed in all cases some degree of DNA strand breaks in cardiomyocytes. Endothelium DNA strand breaks were seen in seven cases. Patients transplanted because of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy had a significantly higher degree of DNA strand breaks in cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02) than those transplanted because of ischemic cardiomyopathy. These results indicate that ECAF may be caused by ischemic-reperfusion damage to the donor heart assessed by myocyte coagulative necrosis, fibronectin accumulation in myocytes, tubulin loss, and DNA strand breaks of cardiomyocytes and endothelium. The use of a combination of these techniques might be appropriate in the diagnosis of ECAF in endomyocardial biopsies when it is suspected clinically.

T cells have roles in the pathogenesis of native coronary atherosclerosis (CA) and transplant-associated coronary artery disease (TCAD). The mechanisms by which T cells interact with other cells in these lesions are not fully known. CD154 is an activation-induced CD4+ T cell surface molecule that interacts with CD40+ target cells, including macrophages and endothelial cells, and induces the production of pro-inflammatory molecules, including CD54 (ICAM-1) and CD106 (VCAM-1). To investigate whether CD154-CD40 interactions might be involved in the pathogenesis of CA or TCAD we performed immunohistochemical studies of CD154 and CD40 expression on frozen sections of coronary arteries obtained from cardiac allograft recipients with CA (n=10) or TCAD (n=9). Utilizing four different anti-CD154 mAb we found that CD154 expression was restricted to infiltrating lymphocytes in CA and TCAD. CD40 expression was markedly up-regulated on intimal endothelial cells, foam cells, macrophages and smooth muscle cells in both diseases. Dual immunolabeling demonstrated many CD40+ cells co-expressed CD54 and CD106. The extent of CD40, CD54 and CD106 expression showed statistical significant correlation with the severity of disease and the amount of intimal lymphocytes. Together these studies demonstrate the presence of activated CD154+ and CD40+ cells in both CA and TCAD lesions and suggest that CD154-mediated interactions with CD40+ macrophages, foam cells, smooth muscle cells and/or endothelial cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used for pediatric cardiac support in settings of expected mortality due to severe myocardial dysfunction. We reviewed the records of 34 children (<18 years) placed on ECMO between March 1995 and May 1999. Demographic, cardiac, noncardiac, and outcome variables were recorded. Data were subjected to univariate analysis to define predictors of outcome. Eighteen patients were placed on ECMO after cardiac surgery (Group A); seven of 18 were weaned off ECMO, and four survived to discharge (22%). Thirteen patients were placed on ECMO as a bridge to cardiac transplantation (Group B), six of 13 received a heart transplant, one recovered spontaneously, and six survived to discharge (46%). Three patients were placed on ECMO for failed cardiac transplantation while awaiting a second transplant (Group C); one recovered graft function, two received a second heart transplant, and two of three survived (66%). The primary cause of death was multiorgan system failure (68%). Group A patients supported on ECMO for more than 6 days did not survive. Mediastinal bleeding complications and renal failure requiring dialysis were associated with nonsurvival. We conclude that ECMO as a bridge to cardiac transplant was more successful than ECMO support after cardiotomy. Mediastinal bleeding and renal failure were associated with poor outcome.

Thirteen patients have undergone IABP placement using this technique. The average duration of IABP support was 37 days (range 10-86 days). Ten patients were successfully transplanted. All patients were allowed to sit, stand and ambulate with assistance. No neurologic complications occurred. There were no episodes of sepsis related to balloon or insertion site. No patient had limb ischemia during IABP counterpulsation. Left axillary artery IABP insertion via a vein cuff portal is a straightforward technique with minimal complications.

During the past 2 decades, heart transplantation has evolved from an experimental procedure to an accepted life-extending therapy for patients with endstage heart failure. However, with dramatic improvements in organ preservation, surgery and immunosuppressive drug management, short term survival is no longer the pivotal issue for most heart transplant recipients (HTR). Rather, a return to functional lifestyle with good quality of life is now the desired procedural outcome. To achieve this outcome, aggressive exercise rehabilitation is essential. HTR present unique exercise challenges. Preoperatively, most of these patients had chronic debilitating cardiac illness. Many HTR have had prolonged pretransplantation hospitalisation for inotropic support or a ventricular assist device. Decrements in peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) and related cardiovascular parameters regress approximately 26% within the first 1 to 3 weeks of sustained bed rest. Consequently, extremely poor aerobic capacity and cardiac cachexia are not unusual occurrences in HTR who have required mechanical support or been confined to bed rest. Moreover, HTR must also contend with de novo exercise challenges conferred by chronic cardiac denervation and the multiple sequelae resulting from immunosuppression therapy. There is ample evidence that both endurance and resistance training are well tolerated in HTR. Moreover, there is growing clinical consensus that specific endurance and resistance training regimens in HTR can be efficacious adjunctive therapies in the prevention of immunosuppression-induced adverse effects and the reversal of pathophysiological consequences associated with cardiac denervation and antecedent heart failure. For example, some HTR who remain compliant during strenuous long term endurance training programmes achieve peak heart rate and VO2peak values late after transplantation that approach age-matched norms (up to approximately 95% of predicted). These benefits are not seen in HTR who do not participate in structured endurance exercise training. Rather, peak heart rate and VO2peak values in untrained HTR remain approximately 60 to 70% of predicted indefinitely. However, the mechanisms responsible for improved peak heart rate, VO2peak and total exercise time are not completely understood and require further investigation. Recent studies have also demonstrated that resistance exercise training may be an effective countermeasure for corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis and skeletal muscle myopathy. HTR who participate in specific resistance training programmes successfully restore bone mineral density (BMD) in both the axial and appendicular skeleton to pretransplantation levels, increase lean mass to levels greater than pretransplantation, and reduce body fat. In contrast, HTR who do not participate in resistance training lose approximately 15% BMD from the lumbar spine early in the postoperative period and experience further gradual reductions in BMD and muscle mass late after transplantation.

A precise understanding of immunological mechanisms is needed to prevent transplant vasculopathy. The developing process of transplant vasculopathy was investigated by retransplanting rat cardiac allografts and measuring the expressions of 21 different genes inside the retransplanted allografts under nonimmunosuppressive conditions. Significant transplant vasculopathy developed if WKY hearts were grafted to LEW and retransplanted to WKY 5 days after the initial grafting, but it did not in allografts retransplanted 3 days after the initial grafting. The disease did not progress in retransplanted isografts or if nude rats were used as the initial recipients. However, the development of transplant vasculopathy was not affected by changing the second recipients to the F1 progeny of donor x recipient or to nude animals. Among the expressions of 21 different genes observed in allografts at 1, 14, 30, or 60 days after retransplantation, those of T-cell activation-related genes, such as interferon-y and Fas ligand, showed the earliest and the most dramatic difference between 3- and 5-day-retransplanted allografts whereas macrophage/monocyte activation-related genes showed little difference. Furthermore, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses of allografts retransplanted to nude animal indicated that T cells of the initial recipient origin survive and remain activated even 60 days after retransplantation. The T-cell response occurring between 3 and 5 days after grafting was identified as the critical parameter to the disease progression.

We designed a randomized trial to compare our empirical protocol for steroid dose adjustment with a novel protocol guided by EOS monitoring during the first 3 months after heart transplantation. Eighty patients were randomized to either have their EOS reported and used for steroid dose adjustment (RG; n=40), or not reported (NG; n=40). RG patients had their steroid dosage increased if EOS exceeded 0.06 x 10(9)/liter. RG patients had an 83% lower risk of treated rejection (P=0.035) and lower median intravenous dose of methyl-prednisolone (P=0.017) than NG during the first 6 postoperative weeks. The proportion of diagnostic increases in EOS that were followed within 2 weeks by treated rejection was 42% greater in NG than RG (P=0.0001), compatible with a direct impact of EOS-guided prednisolone dose adjustment on the risk of subsequent rejection. Overall, RG had less than half the risk of rejection of any grade (P<0.001) and significantly more rejection-free biopsies than NG (P=0.001). The mean oral prednisolone dosage was significantly greater in RG than NG during the first (P=0.014) and second (P=0.001) 6 weeks of follow-up. This did not increase the incidence of serious steroid-related side effects. EOS monitoring is a simple, cheap, and effective means of optimizing steroid immunosuppression. Restriction of the EOS-guided steroid dosing protocol to periods of prolonged hospitalisation during the first 3 postoperative months should limit the requirement for higher prednisolone dosage without affecting immunosuppressive efficacy.

Acute vascular xenograft rejection (AVXR), also termed delayed xenograft rejection (DXR), occurs when hyperacute rejection (HAR) is prevented by strategies directed at xenoreactive natural antibodies and/or complement activation. We have hypothesized that AVXR/DXR is initiated in part by early components of the complement cascade, notably C1q. We have developed synthetic peptides (termed CBP2 and WY) that interfere with the interaction between C1q and antibody. CBP2 and the WY-conjugates were used as inhibitors of immunoglobulin aggregate binding to solid phase C1q. Inhibition of complement activation by the peptides of the classical system was determined using lysis assays with sensitized sheep red blood cells or porcine aortic endothelial cells as targets and of the alternate complement pathway using guinea pig red blood cells as targets. Two transplant models were used to study the effects of administering peptides to recipients: rat heart transplant to presensitized mouse, and guinea heart transplant to PVG C6-deficient rats. CBP2 and WY-conjugates inhibited immunoglobulin aggregate binding to C1q. The peptides also inhibited human complement-mediated lysis of sensitized sheep red blood cells and porcine aortic endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner and the WY-conjugates prevented activation of the alternate complement pathway as shown by inhibition of guinea pig red blood cells lysis with human serum. In addition, the use of the peptides and conjugates resulted in significant prolongation of xenograft survival. The CBP2 and WY peptides exhibit the functional activity of inhibition of complement activation. These peptides also prolong xenograft survival and thus provide reagents for the study of the importance of C1q and other complement components in transplant rejection mechanisms.

The first months after orthotopic heart transplantation are associated with the highest risk of acute allograft rejection. This study explores the utility and reliability of linear and novel nonlinear metrics of heart rate variability as predictors of graft rejection. The underlying hypothesis is that the transplanted heart, in response to inflammatory mediators, alters the dynamic properties of its rhythm-generating system. In a cross-sectional study of 45 patients who had undergone heart transplantation, spanning a period of 4 months after the operation, heart rate variability was examined by time- and frequency-domain analysis. The nonlinear features of heart rate variability were studied by computing a pointwise correlation dimension of R-R interval time series. The results of heart rate variability analysis were compared with those of endomyocardial surveillance biopsy studies using the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation scoring system. Duration of heart transplantation itself exhibited a significant (P<.05) association with the onset of rejection. Specific predictors of acute rejection based on heart rate variability were identified, including shortening of the R-R interval (from 700 +/- 68 to 648 +/- 72 ms), an increase in the ratio of low-frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz) to high-frequency (0.15-0.40 Hz) spectral power (from 0.3 +/- 0.2 to 0.6 +/- 0.4), and a decrease in pointwise correlation dimension values (from 1.7 +/- 0.7 to 0.9 +/- 0.3 units). Multivariable logistic regression analysis (R (2) = 0.4) revealed that the only significant independent risk predictors were pointwise correlation dimension (odds ratio, 2.2 per 0.1 unit) and duration of heart transplantation (odds ratio, 1.7 per week).

The new immunomodulator 2-amino-2-(2-[4-octylphenyl]ethyl)-1,3-propanediol hydrochloride (FTY720) lowers the peripheral lymphocyte count (PLC) by inducing migration of circulating lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs. This effect is dose-dependent at low (up to 0.1 mg/kg per day) doses in rats. We investigated the correlation between PLC and the later rejection, when FTY720 was combined with RAD. Heterotopic cardiac grafting was performed using the DA-Lewis strain combination. FTY720 and RAD were administered as single daily doses by gavage alone and in combination starting 3 days before to 28 days after transplantation. Graft survival was monitored daily by palpation. PLC was determined at 1 and 4 weeks, body weight (BW) weekly. Histologic evaluation of grafted hearts was performed after rejection. FTY720 at doses of 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg per day prolonged graft survival dose-dependently from 6 (placebo) to 7, 9.5 and 15 days median survival time (MST). RAD at doses of 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg per day delayed rejection to 8.5, 18 and 37.5 days MST. Very small FTY720 doses added to the lower RAD doses were effective in maintaining grafts throughout the treatment period and with normal weight gain, as opposed to regimens with 1 mg/kg or more per day RAD, which resulted in delayed weight gain. FTY720 lowered the PLC significantly and dose-dependently. The PLC correlated well with graft survival [Spearman rank correlation (n = 30, rs = -0.75)]. Fully effective FTY720 + RAD combination regimens caused no side effects with respect to the rats' general well-being or weight gain and were better tolerated than equiactive RAD monotherapy, suggesting a broader therapeutic window for the combinations. Under the experimental conditions, the PLC decrease showed an interesting correlation with the anti-rejection effects in these two-drug regimens. Thus, in rats the PLC is helpful for monitoring the biological activity of FTY720 at low doses (< 0.1 mg/kg per day), i.e. in the range of the steep part of its dose-response relationship.

One of the most serious late complications of the intraatrial baffle procedure (Mustard or Senning correction) in patients suffering from transposition of the great arteries, (TGA) is the late systemic right ventricular failure. Nearly all patients presenting with right ventricular dysfunction have severe associated tricuspid regurgitation. The surgical options for these patients include tricuspid valve reconstruction or replacement, staged conversion to the arterial switch operation and orthotopic heart transplantation. Review of 189 operative survivors who underwent the Mustard or Senning operation for TGA between 1970 and 1993 in our institution revealed 12 patients (6.3%) who died from severe systemic right ventricular dysfunction (mean follow-up 16+/-3.5 years), which was the most common cause of late death. All of them had concomitant severe tricuspid regurgitation. 7 patients (3.7%) died from sudden cardiac death. The actuarial survival at 10 years is 93% for simple TGA and 85% for TGA associated with ventricular septum defect or coarctation. At our institution, 4 adolescent or adult patients underwent tricuspid valve surgery; tricuspid valve replacement was performed in 2 patients and valve repair in 2 patients. In the mid-term follow-up, 2 of these patients died. Two additional patients underwent orthotopic heart transplantation, and one died on the waiting list. Staged conversion from the Senning/Mustard atrial repair to the arterial switch operation was initially reported by Mee. The procedure for pulmonary artery banding starts with inducing left ventricular reconditioning with subsequent arterial switch. The mortality of this two-staged procedure was as high as 20% to 30% in our early experience, and some of the candidates underwent heart transplantation. Tricuspid valve repair or replacement do not improve right ventricular function in patients with a failing right ventricle following the Mustard/Senning operation.

Twenty-five patients were followed prospectively more than 3 years to document their growth and pubertal development. Parameters surveyed were clinical (height, weight, pubertal staging, and bone age) and biochemical (luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), IGF-1, and fasting insulin). At surgery, there were 18 boys and 7 girls aged 11 months to 17 years (median 13 years); 14 had congenital heart defects (CHDs) and 11 had a cardiomyopathy (CM). Immunosuppressive therapy included cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisone. Eighteen patients were still growing (15 boys, 3 girls): 8 had a retarded bone age and 6 with CHD had severe growth failure. Following surgery, most patients maintained their height within one sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) score of that initially observed. Patients reaching their target heights do so mainly in the lower range. Three patients not reaching target height had a CHD. Weight was greatest 1 year postoperatively (113 +/- 27% ideal body weight) with normalization at 2 years (100 +/- 18%). Of the 13 prepubertal patients, menarche occurred at age 12 in 1 girl, while 3 boys began puberty at age 12 years. In both sexes, serum levels of gonadotropins and IGF-1 increased during puberty, moderate hyperinsulinism was observed, and DHEAS levels decreased. Our results indicate that children and adolescents grow normally following cardiac transplantation and that they attain their target height despite a lack of catch-up growth. They gain weight significantly in the first postoperative year with normalization of their weight at 2 years. Furthermore, the clinical and biochemical indices of puberty are overall within the norms. However, the severity of growth delay at the time of transplantation inherent to the cardiac pathology has a major impact on adult height.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is widely used for postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock in children. However, the efficacy of ECMO for early post-heart transplant graft failure in infants has not been reported. Our aims were to determine: (1) the utility of ECMO in infants with severe donor-heart dysfunction, (2) predictors for requiring ECMO, and (3) the long-term outcome of surviving ECMO patients. All infants (age < 6 months at listing) undergoing heart transplantation were reviewed. Diagnostic categories were hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and non-HLHS (complex congenital heart disease and cardiomyopathies). Continuous and categorical comparisons were by Wilcoxon's rank sum test and Fisher's exact test respectively. 14 (12 HLHS, 2 non-HLHS) of 63 (46 HLHS, 17 non-HLHS) infants were placed on ECMO. Ten patients (71%) were successfully weaned from ECMO and 8 (57%) were discharged alive. All ECMO hospital survivors remain alive (mean follow-up 36.2 +/- 21.4 months, range 13.1-77.6 months). Mean duration of ECMO support was 68 hours in weaned patients vs 144 hours (p = 0.19) in nonweaned patients, and 64 hours in survivors vs 123 hours (p = 0.35) in nonsurvivors. ECMO deaths were due to sepsis (n = 3), intractable pulmonary hypertension (n = 2), and intracranial bleed (n = 1). Neurologic deficits occurred in 2 survivors. Median ICU and hospital stays for ECMO survivors were 29 and 33 days vs 7 (p = 0.0003) and 9 (p = 0.0004) days for non-ECMO patients. Age listed, age transplanted, wait time, body weight, donor/recipient weight ratio, total ischemia time, and diagnosis did not predict the need for ECMO. (1) ECMO is useful for post-heart transplant circulatory support in infants with early graft failure. (2) All survivors were weaned in fewer than 4 days. (3) Three-year survival of ECMO hospital survivors has been high, but neurologic complications are prevalent.

Glucocorticoid-induced cushingoid symptoms, including osteopenia and osteoporosis are well-documented in adult heart transplant recipients (HTR). Bone mineral density (BMD) of the axial skeleton is diminished by 10% to 20% within 60 days after transplantation (Tx) and most adult HTR fulfill World Health Organization criteria for osteoporosis (BMD > 2.5 SD below norm). At present, we do not know whether glucocorticoids have similar deleterious effects in adolescent HTR. To determine the consequences of glucocorticoid immunosuppression on regional bone mineral density (BMD) and biochemical markers of bone metabolism in adolescent HTR, we studied 19 patients (aged 16 +/- 3) at 19 months (group mean) after Tx. We measured BMD (hydroxyapatite g/cm(2)) of the total body, lumbar spine, and pelvis using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar). Serum levels of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and pyridinoline cross-links were determined by enzyme immunoassay in serum kits. The BMD of the lumbar spine (-12%), femur neck (-13%), femur trochanter (-12%), and ward's triangle (-16%) were significantly (p < 0.05) lower in adolescent HTR than age- and gender-matched norms. Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (29 +/- 6 vs 22 +/- 3 U/liter) and pyridinoline cross-links (5.3 +/- 1.1 vs 3.8 +/- 0.7 mmol/liter) were significantly (p < 0.05) elevated in adolescent HTR, compared with age- and gender-matched controls studied in our laboratory. Our cross-sectional results demonstrate that BMD of the axial skeleton in adolescent HTR is significantly lower (-10% to 20%) than age-matched norms and that serum biochemical markers of bone metabolism are significantly elevated, suggesting accelerated bone turnover.

To determine whether genetic factors are involved in the development of renal dysfunction due to cyclosporine nephrotoxicity, we analyzed 2 polymorphisms in the signal sequence of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 gene; codon 10 (Leu(10) --> Pro) and codon 25 (Arg(25) --> Pro). Using sequence specific oligonucleotide probing, we analyzed both TGF-beta1 gene polymorphisms in cardiac allograft recipients (n = 168) who survived at least 1 year with minimal follow-up of 7 years. Patients received cyclosporine and steroids as maintenance immunosuppressive therapy. Renal dysfunction was defined as a serum creatinine > or = 250 micromol/liter. Renal dysfunction was observed in 2% (3/168) of the patients at 1 year, in 7% (11/160) at 3 years, in 12% (18/152) at 5 years, and in 20% (26/131) at 7 years post-transplantation. The genotypic distributions for TGF-beta1 codon 10 were 7% Pro/Pro, 61% Pro/Leu, and 32% Leu/Leu, and for codon 25 these percentages were 1% Pro/Pro, 12% Pro/Arg, and 87% Arg/Arg. We found an association between the TGF-beta 1 genotype encoding proline at codon 10 and renal dysfunction. At 7 years post-transplantation, 26% (23/89) of the patients with the heterozygous Pro/Leu or homozygous Pro/Pro genotype had renal dysfunction vs only 7% (3/42) of the patients with the homozygous Leu/Leu genotype (p = 0.017). For the TGF-beta1 codon 25 genotypes, we found no association between TGF-beta 1 genotypes and renal dysfunction. Our data support the hypothesis that TGF-beta 1 is involved in the process leading to renal insufficiency in cyclosporine-treated cardiac allograft recipients. In these patients the presence of TGF-beta 1 Pro(10) might be a risk factor.

Several studies have explored the feasibility of using myocardial perfusion imaging to detect allograft vasculopathy after heart transplantation. We undertook the present prospective consecutive study to comparatively evaluate the role of serial myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanning and coronary arteriography (CAG) in detecting coronary artery stenosis suitable for coronary angioplasty in heart transplant recipients. Within a 2-week interval during a follow-up period of 5.6 (95% confidence limits 2.1 to 12) years, 255 serial CAGs and myocardial perfusion scintigraphies were performed in 67 patients. Arteriography and scintigraphy were performed once yearly after heart transplantation. We retrospectively analyzed the data. Myocardial scintigraphy showed pathologic reversible defects in 9 out of 67 patients. Four of these patients had significant (>50% and also >70%) focal segmental stenosis in the middle and proximal parts of the coronary arteries (Type A lesions), 1 had diffuse and circumferential narrowing in the distal parts (Type B lesions), whereas CAG showed no lesions in the remaining 4 patients. The patients with significant Type A lesions were revascularized with percutaneous coronary angioplasty. Coronary arteriography showed that 1 patient had extensive Type A and Type B lesions, whereas myocardial perfusion scans detected no. The predictive value of a negative (normal) SPECT was 98% (95% confidence limits 94% to 100%) for the detection of lesions suited for revascularization. Annual myocardial SPECT seems well suited to screen for significant coronary artery stenosis. A SPECT study without reversible defects virtually excludes lesions suitable for coronary artery revascularization.

Allospecific T cells are known to play a central role in the process of allograft rejection. Recently, it has been shown that T cell function could be specifically targeted using DNA vaccination. In our model, PCR analysis of the TCR-beta chain repertoire of T cells infiltrating rejected allografts showed specific expansions of the Vbeta13 and Vbeta2 families. In this study, we tested the effect on allograft survival of DNA vaccination against a specific TCR Vbeta, in a model of heart allograft rejection in adult rats. Our results showed that anti-TCR Vbeta13 DNA vaccination lead to a significant prolongation of allograft survival compared to vaccination against other Vbeta families or untreated recipients. The prolongation of allograft survival correlated in vitro with a decrease in anti-donor reactivity of spleen cells from Vbeta13-vaccinated rats. These results show that, in a transplantation model, DNA vaccination could be used as a method to specifically manipulate a T cell response and thus prolong allograft survival.

Mouse bone marrow-derived myeloid dendritic cells (DC) propagated in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) (so-called 'TGF-beta DC') are phenotypically immature, and prolong allograft survival. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) has been shown to inhibit the maturation of DC by down-regulating surface major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, co-stimulatory and adhesion molecule expression. Genetic engineering of TGF-beta DC to overexpress IL-10 might enhance their tolerogenic potential. In this study, adenoviral (Ad) vectors encoding the mouse IL-10 gene were transduced into B10 (H2b) TGF-beta DC. Transduction with Ad-IL-10 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50-100 resulted in a modest reduction in the incidence of DC expressing surface MHC class II, CD40, CD80 and CD86. Paradoxically, Ad-IL-10 transduction enhanced the allostimulatory activity of DC in mixed leucocyte reactions and cytotoxic T lymphocyte assays, and increased their natural killer cell stimulatory activity. Systemic injection of normal C3H recipients with Ad-IL-10-transduced B10-DC 7 days before organ transplantation, exacerbated heart graft rejection and augmented circulating anti-donor alloantibody titres. Contrasting effects were observed in relation to tumour growth. All mice preimmunized with Ad-IL-10-transduced, tumour antigen (B16F10)-pulsed DC developed palpable tumours, associated with significant inhibition of splenic anti-tumour cytotoxic T lymphocyte generation. Animals pretreated with control Ad-LacZ-transduced, B16F10-pulsed DC however, remained tumour free. These findings are consistent with the multifunctional immunomodulatory properties of mammalian IL-10.

Extracellular ATP and ADP may be important mediators of vascular inflammation and thrombosis. Nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (NTPDase or CD39) is a vascular ectoenzyme that hydrolyses ATP and ADP; however, this activity is lost during reperfusion injury. We show that the supplementation of NTPDase activity within xenograft vasculature using CD39 recombinant adenoviruses (AdCD39) has protective effects in vivo. Recombinant adenoviruses containing human CD39 or beta-galactosidase (Adbeta-gal) encoding genes were constructed. Hartley guinea pig coronary arteries were perfused ex vivo with University of Wisconsin solution containing 10(9) plaque-forming units of the recombinant adenovirus. Infected grafts were then implanted in the abdomen of complement depleted Lewis rats. NTPDase activities decreased in all grafts within the first 24 hr and subsequently recovered only in those hearts infected with AdCD39. Immunohistological examination of AdCD39-infected grafts confirmed successful CD39 gene transfer into the endocardium and macrovasculature. Expression of CD39 modestly prolonged graft survival (90.2+/-5.4 hr, mean+/-SD, n=5) when compared with Adbeta-gal-infected grafts (67.4+/-5.4 hr, P<0.005) and perfusion controls (66.4+/-5.2 hr; P<0.005). Recombinant adenoviral infection can induce expression of CD39 within cardiac xenografts and provide survival benefits in vivo. Our data show that ex vivo infection by recombinant adenovirus vectors can result in vascular expression of a potential therapeutic agent.

We elucidated the possible role of chimerism in skin and heart allograft tolerance using cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced tolerance. When C3H (H-2k; Thy1.2, Mls-1b) mice were i.v. primed with 1x10(8) spleen cells (SC) from H-2 matched AKR (H-2k; Thy1.1, Mls-1a) mice and then treated i.p. with 200 mg/kg of CP, the survivals of both AKR skin grafts and heart grafts (HG) were permanently prolonged in a tolerogen-specific fashion. After this treatment, a minimal degree of mixed chimerism, the clonal destruction of Mls-1a-reactive CD4+Vbeta6+ T cells in the periphery, and the clonal deletion of Vbeta6+ thymocytes were all observed. When AKR SC and 100 mg/kg CP were used for conditioning, the AKR HG were permanently accepted, but the survival of the AKR skin grafts was only mildly prolonged. The clonal destruction of CD4+Vbeta6+ T cells in the periphery and the intrathymic clonal deletion of Vbeta6+ thymocytes were induced in both the SC and the 100 mg/kg CP-treated C3H mice. A minimal degree of mixed chimerism was detectable at 4 and 12 weeks after AKR SC and 100 mg/kg CP treatment, and still did not disappear at 40 weeks. The degree of mixed chimerism induced with SC and 100 mg/kg CP was significantly lower than that with SC and 200 mg/kg CP during the observation. No posttransplant cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) was observed to develop, while both the Th1 type (interferon-gamma) and Th2 type (interleukin-4 and -10) cytokine expressions decreased in the AKR HG of the tolerant C3H mice treated with both AKR SC plus 200 mg/kg CP, and AKR SC plus 100 mg/kg CP. A second set of skin grafts from donor AKR mice survived for more than 100 days in a tolerogen-specific fashion in all C3H mice treated with AKR SC and 200 mg/kg CP and also accepted the AKR HG for over 200 days, while 80% of the C3H mice treated with AKR SC and 100 mg/kg CP and accepted the AKR HG for more than 200 days. These results strongly suggested the following conclusions: 1) the degree of chimerism can strongly influence the induction of skin and heart allograft tolerance, 2) posttransplant CAV does not develop in the donor HG maintained by chimerism-based CP-induced tolerance, 3) the mRNA expression of both Th1 and Th2 type cytokine decreased in the donor HG maintained by chimerism-based CP-induced tolerance, and 4) the induction of skin allograft tolerance is more difficult than the prevention of posttransplant CAV.

It has been proposed that hyperacute rejection (HAR) of pig-to-primate vascularized xenografts is due in large part to ineffective regulation of recipient complement by pig complement regulatory proteins (CRPs), and indeed transgenic expression of human CRPs in pigs can prevent hyperacute rejection. However, at least one pig CRP (CD59) efficiently regulates human complement in vitro, suggesting that it is the level of expression of a particular CRP(s) rather than cross-species incompatibility that explains the HAR of porcine xenografts. We investigated the relative effectiveness of transgenically expressed pig and human CD59 in providing protection of mouse hearts from human complement in an ex vivo setting. Transgenic mice expressing pig CD59 or human CD59 under the control of the human ICAM-2 promoter, which restricts expression in tissues to vascular endothelium, were used. Hearts from mice expressing similar levels of pig CD59 or human CD59 were perfused ex vivo with 10% human plasma and heart function was monitored for 60 min. Sections of perfused hearts were examined for deposition of the membrane attack complex (MAC). Control nontransgenic hearts (n=5) were rapidly affected by the addition of human plasma, with mean function falling to less than 10% of the initial level within 15 min. In contrast, hearts expressing either pig CD59 (n=6) or human CD59 (n=8) were protected from plasma-induced injury, maintaining 31 and 35% function, respectively, after 60 min of perfusion. MAC deposition was markedly reduced in both pig CD59 and human CD59 transgenic hearts compared to nontransgenic control hearts. When highly expressed on endothelium in transgenic mice, pig CD59 provided equivalent protection to human CD59 in a model of human complement-mediated xenograft rejection. Thus supranormal expression of endogenous porcine CRPs may be a feasible alternative to the expression of human CRPs in preventing HAR of pig-to-primate xenografts.

Current immunosuppressive protocols fail to prevent chronic rejection often manifested as graft vascular disease (GVD) in solid organ transplant recipients. Several new immunosuppressants including sirolimus, a dual function growth factor antagonist, have been discovered, but studies of drug efficacy have been hampered by the lack of a model of GVD in primates, as a prelude to clinical trials. As described earlier, we have developed a novel non-human primate model of GVD where progression of GVD is quantified by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Twelve cynomolgus monkeys underwent aortic transplantation from blood group compatible but mixed lymphocyte reaction-mismatched donors. To allow the development of GVD in the allograft, no treatment was administered for the first 6 weeks. Six monkeys were treated orally with sirolimus from day 45 after transplantation to day 105. Progression of GVD measured as change in intimal area from day 42 to 105 was halted in sirolimus-treated monkeys compared to untreated monkeys (P<0.001, general linear model). On day 105, the intimal area +/- SEM was 3.7+/-1.0 and 6.4+/-0.5 mm2, respectively (P<0.05, t test). The magnitude of allograft intimal area on day 105 correlated inversely with sirolimus trough levels (R2=0.67, P<0.05). Regression of the intimal area was seen in four of six sirolimus-treated monkeys, which was significantly different from the untreated monkeys (P<0.05). Our results in the first non-human primate model of GVD showed that treatment with sirolimus not only halted the progression of preexisting GVD but also was associated with partial regression. Sirolimus trough blood levels were correlated with efficacy. Therefore, sirolimus has the potential to control clinical chronic allograft rejection.

Patients with biliary tract disease were grouped as follows: group I, pretransplantation diagnosis and treatment; group II, pretransplantation diagnosis and posttransplantation treatment; group III, normal pretransplantation biliary tree with posttransplantation diagnosis and treatment; group IV, unknown pretransplantation biliary status with posttransplantation diagnosis and treatment. Comparison among groups was made with regard to ultrasound findings, presentation, indication for operation, procedure, and outcome.

All patients in group I (n = 11) underwent elective intervention without complication. Of the 14 patients (groups II through IV) undergoing posttransplantation operation, intervention was mandated by acute complications of biliary tract disease in 7. The mortality rate in these 7 patients was 29%. Cholecystectomy in the posttransplantation period is often required emergently and has a high mortality.

Because of the growing discrepancy between the availability of donor organs and the number of patients with end-stage heart disease who need heart transplantation, a larger proportion of patients waiting for a suitable donor heart require pre-operative mechanical circulatory assistance. The criteria for the selection and management of these patients as applied at Muenster University Hospital are reviewed. The study population consists of 631 patients referred to our center for transplantation between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1996. Two hundred ninety-seven patients were listed for transplantation and 157 were transplanted. Of 41 patients who underwent implantation of a ventricular assist device (n = 34, Novacor; n = 6, TCI HeartMate; n = 1, Medos), 39 received the device as a bridge to transplantation and 2 as permanent support. For the purpose of the analysis, the study population was divided into 3 groups (elective bridging, urgent bridging, emergency bridging) and compared with heart transplant candidates who did not require mechanical circulatory assistance. Patients who underwent elective or urgent assist-device implantation were younger and had greater hemodynamic compromise than the remainder of patients waiting for heart transplantation, as suggested by a higher functional class and lower mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, serum sodium, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure. Survival of patients who electively underwent implantation of an assist device was better than that of patients who were stable on the waiting list and did not undergo heart transplantation during follow-up.

Patients with giant cell myocarditis were identified from the Multicenter Giant cell Myocarditis Registry. Bridging to cardiac transplantation in the giant cell myocarditis patients who received a ventricular assist device was compared with bridging in the general population of heart failure patients, as reported in the literature.

We have demonstrated ex vivo (from voluntary pregnancy interruption samples) the protector role of the HLA-G molecule present on the surface of cytotrophoblast cells versus the lysis carried out by the decidual uterine NK cells. This occurs under semi-allogenic conditions (maternal uterine NK cells and their trophoblast counterparts), as well as in allogenic conditions (maternal uterine NK cells and trophoblast cells from different mothers), thus defining the absence of maternal rejection at the moment of the implantation of the fertilized egg during pregnancy. Moreover, the expression of HLA-G on the cytotrophoblasts permits migration in maternal circulation and infiltration of maternal tissue (particularly in the skin), thereby probably creating a general state of tolerance. In the context of heart transplantation, in preliminary studies, we show that the presence of HLA-G in cardiac biopsy tissue prelevated from grafted patients significantly reduces acute rejects and shows an absence of chronic rejects. In the tumour context, the expression of HLA-G protein at the surface of primitive melanoma and metastatic cells confers protection from NK and CTL lytic activity. This suggests that HLA-G expression may impede the elimination of malignant cells by anti-tumour immune effector cells, constituting a newly described mechanism by which tumour cells may evade immunosurveillance.

This \"memory effect\", we have observed by the autocorrelation and by the spectrum analysis of the values expressing the heartbeat acceleration variability (tachogram 24 h). The \"memory effect\" cannot be absolutely put down in heart transplanted recipients to interference or to the activity of the central and/or peripheral nervous system, because the heart transplanted is a denervated heart by definition. Moreover, an immediate regulating effect of hormonic factors in the short-term heartbeat regulation is not completely plausible. As already known, the heart transplanted responds to the emergency situation autonomously and autochthonously in proportion to the signals reaching it directly from the circle (vascular resistance, blood pressure, etc.). This implies the existence of functional memory that is likely to be inborn in the conduction system of the heart. Looking at the results of our research we can conclude: \"cor se ipse alit, se ipse movet, se ipse reget\" (it autonomously models itself to all the different modifications in the circle, it feeds itself as the organ propelling blood circulation and, if necessary, it carries on its kinetic activity autonomously).

After internal cardioversion, programmed stimulation showed bidirectional decremental conduction across the suture line with nearly equal atrioatrial interval, whereas the recipient atrium showed progressively delayed intra-atrial conduction.

Here we demonstrate a unique pattern of cellular FN expression in rat recipients of cardiac allografts rendered tolerant in an infectious manner with either nondepleting CD4 mAb or regulatory spleen cells. Unlike in rejecting controls, cellular FN in tolerant hosts was restricted to the graft vessels and no vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 or intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression could be found, supporting the role of FN in leukocyte sequestration at the graft site. The lack of myocardial FN in tolerant rats, despite dense macrophage infiltration, correlated with profound depression of Th1 (interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma) cytokines. Treatment with CD4-depleting mAb prevented tolerance induction and restored myocardial expression of FN in parallel with marked increase in the expression of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma mRNA/protein. Furthermore, connective segment-1 peptide-facilitated adjunctive blockade of FN-alpha4beta1 interactions in recipients conditioned with CD4 depleting mAb, significantly depressed intragraft expression of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma mRNA/protein. Hence, the lack of FN associated with infiltrating leukocytes plays an important role in the maintenance of tolerance in transplant recipients by depressing local expression of Th1 cytokines that otherwise facilitate acute graft rejection.

Both lack of agreement between observers and lack of agreement between serial, independent pullback procedures (repeatability), which can result in a variable intraluminal catheter position may limit the reproducibility of ICUS measurements. To evaluate the reproducibility of serial measurements of standard linear and area cross-sectional coronary dimensions in patients with non-obstructive transplant vasculopathy. We performed ICUS imaging of patients without angiographic evidence of obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease after heart transplantation. A 30 MHz phased-array transducer was used. Two independent pullbacks of the left anterior descending coronary artery were performed and recorded on CD-ROM for off-line quantitative analysis of the most severely diseased site. Agreement of observers and repeatability of serial measurements were calculated by the use of linear regression analysis and Bland-Altman plots. Regarding agreement of observers, correlation coefficients for intra-observer agreement ranged from r = 0.98 to r = 0.99; those for interobserver agreement ranged from r = 0.87 to r = 0.98. Serial measurements of the identical coronary artery cross-section within independent catheter pullback procedures were possible for 104 of 112 target lesions (92.90/%). Correlation coefficients ranged from r = 0.91 to r = 0.97 (for lumen diameter r = 0.91, for lumen area r = 0.93, for vessel diameter r = 0.91, for vessel area r = 0.97, for thickness of plaque r = 0.96 and for area of plaque 0.94). The mean difference of measurements was around zero for all parameters with SD from 0.13 to 0.4 mm for linear parameters and from 1.53 to 1.82 mm2 for area parameters. Serial intravascular ultrasound measurements are highly reproducible without any evidence of systematic error and a SD of differences of measurements beyond the maximal spatial resolution of currently available intravascular ultrasound catheters.

Cyclosporine is used in the prevention of allograft rejection. Owing to its narrow therapeutic index, regular monitoring of the whole blood levels of cyclosporine is required. We observed that immunoassays measured significantly higher cyclosporine levels than did high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) over time after transplantation. As cyclosporine metabolites cross-react even with immunoassays, this observation might be due to alterations of the cyclosporine metabolism. We analyzed cyclosporine metabolite concentrations in the early and in the late posttransplantation periods in 127 patients after kidney, bone marrow, heart-lung, and liver transplantation by HPLC and determined whole blood levels of cyclosporine by 4 immunoassays (enzyme-multiplied immunoassay [EMIT], cloned enzyme donor immunoassay [CEDIA], AxSYM [Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL], and TDx [Abbott Laboratories]). Despite reduced dose, we found significantly higher cyclosporine concentrations measured by the EMIT, AxSYM, and TDx assays in various patient groups. These results are due to the increased metabolite/cyclosporine ratio in the late posttransplantation period. In particular, the metabolites AM1 and AM19 increased significantly over time in bone marrow transplant recipients. Therefore, cyclosporine levels measured by immunoassays should be interpreted with caution.

A single oral intragastric administration of cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) conjugated to allogeneic thymocytes (ATC, 4 x 10(7) cells) under conditions allowing the CTB to bind the complex to GM1 ganglioside receptors was shown to be efficacious in inducing peripheral T cell tolerance associated with significant suppression of both primary and secondary accelerated rejection of heart allografts when tested in mice. Allogeneic in vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), in vitro cytotoxicity responses, and mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) by T cells from mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), popliteal lymph nodes (PLN), and spleen were significantly reduced in mice treated with the CTB-ATC conjugate, as were also the numbers of cells in these organs producing IL-2, IFN-gamma, or IL-4. In contrast, a marked increase in the production of IL-4 in Peyer's patches (PP) and of TGF-beta(1) in PLN was observed. The suppressive potential of T cells from PP and/or MLN after oral treatment with CTB-ATC was further evident by intraperitoneal transfer of such cells from CTB-ATC-treated animals to primed recipients, which led to marked suppression of both allogen-specific DTH and MLR responses. A critical role for PP in inducing peripheral tolerance after oral CTB-ATC treatment was indicated by the absence of tolerance induction in animals whose PP had been destroyed before treatment with CTB-ATC. The results indicate that the protection against allograft rejection by oral treatment with CTB-ATC is mediated by T cells and associated with a strong induction of IL-4 production at mucosal sites and TGF-beta(1) at the effector sites.

It is still not known whether persistent increases in functional residual capacity (FRC) and residual volume (RV) after lung transplantation are due to preexisting hyperinflation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of chronic lung hyperinflation on static lung volumes after heart/lung (HLT) and bilateral lung transplantation (BLT). Static lung volumes were measured in 33 patients before and at 6 month intervals for up to 3 yrs after HLT (n=25) or BLT (n=8). The preoperative diagnosis was cystic fibrosis in 25 patients and other chronic hyperinflated lung diseases in eight patients. After surgery, total lung capacity returned to predicted normal values but FRC and RV remained greater than expected for either the recipient or the donor. At 1 yr after surgery, mean+/-SD FRC and RV were 130+/-18% and 151+/-34% of the predicted values for the recipient (p<0.001), and these figures did not change significantly over time. Similar abnormalities were found in patients with and without cystic fibrosis. After transplantation for lung diseases producing chronic hyperinflation, there is a persistent increase in functional residual capacity and residual volume. This alteration is present in patients operated on for diseases developed in both childhood and adulthood and is not recovered over time. It may be due to irreversible changes in the structure of the ribcage.

Eleven patients were evaluated the first year after transplantation (10/11 no rejection). Ten of the 11 were reevaluated 1.2 +/- 0.3 years later (9/10 no rejection). Dobutamine stress echocardiography revealed the following: (1) baseline regional wall motion abnormalities in 80% that resolved in all, (2) increased heart rate and blood pressure, (3) no change in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, (4) decreased end-systolic diameter, (5) decreased wall stress and increased velocity of circumferential fiber shortening, (6) increased VCFcZ score (representing systolic left ventricular function), and (7) a decreased mitral passive-to-active filling ratio. Patients with rejection had abnormal VCFcZ scores at rest. Pediatric transplantation patients without rejection have baseline regional wall motion abnormalities. With DSE, the following are present: (1) resolution of wall motion abnormalities, (2) increased contractility independent of load, and (3) changes in diastolic parameters that reflect increased heart rate.

A total of 103 adult patients with end-stage CF awaiting lung or heart and lung transplantation (mean age [+/- SD], 26+/-7 years; 54 men) underwent Doppler echocardiography and arterial blood gas analysis (mean PaO(2), 54+/-10 mm Hg; mean PaCO(2), 47+/-8 mm Hg). The findings were compared to those of 17 healthy control subjects (mean age, 24+/-7 years; 13 men) who had no history of cardiac or pulmonary disease. All patients were in sinus rhythm with a mean tachycardia of 112+/-18 beats/min (control subjects, 76+/-16; p<0.0001) and had a cardiac output of 5.3 L/min (control subjects, 4.3 L/min; p<0.04). In the patient group, the left ventricular (LV) dimensions, systolic and diastolic function, and wall thickness were all within normal limits. The mean amplitude of long-axis excursion in patients was normal at the LV site, but that of the right ventricular (RV) free wall was significantly reduced as compared with control subjects (1.6+/-0.4 vs. 2.2+/-0.4 cm, respectively; p<0.001), which was found to correlate with the degree of hypoxemia (r = 0.63; p<0.02) and hypercapnia (r = -0.68; p<0.01). RV diastolic function, which was represented by the relative isovolumic relaxation time to cardiac cycle length, was longer in patients than in control subjects (8.7+/-4.8% vs. 5.0+/-3.0%, respectively; p<0.03).

A prospective observational study using intravascular ultrasound. Two university hospitals. Changes in focal plaque, lumen, and total vessel area (worst site method) were assessed at baseline and after 12.1 (2.8) months (mean (SD)) of follow up in a cohort of 96 patients (79 male, 17 female; mean age 48.7 (9.6) years; time post-transplant 26.0 (32.4) months).

To investigate the role of these mutations in the pathogenesis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Case-control and prospective cohort study of patients attending a cardiomyopathy unit in a tertiary referral cardiac centre. 207 unrelated white patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, followed up for 259 patient years, and 200 controls were tested for HFE C282Y and H63D mutations by polymerase chain reaction and restriction digestion. 31/207 patients (15%) v 24/200 controls (12%) carried C282Y (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.2 (95% confidence interval 0.7 to 2.2)), 74/207 (36%) v 53/200 (27%) carried H63D (OR 1.6 (1.1 to 2.5)), and 10/207 (4.8%) v 4/200 (2%) were compound heterozygotes (OR 2.6 (0.8 to 8.5)). Four patients and six controls were H63D homozygous and one was C282Y homozygous.

The mechanism through which nitric oxide (NO) mediates cardiac myocyte death during acute cardiac rejection has not been fully delineated. We sought to determine whether NO promotes myocardial apoptosis and contributes to graft failure during acute cardiac rejection in a murine model. Heterotopic cardiac transplantation was performed from Balb/c (H-2d) to C3H/He mice (H-2k). Recipients were treated with aminoguanidine (AG) at 400 mg/kg every day after surgery. As references, we used isografts in Balb/c mice with and without AG treatment (400 mg/kg/day). Graft survival, histological changes and serum NO levels were assessed. Intra-graft apoptosis was evaluated using a DNA fragmentation detection assay (TUNEL method) and DNA laddering. Significant prolongation of graft survival was observed in allografts treated with AG in comparison with nontreated allografts. Serum NO levels, which peaked on day 7 in nontreated allografts, were significantly decreased in AG-treated allografts. AG treatment decreased the number of apoptotic cells and lowered the ratio of the apoptotic cardiac myocytes in contrast to that of the apoptotic infiltrating cells. DNA laddering was clearly detected in nontreated allografts but was suppressed in AG-treated allografts. Inhibition of NO production by AG prolonged murine cardiac allograft survival. The decrease in intra-graft apoptotic activity paralleled histological improvement. Cardiac myocyte death which occurs through an apoptotic process mediated by NO contributes to graft failure during acute cardiac rejection.

Regulation of myocardial Na, K-ATPase gene expression by thyroid hormone was investigated in the heterotopically transplanted rat heart to distinguish the direct effects of the hormone on the heart from effects secondary to increased hemodynamic workload. In this model, the transplanted heart is histologically normal and spontaneously beating, but hemodynamically unloaded. Three days after transplantation, relative contents of ventricular Na, K-ATPase alpha2- and beta1-mRNAs and alpha1- and alpha2-proteins were increased twofold to threefold in the transplanted heart, but these changes were transient. We next determined the maximal triiodothyronine (T3)-induced changes that are observed in various parameters of Na, K-ATPase expression in the heart: treatment of nontransplanted euthyroid rats with T3 to reach hyperthyroid steady state resulted in significant increases in heart weight, RNA and RNA/protein ratio, Na, K-ATPase activity, Na, K-ATPase alpha2-protein and enzyme activity, and approximately threefold increase in both alpha2- and beta1-mRNA content. The effect of treatment with thyroxine (T4) on the heterotopically transplanted and the in situ heart was then examined. T4 treatment (of the host) resulted in a significant increase in Na, K-ATPase alpha1-, alpha2-, and beta1-mRNAs in transplanted hearts (1.6 +/- 0.1-, 2.4 +/- 0.2-, and 1.7 +/- 0.1-fold, respectively), that was associated with a 2.2 +/- 0.2-fold increase in alpha2 protein as compared to transplanted hearts in diluent-treated euthyroid hosts (p < 0.05 for all changes). In addition, T4-induced increments in transplanted hearts were similar to those observed in the corresponding in situ hearts of host rats treated with T4. We conclude that the increase in Na, K-ATPase expression by thyroid hormone largely occurs independently of increased cardiac work elicited by the hormone and reflects a direct action of the hormone on Na, K-ATPase gene expression.

Cardiac isografts or allografts obtained on Day 5 after transplantation were perfused with Krebs bicarbonate buffer with or without various antidotes for NO or O(2)-, including N(omega)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; 1 mM), 2-phenyl-4,4,5, 5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO; 100 microM), 4-amino-6-hydroxypyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (AHPP; a xanthine oxidase inhibitor; 100 microM), and superoxide dismutase (SOD; 100 units/ml). Treatment of the cardiac allografts with PTIO showed most remarkable improvement of the cardiac injury as revealed by significant reduction in aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine phosphokinase concentrations in the perfusate. Similar but less potent protective effect on the allograft injury was observed by treatment with L-NMMA, AHPP, and SOD. Immunohistochemical analyses for iNOS and nitrotyrosine indicated that iNOS is mainly expressed by macrophages infiltrating the allograft tissues, and nitrotyrosine formation was demonstrated not only in macrophages but also in cardiac myocytes of the allografts, providing indirect evidence for the generation of peroxynitrite during allograft rejection. Our results suggest that tissue injury in rat cardiac allografts during acute rejection is mediated by both NO and O(2)(-), possibly through peroxynitrite formation.

Although various techniques have been explored for the detection and quantification of allograft transplant rejection, a practical and reliable method that is noninvasive is still elusive.

Allogeneic transplants (DA to Brown Norway) were performed with and without cyclosporine A (INN: ciclosporin) treatment, with syngeneic transplants (Brown Norway to Brown Norway) serving as controls (n = 6 per group). Magnetic resonance images were obtained with a gradient echo method before and after injection of ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide particles. At day 5, allogeneic transplants without cyclosporine A treatment showed a grade 4 rejection histologically. A significantly lower magnetic resonance signal was seen 24 hours after injection of ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide particles compared with the preinjection image (346 +/- 7.6 vs 839 +/- 43.4 arbitrary units; P <. 05). Syngeneic transplants showed no evidence of rejection histologically and no differences in magnetic resonance imaging signals between the images before and after injection of ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (863 +/- 18.8 vs 880 +/- 22.5). Allotransplants treated with cyclosporine A showed a grade 2 rejection histologically. The change in magnetic resonance signals in that group was small but showed a significant decrease in signal intensity after injection (646 +/- 10.5 vs 889 +/- 23.5, P <.05).

Respiratory rate was fixed at 0.25 Hz. We simultaneously recorded surface electrocardiogram, finger blood pressure, respiration and neck pressure signals while patients rested in the supine position. Time series of RR intervals, respiration, and neck and blood pressures were generated and subjected to spectral analysis. All patients demonstrated a 0.25-Hz peak in RR-interval spectrum, caused by non-autonomic respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Thirteen patients (5. 2 +/- 3.5 years after HTx; range, 0.9 to 10.2 years) showed a baroreflex-induced sharp peak at 0.1 Hz in RR-interval power spectrum during 0.1-Hz neck suction, indicating sympathetic reinnervation. However at 0.2-Hz neck suction, 4 of the 13 sympathetically reinnervated patients displayed a baroreflex-induced 0.2-Hz peak, which could be suppressed with atropine administration-strong evidence for vagal reinnervation.

Multiple regression analyses, controlling for education and race, indicated that neuropsychologic tests accounted for between 34% and 67% of the variance across IADL domains (e.g., cooking, household chores, medication management). The IADL capacity was most consistently predicted by long-standing verbal ability (Shipley Institute of Living Scale-Vocabulary, SILS-VOC) and psychomotor speed and mental flexibility (Trail Making Test-Part B, TMT-B).

In contrast, 72 patients (32.9%) had pretransplant anti-HLA antibodies detectable by FlowPRA (34 patients with only class I antibodies; 7 patients with only class II antibodies; 31 patients with both class I and class II antibodies). A highly significant association (P<0.001) was observed between pretransplant HLA antibodies detected by FlowPRA and episodes of rejection that occurred during the first posttransplant year. Fifteen patients died within the first year posttransplant. Of nine retrospective flow cytometric cross-matches that were performed, two were in recipients who had no pretransplant antibodies detectable by FlowPRA. Both of these cross-matches were negative. In contrast, five of seven cross-matches were positive among recipients who had FlowPRA detectable pretransplant antibodies. Posttransplant serum specimens from 91 patients were also assessed for antibodies by FlowPRA. Among this group, 58 patients had FlowPRA antibodies and there was a trend (although not statistically significant) for a biopsy documented episode of rejection to have occurred among patients with these antibodies. Collectively, our data suggest that pre- and posttransplant HLA antibodies detectable by FlowPRA and not AHG-CDC identify cardiac allograft recipients at risk for rejection. Furthermore, a positive donor reactive flow cytometric cross-match is significantly associated with graft loss. Thus, we believe that detection and identification of HLA-specific antibodies can be used to stratify patients into high and low risk categories. An important observation of this study is that in the majority of donor:recipient pairs, pretransplant HLA antibodies were not directed against donor antigens. We speculate that these non-donor-directed antibodies are surrogate markers that correspond to previous T cell activation. Thus, the rejection episodes that occur in these patients are in response to donor-derived MHC peptides that share cryptic determinants with the HLA antigens that initially sensitized the patient.

In vitro studies of the mode of action of cyclosporine (CsA) and tacrolimus have indicated that both drugs produce immunosuppression by a quite similar cellular and molecular mechanism to block T cell receptor emanated transcriptional activation of interleukin(IL)-2 and other cytokine genes. Herein, we show that there are distinct patterns of cytokine gene expression in rat heart allografts under equivalent effective doses (\"optimal dose\") of CsA and tacrolimus. The optimal doses of CsA (10 mg/kg/day) and tacrolimus (3.2 mg/kg/day), which induce similar mean graft survival time (MST), were administered in LEW recipients with ACI heart grafts from day 0 after grafting until sacrifice. Heart grafts were harvested at days 3, 5, and 7. The expression of various cell surface markers, cytokines, and cytotoxic factors was determined by immunohistology and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RFT-PCR). Cell populations that stained positively in the heart tissues of allograft control increased through day 7 for CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, NKR-Pla+ natural killer (NK) cells, and ED2+ macrophages. CsA and tacrolimus have comparable activity to block these cell local infiltrations. The mRNA levels of the majority of the factors were dramatically up-regulated in the allografts over time, peaking at day 5. The optimal doses of CsA and tacrolimus had similar inhibitory effects on Th1 type cytokine IL-2 and interferon [INF]-gamma), inflammatory cytokine (IL-1beta and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha), and cytotoxic factor (granzyme B and perforin) mRNA expression. However, the drugs had different effect on Th2 type cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10). Whereas IL-4 expression was not affected by tacrolimus and was enhanced by CsA, IL-10 expression was more significantly suppressed by tacrolimus than CsA. Differences in the suppression of Th2 type cytokine gene expression indicate that the in vivo molecular networks by which CsA and tacrolimus exert their full immunosuppressive activity are not necessarily the same.

To determine factors affecting the population pharmacokinetics of oral cyclosporin (CsA) in cardiac allograft recipients during the first 3 weeks after surgery. Data were obtained from routine trough monitoring and from two extra samples drawn during a dosing interval on a randomly selected day. Whole blood CsA concentrations were assayed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Approximately equal numbers of patients were prescribed Sandimmun (SAN) or Neoral (NEO) CsA formulations. Parameter values of a one-compartment kinetic model with first-order absorption and elimination were sought together with the inter-patient and intra-patient variances using the NONMEM program. Improved fits resulted from using the following expression in the model to adjust apparent bioavailability as a function of post-operative day (POD): f= 0.2 + 10 x ABS (POD-5)/[(POD + 7) x 60]. The CsA clearance (CL/f) was found to be influenced by current body weight (WT). There was an absorption lag time of about 35 min with SAN, but zero lag time with NEO. Oral bioavailability (f) was increased by about 35% with concomitant diltiazem and about 18% with NEO. The CL/f was 10% higher during the daytime than at night. The final pharmacokinetic model was validated using 200 bootstrap samples of the original data. Using a validated population modelling approach, it was found that a number of factors influence the pharmacokinetics of CsA during the early postoperative period in cardiac transplant patients. These influences affecting oral bioavailability and clearance may need to be taken into account for maintaining appropriate concentrations of CsA in the bloodstream.

Understanding the immunologic effects of hepatocytes is critical because of the potential to use these cells for bioartificial livers, as a vehicle for gene transfer, and as a means to induce donor-specific immunosuppression in organ transplantation. However, this understanding is complicated by the fact that hepatocytes express membrane-bound and soluble forms of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen, each with the potential to induce different immune responses. In the present study we first determined the immunologic effect of normal donor-derived hepatocytes in a rat heart transplant model. We then used ex vivo hepatocyte gene transfer to examine the immunologic effects of different forms of hepatocyte-expressed MHC class I antigen. Results showed that intrasplenic injection of purified, donor-strain-specific hepatocytes into recipients primes alloimmunity, as evidenced by acceleration of heart allograft rejection. Interestingly, injection of autologous hepatocytes transfected ex vivo with DNA encoding only membrane-bound donor MHC class I antigen (RT1.A(a)) also accelerated allograft rejection. However, hepatocytes transfected to express only secreted donor MHC antigen prolonged transplant survival. Limiting-dilution analysis of lymphocytes from animals treated with hepatocytes producing only secreted alloantigen showed an antigen-specific reduction in cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and helper T lymphocyte (HTL) precursors. Further analysis of CTL populations by flow cytometry revealed a relatively high percentage of nonviable cells, implying that soluble antigen promotes allospecific CTL death. In summary, this study suggests that hepatocyte-expressed MHC class I molecules have opposing immunologic effects, with the membrane-bound antigen inducing immunologic sensitization, and the soluble antigen promoting donor-specific immunosuppression.

Today, a wide array of devices is available to provide increasing levels of circulatory support. When used as bridges to heart transplantation, long-term circulatory support systems are a reliable means of keeping heart-failure patients alive as they await suitable donor hearts. Initially, transplant candidates who were receiving this type of support were unable to leave the hospital; today, however, because of advances in mechanical support technology and the portability of the current systems, these patients may return to their homes and even to their jobs while awaiting transplantation. Although heart transplantation may now be considered a routine procedure, the demand for donor hearts will always outweigh the supply, creating a definite need for long-term mechanical circulatory support. Already, clinical trials are underway to test the effectiveness of left ventricular assist devices as long-term support.

It is estimated that in the United States 30,000 patients with end-stage heart disease are eligible for heart transplantation, although less than 2500 are actually performed each year. As the population ages, several thousand other patients who are ineligible for cardiac transplantation will be left with limited options. Surgical strategies aimed at halting the progression of heart failure have therefore been devised. High-risk coronary artery bypass grafting can improve ejection fraction and alleviate heart failure symptoms in appropriately selected patients. Mitral valve repair and ventricular aneurysm resection/plication procedures may improve heart failure by decreasing the volume load on the left ventricle. Myoreduction operations (Batista operation) aim to improve the volume and wall stress relationship of the dilated left ventricle, but their clinical application has remained experimental.

The application of gene transfer technologies to the field of solid organ transplantation is uniquely appealing due to open access to the donor organ at the time of removal and the need for a local biological effect limited to the allograft. The objectives of gene transfer technology in the field of experimental heart transplantation include: firstly, modification of allograft phenotype and secondly, modulation of the host alloimmune response. Both objectives can theoretically decrease or eliminate the need for lifelong immunosuppression with its attendant risks. This article will review the principles and current methodology of gene transfer technology, applications of gene transfer technology to allo- and xeno- transplantation and the current status of clinical trials on gene therapy.

We have previously described the rejection of Gal+ mouse hearts by mice lacking Gala(1,3)Gal (Gal-/-) and demonstrated this to be a model of xenogeneic hyperacute rejection (HAR) which would occur in pig-to-human/primate xenotransplantation, where Gal+ antibody (Ab) and complement (C') mediate HAR. To reduce the amount of Gal present we used fucosyl transferase (H) as a transgene, H transferase competes for the same substrate as Gal transferase and reduces Gal expression by >90%. Gal-/- mice received a heart graft from C57BL/6 Gal+ or H transgenic mice and additional Gal Ab and C' provided; HAR was monitored by direct observation for up to 90 min, or by palpation thereafter. When grafts were rejected they were examined macro- and microscopically. H transgenic mice were used as donors to Gal-/- mice; it was found that: 1) C57BL/6 or H transgenic hearts were not rejected by Gal-/- recipients within 90 min in the absence of additional Gal Ab. 2) If additional Gal Ab and C' were provided as fresh normal human serum (NHS), Gal+ (C57BL/6) grafts were rejected by Gal-/- mice in approximately 34 min, whereas H transgenic hearts mostly lasted up to 17 hr, but were then rejected. The histological appearances showed features of both Arthus and Shwartzmann phenomena. 3) Mice hyperimmunized with Gal with anti-Gal titers of >1:20,000, rejected Gal+ grafts in 31 min; the survival was prolonged to 75 min with the H transgenic hearts. The presence of the H transgene in donor hearts transplanted to naive Gal-/- mice delays the onset of HAR, but rejection ultimately occurs; if the mice are hyperimmune earlier rejection occurs. The expression of the H transgene alone is insufficient to avoid HAR in the Gal-/- mouse model; the presence of other transgenes and techniques will be required to give an appropriate increase in survival of pig-to-human/primate grafts.

Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a major cause of morbidity in transplant patients. Early diagnosis and treatment have been shown to improve outcome. We evaluated the suitability of CMV immediate early, early, and late gene expression detected by nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) as markers of CMV infection. Blood samples were taken immediately before transplant and every one to two weeks after transplantation for 12 weeks from 50 patients undergoing thoracic organ transplantation. CMV-NASBA was performed and results compared with serology, CMV pp65 antigenaemia (CMV-AG) and the development of clinical CMV infection. Patients received \"preemptive\" anti-CMV therapy with ganciclovir based on the CMV-AG results. CMV immediate early and early gene expression were detected in 87 and 47%, respectively, of patients without other evidence of CMV infection. CMV late gene expression had a sensitivity of 97% for infection (compared with 83% for CMV-AG P=0.06) and a specificity of 93% (compared with 100% P=NS). Late gene expression occurred at the same time as CMV antigenaemia but 1.1 weeks earlier than the threshold of antigenaemia (CMV-AG>10) used to initiate preemptive therapy. NASBA provided a standardized tool for the detection of CMV transcripts with a greater sensitivity than the standard antigenemia test. Detection of immediate early and early gene transcripts was not specific for subsequent infection. CMV late gene expression determined by NASBA was an accurate and early marker of CMV infection. Detection of CMV late gene expression could be used to trigger \"preemptive\" anti-CMV therapy.

Donor brain death upregulates expression of inflammatory mediators in the heart. It is hypothesized that these nonspecific changes trigger and amplify acute rejection in unmodified recipients compared with hearts from normal living donors. We examined the inflammatory and immunological consequences of gradual-onset donor brain death on cardiac allografts after transplantation. Functioning hearts were engrafted from normotensive donors after 6 hours of ventilatory support. Hearts from brain-dead rats (Fisher, F344) were rejected significantly earlier (mean+/-SD, 9. 3+/-0.6 days) by their (Lewis) recipients than hearts from living donor controls (11.6+/-0.7 days, P=0.03). The inflammatory response of such organs was accelerated, with rapid expression of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules and brisk infiltration of associated leukocyte populations. Upregulation of major histocompatibility class II antigens increased organ immunogenicity. Acute rejection evolved in hearts from brain-dead donors more intensely and at a significantly faster rate than in controls. Donor brain death is deleterious to transplanted hearts. The resultant upregulation of inflammatory factors provokes host immune mechanisms and accelerates the acute rejection process in unmodified hosts.

STAT4(-/-) mice have impaired type 1 T cell differentiation, whereas STAT6(-/-) mice fail to generate type 2 responses. The role of type 1 and type 2 T cell differentiation in acute cardiac allograft rejection and in the induction of tolerance was examined in wild-type, STAT4(-/-), and STAT6(-/-) recipients. All recipients rejected the grafts promptly. Analysis of in situ cytokine gene expression in the allografts confirmed decreased levels of IFN-gamma in STAT4(-/-) recipients and undetectable levels of IL-4 and IL-5 in STAT6(-/-) mice. Blockade of the CD28/B7 costimulatory pathway prolonged cardiac graft survival for >100 days in 100% of wild-type and STAT4(-/-) mice. However, 14% of CTLA4-Ig-treated STAT6(-/-) mice rejected their grafts between 20 and 100 days. Moreover, of those animals followed past 100 days, 60% of the STAT6(-/-) mice rejected their grafts. Splenocytes harvested on day 145 posttransplant from CTLA4-Ig-treated rejecting STAT6(-/-) recipients were transfused into syngeneic SCID mice transplanted with donor or third party cardiac allografts. Both donor and third party grafts were rejected, indicating that the initial graft loss may be due to an immunological rejection. In contrast, when splenocytes from CTLA4-Ig-treated wild-type or nonrejecting STAT6(-/-) mice were transferred into SCID recipients, donor allografts were accepted, but third party hearts were rejected. Thus, long-term prolongation of cardiac allograft survival by CTLA4-Ig is STAT4-independent but, at least in part, STAT6-dependent. These data suggest that the balance of type 1 and type 2 T lymphocyte differentiation is not critical for acute rejection but influences the robust tolerance induced by CD28/B7 blockade in this model.

Two days after discontinuation of the cyclosporine, the child's condition improved dramatically, including an improved level of consciousness, and she became seizure free. By 6 weeks, she was fully ambulatory. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalograms demonstrated significant improvement. This patient had drug-induced neurotoxicity, exacerbated by hypomagnesemia.

Concentrations of total carnitine (TC), free carnitine (FC), short-chain acylcarnitines, long-chain acylcarnitines (LCAC) as well as carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) activities were measured in myocardial tissue homogenates and referred to the concentration of non-collagen protein. Compared to controls, the concentrations of TC and FC as well as total CPT activities were significantly lower in patients. LCAC levels and the LCAC to FC ratio values were significantly greater in patients than in controls. While the malonyl-CoA sensitive fraction of CPT, which represents CPT I activity, was similar in patients and controls, the residual CPT activity after inhibition by malonyl-CoA, representing CPT II activity, was significantly reduced in patients compared to controls. Moreover, the activity of CPT in the presence of Triton X-100, which also represents the activity of CPT II, was significantly lower in patients than in controls. Malonyl-CoA concentrations required for half-maximal inhibition of CPT activity were significantly greater in patients than in controls. There was a linear relationship between ejection fraction (EF) values and concentrations of TC, FC, or total CPT activities. Values for LCAC and the LCAC to FC ratio were inversely related to EF values.

Since it is of great importance to distinguish between a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and an infection caused by microbes especially after heart transplantation (HTX), we examined patients following heart surgery by determining procalcitonin (PCT), because PCT is said to be secreted only in patients with microbial infections. Sixty patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and 14 patients after heart transplantation were included in this prospective study. In the CABG group we had 30 patients without any postoperative complications (group A). Furthermore we took samples of 30 patients who suffered postoperatively from a sepsis (group B, n=15) or a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (C, n=15). In addition we measured the PCT-levels in 65 blood samples of 14 patients after heart transplantation (Group I: rejection > IIa, II: viral infection (CMV), III: bacterial/fungal infection, IV: controls). In all patients of group A the pre- and intraoperative PCT-values and the measurement at arrival on intensive care unit (ICU) were less than 0.2 ng/ml. On the second postoperative day the PCT-value was 0.33+/-0.15 ng/ml in the control group. At the same time it was 19.6+/-6.2 ng/ml in sepsis and 0.7+/-0.4 ng/ml in systemic inflammatory response syndrome patients (P<0.05).

These results show that extracorporeal circulation (ECC) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome do not initiate a PCT-secretion. Septic conditions cause a significant increase of PCT. In addition, PCT is a reliable indicator concerning the essential differentiation of bacterial or fungal--not viral--infection and rejection after heart transplantation.

TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and ultrastructure. Four guinea pig hearts were heterotopically transplanted to rats and four hamster hearts to sensitized rats by the modified technique of Ono and Lindsey. In the hamster-to-rat model, the rats were treated with a hamster skin tissue at two weeks before transplantation. Rejection of the grafts was diagnosed from cessation of the graft heart contraction. Immunohistochemically, C3 was deposited along all vessels including coronary vessels, arterioles, venules and capillaries, and IgM was deposited along major vessels in the guinea pig grafts; it was vice versa in the hamster grafts. In the guinea pig grafts, TUNEL showed positive staining in endothelial cells and myocytes, whereas no positive signal was shown in the rejected hamster hearts. Transmission electron microscopy revealed platelet aggregations in the vessels of guinea pig-to-rat and hamster-to-sensitized rat cardiac xenografts. In the guinea pig-to-rat cardiac xenografts, capillary walls were thin with a high electron density and the number of pinocytotic vesicles was reduced. Also several nuclei of the endothelial cells showed pyknosis and some nuclei were fragmented. On the other hand, these findings were not typical in the hamster-to-sensitized rat cardiac xenografts. In conclusion, this study revealed thromboembolism of capillaries and impairment of the endothelial cells in the hyper-acutely rejecting cardiac xenografts. Apoptosis of myocytes and endothelial cells was shown to be involved only in the hyper-acutely rejecting guinea pig-to-rat cardiac xenografts. These results indicated variability in hyper-acute rejection.

The early and reliable diagnosis of allograft rejection is a difficult task and the assessment of cytokine expression in the grafts can be a helpful parameter. We have compared competitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with intracellular cytokine staining by flow cytometry as tools to measure cytokine expression in rejecting and nonrejecting murine cardiac allografts. Both techniques gave comparable results for cytokine expression in rejecting allografts and syngeneic controls. Grafts from mice pretreated with anti-CD4 antibody and donor-specific blood transfusion showed a marked reduction in cytokine expression, as assessed by competitive RT-PCR, even though a cellular infiltrate was present in the graft. In contrast, the cytokine production measured by intracellular cytokine staining of the isolated graft-infiltrating cells was high and exceeded even that of the rejecting allografts. We conclude that intracellular cytokine staining of graft-infiltrating leukocytes by flow cytometry does not necessarily reflect accurately the cytokine milieu in the graft. This technique might therefore have a limited clinical application in contrast to competitive RT-PCR for the differentiation between graft acceptance and graft rejection.

Transplant arteriopathy is the major factor limiting long-term survival after cardiac transplantation. We have previously demonstrated that liposome-mediated gene delivery of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) to donor hearts reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury by blocking NFkappaB activation, adhesion molecule expression, and leukocyte infiltration. In this study, we used gene transfer of eNOS in a rabbit carotid transplant model to see whether these same effects would similarly ameliorate transplant arteriopathy. Liposomes complexed to the gene encoding eNOS were injected into donor carotid arterial segments that were transplanted orthotopically into recipient carotid arteries (n = 10). Controls included transplanted carotids transfected with liposomes complexed to empty plasmids (no functional gene) (n = 4) and transplanted carotids treated with saline (n = 6). Transplanted arteries were harvested for processing at 21 days. Intima/media (I/M) area ratios were calculated by computerized image analysis. Infiltrating T-lymphocytes and macrophages, and expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were quantified on immunocytochemistry. The I/M ratio was significantly reduced in eNOS-transfected arteries compared with arteries transfected with empty plasmids and saline-treated controls. Compared to transplanted control arteries, eNOS-transfected arteries demonstrated significantly reduced T-cell infiltration into the intima and significantly reduced macrophage infiltration into the media. Cell surface expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were both reduced in eNOS-transfected arteries. ENOS gene delivery can suppress neointimal lesion formation and T-lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration in transplanted arteries, associated with a reduction in relevant adhesion molecule expression. Thus, gene therapy with eNOS may not only reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury but may also ameliorate transplant arteriopathy in transplanted hearts.

Surgical and ischemic injury to the artery wall initiates vascular wound-healing responses that stimulate atherosclerotic plaque growth. The plasminogen activators have cellular chemotactic, adhesion, and proteolytic activity. Serp-1 is a secreted myxoma virus glycoprotein serpin that binds and inhibits plasminogen activators. We have examined the effects of Serp-1 on plaque growth and inflammatory cell invasion in animal models after balloon injury and after aortic allograft transplant. We used histologic analysis to assess 4 animal models of angioplasty-mediated injury and 2 models of aortic allograft transplant for intimal hyperplasia and cellular invasion. We assessed plasminogen activator (uPA and tPA) and inhibitor (PAI-1) expression in rat iliofemoral arteries after balloon injury using Western blot, enzyme activity, and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Plaque growth after balloon injury decreased after Serp-1 treatment in all balloon-injury models tested. Transplant vasculopathy also significantly decreased in 2 rat models of aortic allograft transplant. Infusion of a Serp-1 active site mutant, that lacked plasminogen activator inhibiting activity, did not inhibit plaque growth. Quantitative RT-PCR detected increased transcription of PAI-1 mRNA. Increased PAI-1 protein and enzyme-inhibitory activity was also detected in Serp-1-treated arteries by activity assay and Western blot.

However, it remains controversial as to whether vascular lesions seen in this model are equivalent to those that develop in solid-organ transplants. The aim of this study was to develop a model of combined cardiac and aortic transplantation to allow more precise quantification of transplant arteriosclerosis and to establish a correlation between the lesions that develop in the 2 types of graft. CBA (H2(k)) recipients received a C57BL/10 (H2(b)) cervical cardiac allograft on Day 0 and a C57BL/10 (H2(b)) abdominal aortic allograft on Day 1. Recipients were treated with anti-CD154 mAb (MR1) on Days 0, 2, and 4. We performed histology and morphometric measurements for both grafts 30 days after transplantation. We observed significant intimal proliferation in both the cervical cardiac and abdominal aortic allografts from recipients treated with anti-CD154 mAb (heart, 64% +/- 9%; aorta, 67% +/- 8%; n = 5). Abdominal aortic grafts transplanted alone into anti-CD154-treated recipients developed a degree of transplant arteriosclerosis equivalent to that seen in the aortic grafts of the combined group (aorta alone, 68% +/- 9%, vs aorta + heart, 67% +/- 8%; n = 5).

Angiotensin II is one of the most potent mitogens of smooth muscle cell proliferation and plays a central role in the development of accelerated coronary artery disease (ACAD), which remains a serious consequence after heart transplantation and limits long-term survival. We investigated the effect of an angiotensin-II blocker, Losartan (angiotensin II Type 1 [AT(1)]-blocker), and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, Enalapril, on experimental ACAD in a rat cardiac transplant model (Fisher to Lewis). After grafting, recipients were treated with 10 mg/kg/day per os Losartan or 40 mg/kg/day per os Enalapril. Two groups of animals received additional pre-treatment with Losartan or Enalapril 7 days before transplantation. All study groups, including the control group, received immunosuppression with cyclosporine (3 mg/kg/day sub-cutaneously). We assessed the extent of ACAD of large and small arteries 80 days after grafting using digitizing morphometry. We observed significant reduction of neointimal proliferation in small arteries in Losartan pre- and post-treated and in Enalapril pre-treated recipients compared with the cyclosporine-treated group (p < 0.05). In epicardial arteries, Enalapril pre- and post-treatment as well as Losartan post-treatment significantly reduced neointimal formation compared with the control group. Reduction of neointima by Enalapril post-treatment in small arteries and Losartan pre-treatment in large arteries trended toward but failed statistical significance. Our results suggest the important role of the renin-angiotensin system in neointimal proliferation, which can be reduced equally with ACE inhibitors or the angiotensin-II blocker. Therefore AT(1) blockade with Losartan is a useful therapeutic strategy for inhibition of ACAD after cardiac transplantation.

The energetic charge (EC = [(0.5 ADP + ATP)/ATP + ADP + AMP]) in Celsior, UW-2, and saline was significantly lower (p < 0.001) than in the other groups. The composition of the preservation solutions had a notable effect on myocardial viability. Our results indicated that LYPS and Celsior solutions had comparable efficacy for left ventricular function. However these solutions may offer better preservation than do UW-1, UW-2, or STH-1 solutions.

Pre-transplant blood transfusion (BT) results in better graft survival in organ transplant recipients, especially when BT donor and allograft recipient share an HLA-DR antigen. Although the immunologic mechanisms involved are still poorly understood, we wanted to know whether down regulation of donor-reactive T cells play a role. In a retrospective study, we analyzed the clinical effects of BT for 45 heart transplant (HTx) patients who had each received 1 BT that shared an HLA-DR-antigen with the recipient, and 55 who had a DR-mismatched BT before heart transplantation. From 30 patients, 15 with DR-shared BT and 15 with DR-mismatched BT, peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were available. From each patient, we analyzed PBL samples taken at the day of transplantation (pre-transplant), and 1 to 2 months, 5 to 7 months, 9 to 14 months, 2 years, and 6 to 7 years after transplantation. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursors (CTLp) and helper T-lymphocyte precursors (HTLp) were measured in a combined limiting dilution assay. Analysis of survival during the first 10 years revealed a significantly (p = 0.016) better survival rate in the group of patients who had received HLA-DR-shared BT compared with the group who had received HLA-DR-mismatched BT. Patients of the DR-shared group experienced significantly (p = 0.042) less acute rejections compared with the patients who received DR-mismatched BT. We found no differences in the development of graft vascular disease. Frequencies of CTLp specific for the organ donor did not change with time after transplantation in the individual patients, nor did we detect any differences between the two BT groups. We found the same for organ donor-specific HTLp frequencies. These data suggest again that transfusion effect depends on HLA-DR compatibility between the heart transplant recipient and the pre-transplant BT donor. The mechanism that caused better survival rate was not down regulation of the donor-reactive T-cell frequency.

Heart transplantation is contraindicated as an effective treatment for end-stage Chagas' heart disease because of post-operative recurrence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection and reactivation of disease after immunosupression. In a follow-up study of a heart transplanted patient with Chagas' disease, we prospectively evaluated the usefulness of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for early diagnosis of reactivation. We monitored post-operative recurrence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection with microscopic observation of the parasite in peripheral blood (Strout's method), endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs), skin lesions, and 2 PCR assays, based on the amplification of specific T cruzi kinetoplastid and nuclear DNA sequences. During follow-up, parasite DNA was amplified in blood samples and EMB sections 41 days before we observed patent parasitemia and cutaneous manifestations of reactivation, proving that PCR is much more sensitive than direct microscopic observation for early diagnosis of disease reactivation in heart-transplanted Chagas' disease patients.

Twenty patients with failed Fontan or Glenn procedures were screened for PAVMs prior to HTx by contrast echocardiography, selective pulmonary angiography, and pulmonary venous desaturation. Age at transplant, diagnosis, previous operations, time from Glenn to transplant, systemic oxygenation, hemoglobin level, and ventricular function were determined. The clinical course after HTx was characterized in three patients with significant PAVMs. Indications for HTx were exercise intolerance and severe cyanosis in one patient, and cyanosis and ventricular dysfunction in two. Pre-HTx, mean systemic saturation was 67%; mean pulmonary venous wedge saturation was 81%. Post-HTx, oxygen saturations were normal (> 96%) at 14, 40, and 180 days.

To study the influence of immune and nonimmune risk factors on the development of allograft vasculopathy after cardiac transplantation. We studied 39 patients with a mean age of 46+/-12 years. The following variables were analyzed: weight (kg), body mass index (kg/m2), donor's age and sex, rejection episodes in the first and second years after transplantation, systolic and diastolic blood pressures (mmHg), total cholesterol and fractions (mg/dL), triglycerides (mg/dL), diabetes, and cytomegalovirus infection. The presence of allograft vasculopathy was established through coronary angiography. Allograft vasculopathy was observed in 15 (38%) patients. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups in regard to hypertension, cytomegalovirus infection, diabetes, donor's sex and age, rejection episodes in the first and second years after transplantation, and cholesterol levels. We observed a tendency toward higher levels of triglycerides in the group with disease. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed statistically significant differences between the two groups when we analyzed the body mass index (24.53+/-4.3 versus 28.11+/-4.6; p=0.019).

Tricuspid regurgitation, a fairly common finding after cardiac transplantation, is generally mild or moderate, and is not clinically significant. The etiology of tricuspid regurgitation is not entirely understood, and experience with valve replacement after cardiac transplantation is limited. We describe a case of progressively severe tricuspid regurgitation ultimately requiring tricuspid valve replacement. At operation, the ruptured chordae of the posterior part of anterior and septal leaflet with resulting partially flail leaflets were found. Examination of the papillary muscle showed origins of several of the ruptured chordae. Damage to the tricuspid subvalvular apparatus at endomyocardial biopsy appeared to be a possible cause. A 31-mm Carpentier-Edwards porcine valve was implanted. This was because replacement with a mechanical prosthesis would prevent future right-side heart catheterization and endomyocardial biopsy and in valve repair, the patient remains exposed to the risk of the recurrence of chordal rupture.

Pig-to-primate vascularized xenografts undergo hyperacute rejection (HAR). This results from pre-formed xenoreactive antibodies directed against galactose-alpha1,3-galactose (alphaGal) in the donor organ and activation of the complement cascade. We describe an in vivo murine model of HAR using a BALB/c mice system devoid of histocompatibility or complement differences between donor and recipient to investigate in isolation, the effects of alphaGal epitope and anti-alphaGal antibody interactions in causing rejection of vascularized heart transplants. Gal KO mice were immunized with rabbit red blood cell membranes to induce high anti-alphaGal antibody titers that were predominantly IgM by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). When alphaGal-expressing mice hearts were transplanted heterotopically into these recipients (n= 12), 67% of grafts rejected within 24 h, the majority within 16 h with histological features of HAR. In contrast, none of the grafts in the non-immunized Gal KO recipient control group (n=11) underwent HAR. Interestingly, approximately 50% of the remaining grafts in both the immunized and non-immunized Gal KO recipient group were rejected between 7 and 27 days by a rejection process characterized by a dense infiltrate of macrophage/monocytes, perivascular cuffing and tissue destruction similar to recent descriptions of delayed xenograft rejection (DXR). In addition, some grafts (21.5%) continued to survive in the immunized Gal KO recipients despite the presence of anti-alphaGal antibody and normal complement activity and these showed well-preserved myocardium when harvested whilst still functioning well at days 30 or 90. No rejection was seen when Gal KO donors were used in this system (n=4), nor when alphaGal-expressing BALB/c hearts were transplanted into alphaGal-expressing BALB/c recipients (n=5). This in vivo small animal model offers the opportunity to test a variety of strategies to overcome HAR prior to more resource intensive pig-to-primate studies, and may provide insights into the processes similar to DXR and accommodation.

The anti-galactose-alpha1,3-galactose (Gal) antibody (Ab) response following pig-to-human transplantation is vigorous and largely resistant to currently available immunosuppression. The recent generation of GT-Ko mice provides a unique opportunity to study the immunological basis of xenograft-elicited anti-Gal Ab response in vivo, and to test the efficacy of various strategies at controlling this Ab response [1]. In this study, we compared the ability of non-depleting anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 to control rejection and antibody production in GT-Ko mice following xenograft and allograft transplantation. Hearts from baby Lewis rat or C3H mice were transplanted heterotopically into GT-Ko. Non-depleting anti-CD4 (YTS177) and anti-CD8 (YTS105) Abs were used at 1 mg/mouse, and given as four doses daily from day -2 to 1 then q.o.d. till day 21. Xenograft rejection occurred at 3 to 5 days post-transplantation in untreated GT-Ko recipients, and was histologically characterized as vascular rejection. Anti-CD4, but not anti-CD8, Ab treatment prolonged xenograft survival to 68 to 74 days and inhibited anti-Gal Ab as well as xeno-Ab production. In four of the five hearts from anti-CD4 mAbs-treated GT-Ko mice, we observed classic signs of chronic rejection, namely, thickened intima in the lumen of vessels, significant IgM deposition, fibrosis and modest mononuclear cell infiltrate of Mac-1+ macrophages and scattered T cells (CD8>CD4). Xenograft rejection in untreated, as well as anti-CD4- and anti-CD8-treated, recipients was associated with increased intragraft IL-6, IFN-gamma and IL-10 mRNA. C3H allografts were rejected in 7 to 9 days by untreated GT-Ko mice and were histologically characterized as cellular rejection. Treatment with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 mAb resulted in graft survivals of >94.8 and 11.8 days, respectively. Anti-CD4 mAb treatment resulted in a transient inhibition of alloreactive and anti-Gal Ab production. The presence of circulating alloreactive and anti-Gal Abs at >50 days post-transplant was associated with significant IgM and IgG deposition in the graft. Yet, in the anti-CD4 mAb-treated group, the allografts showed no signs of rejection at the time of sacrifice (>100 days post-transplantation). All rejected allografts had elevated levels of intragraft IL-6, IFN-gamma and IL-10 mRNA, while the long-surviving anti-CD4-treated allografts had reduced mRNA levels of these cytokines. Collectively, our studies suggest that the elicited xeno-antibody production and anti-Gal Ab production in GT-Ko mice are CD4+ T-cell dependent. The majority of xenografts succumbed to chronic rejection, while allografts survived with minimal histological change, despite elevated levels of circulating alloAbs. Thus, immunosuppression with anti-CD4 mAb therapy induces long-term survival of allografts more effectively than to xenografts.

Long-term left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) have been used both as a bridge to heart transplantation and to recovery of native myocardial function. Despite much evidence for reversal of some of the structural and functional changes present in the failing heart during LVAD support, clinical evidence for sustained myocardial recovery is scant. We describe 2 patients in whom myocardial recovery during LVAD support led to device explanation only to have heart failure recur. This necessitated a second LVAD implantation, a process that we have termed recurrent remodeling. The medical records of 2 patients with cardiomyopathy supported with HeartMate LVADs (Thermo Cardiosystems, Inc, Woburn, MA) were retrospectively reviewed. One patient was supported with an LVAD for 2 months, at which time the LVAD was explanted. Progressive deterioration of cardiac function followed, requiring a second LVAD 19 months after LVAD explanation. After 2 months of further LVAD support, a second episode of apparent myocardial recovery was observed during a period of device malfunction. The other patient was supported with an LVAD for 12 months, at which time the LVAD was explanted. The patient experienced progressive hemodynamic deterioration and required a second LVAD 6 months after LVAD explantation. Heart transplantations of both patients were successful. Our understanding of myocardial recovery in the setting of hemodynamic unloading with LVAD support has not yet progressed to the point where we are able to accurately predict successful long-term LVAD explantation. The evolution of reliable predictors of sustainable myocardial recovery will help to avoid further cases of recurrent remodeling requiring repeat LVAD implantation.

Early implantation of centrifugal devices in patients with postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock may provide a bridge to recovery and allow subsequent long-term survival.

Indications were postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock (PCCS) (n = 60), bridge to cardiac retransplantation (n = 1), and right ventricular failure (n = 1). Patients' ages ranged from 23 to 78 years; 40 were men (65%), and 22 were women (35%).

Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) may be used (1) as a bridging device to cardiac transplantation, (2) for permanent replacement of left ventricular function, and (3) as a bridge to recovery of ventricular function, for example, in recoverable myocardial disease. In this third group of patients, it is important that the LVAD does not produce changes in the heart that will have a deleterious effect on cardiac function once the device is removed. Furthermore, if the LVAD fails, survival depends on optimal function of the diseased heart. All hearts with LVADs encountered as surgical specimens following heart transplantation or at autopsy at the Fairview-University of Minnesota Medical Center during the 5-month period August 1998 to January 1999 were examined for native valvular heart disease. The nature and extent of commissural fusion was noted and measured. Light microscopy was performed on any valve lesions. Four of 6 patients with HeartMate (Thermo Cardiosystems, Inc, Woburn, MA) LVADs showed evidence of commissural fusion (acquired aortic stenosis). In 1 patient, this condition was caused by an organizing thrombus uniting a 14-mm length of the commissural region of the right coronary and noncoronary cusps of the aortic valve. Fibrous commissural fusion due to totally organized thrombus in the other 3 patients affected one aortic commissure (2 patients, 2 mm and 4 mm, respectively) and two commissures (1 patient, 2 mm and 5 mm). Partial cuspal fusion in each case was due to permanent closure of the native aortic valve induced by the LVAD's operating in its automatic setting. Mean length of commissural fusion was 5.4 mm (range, 2 to 14 mm; standard deviation [SDI = +/-5.0 mm). Mean duration of implantation of the six LVADs was 180.3 days (range, 26 to 689 days; SD = +/-253.8 days). The LVADs of the 3 patients with fibrous fusion of the commissures had been implanted for an average of 252.3 days (range, 26 to 689 days; SD = +/-378.2 days). Normal function of the LVAD produces permanent closure of the native aortic valve. Stasis on the ventricular aspect of the aortic valve, combined with a low level of anticoagulation, favors thrombosis at this site. Thrombus organization leads to aortic stenosis of variable severity. This previously unsuspected complication was not detected clinically in any of our patients. Aortic stenosis may hold serious implications for patients in whom the LVAD acts as a bridge to recovery or in those in whom the LVAD fails. Prevention may be achieved by intermittently reducing LVAD pumping action. A built-in venting cycle would be of value in long-term implants. Thrombi on the aortic valve may also predispose patients to infective endocarditis, because bloodstream infection is common in patients with LVADs.

Graft survival after skeletal myoblast transplantation is affected by various pathological processes caused by environmental stress. Heat shock is known to afford protection of several aspects of cell metabolism and function.

L6 rat skeletal myoblasts expressing ss-galactosidase (ss-gal) were subjected to heat shock (42 degrees C, 1 hour). Increased expression of heat shock protein 72 was detected 24 hours later in the heat-shocked cells. After hypoxia-reoxygenation in vitro, lactate dehydrogenase leakage was significantly attenuated in the heat-shocked cells; in addition, the percentage of early apoptosis was lower in this group measured by flow cytometry with annexin V staining. For the in vivo study, 1 x 10(6) heat-shocked (hsCTx) or normal-cultured (CTx) myoblasts were infused into the explanted rat hearts through the coronary artery followed by heterotopic heart transplantation. ss-gal activity was significantly higher in the hsCTx group after cell transplantation, with an estimated 8 x 10(6) surviving cells per heart in the hsCTx group and 5 x 10(6) cells in the CTx group on day 28. Discrete loci of grafted cells were globally observed in the myocardium of the hsCTx and CTx groups, with a higher frequency in the hsCTx group. Surviving myoblasts occasionally differentiated into myotubes and had integrated with the native cardiomyocytes. Heat-shocked skeletal myoblasts demonstrated improved tolerance to hypoxia-reoxygenation insult in vitro and enhanced survival when grafted into the heart. Heat shock treatment could be useful in improving graft cell survival in cell transplantation.

Multivariate analysis (Cox regression) included age at HT, sex, skin type, first-year rejection score, presence of warts and solar keratosis, lifetime sunlight exposure, and first-year cumulative dose of steroids. The incidence of skin tumors of all types increased from 15% after 5 years to 35% after 10 years after HT according to life-table analysis. Age at HT of >50 years (P:=0.03, RR=5.3), skin type II (P:=0.05, RR=2.6), rejection score of 19 (P:=0.003, RR=5.7), solar keratosis (P:=0.001, RR=6.9), and lifetime sunlight exposure of >30 000 hours (P:=0.0003, RR=7.6) were risk factors for SCC. Older age at HT, light skin type, solar keratosis, greater sunlight exposure, and high rejection score in the first year were independently associated with an increased risk of SCC. The progressive increase in cancer frequency during follow-up and the association with high rejection scores suggest that both the length and level of immunosuppression may be relevant. Because cumulative immunosuppressive load is cumbersome to calculate, a high rejection score in the first year may provide a useful predictor for patients at risk.

We have attributed organ engraftment to clonal exhaustion-deletion of host-versus-graft and graft-versus-host reactions that are reciprocally induced and governed by migratory donor and recipient leukocytes. The so-called donor passenger leukocytes that migrate from the allograft into the recipients have been thoroughly studied (chimerism), but not the donor leukocytes that remain in, or return to, the transplanted organ. Therefore, using flow cytometry we determined the percentage and lineages of donor leukocytes in cell suspensions prepared from Lewis (LEW) cardiac allografts to 100 days posttransplantation. The LEW hearts were transplanted to na\u00efve untreated Brown Norway (BN) recipients (group 2), to na\u00efve BN recipients treated with a 28-day or continuous course of tacrolimus (TAC) (groups 3 and 4), and to drug-free BN recipients pretolerized by earlier bone marrow cell (BMC) or orthotopic LEW liver transplantation (groups 5 and 6). The findings in the heart cell suspensions were correlated with the results from parallel histopathologic-immunocytochemical studies and other studies of the grafts and of host tissues. Although the LEW heart allografts were rejected in 9.6 days by the unmodified recipients of group 2, all beat for 100 days in the recipients of groups 3 through 6. Nevertheless, all of the long-surviving cardiac allografts (but not the isografts in group 1) were the targets of an immune reaction at 5 days, reflected by dramatic increases in the ratio of leukocytes to nonleukocyte nucleated cells from normal values of 1:5-1:6 to 1:1-5:1 and by manifold other evidence of a major inflammatory event. The acute changes returned to baseline by 100 days in the chronic rejection (CR) free hearts of groups 4 and 6, but not in the CR-afflicted hearts of short-course TAC group 3 or the less-severely damaged hearts of the BMC-prime group 5. The freedom from CR in groups 4 and 6 was associated with a large donor contribution to the intracardiac leukocyte population at 5 days (28.6% and 22% in the respective groups) and at 100 days (30.5% in group 4 and 8.4% in group 6) compared with 2% and 1.2% at 100 days in the CR-blighted allografts of the partially tolerant animals of groups 3 and 5. Whether large or small, the donor leukocyte fraction always included a subset of class II leukocytes that had histopathologic features of dendritic cells. These class II(+) cells were of mixed myeloid (CD11b/c(+)) and lymphoid lineages; their migration was markedly inhibited by TAC and accelerated by donor-specific priming and TAC discontinuance. Although a large donor leukocyte population and a normal leukocyte/nonleukocyte cell ratio were associated with freedom from CR, these findings and the lineage profile of the intracardiac leukocytes were not associated with tolerance in the animals of groups 3 and 4 under active TAC treatment. The findings in this study, singly and in their entirety, are compatible with our previously proposed leukocyte migration-localization paradigm of organ allograft acceptance and tolerance.

Chemokines provide signals for activation and recruitment of effector cells into sites of inflammation, acting via specific G protein-coupled receptors. However, in vitro data demonstrating the presence of multiple ligands for a given chemokine receptor, and often multiple receptors for a given chemokine, have led to concerns of biologic redundancy. Here we show that acute cardiac allograft rejection is accompanied by progressive intragraft production of the chemokines interferon (IFN)-gamma-inducible protein of 10 kD (IP-10), monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig), and IFN-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC), and by infiltration of activated T cells bearing the corresponding chemokine receptor, CXCR3. We used three in vivo models to demonstrate a role for CXCR3 in the development of transplant rejection. First, CXCR3-deficient (CXCR3(-/)-) mice showed profound resistance to development of acute allograft rejection. Second, CXCR3(-/)- allograft recipients treated with a brief, subtherapeutic course of cyclosporin A maintained their allografts permanently and without evidence of chronic rejection. Third, CXCR(+/+) mice treated with an anti-CXCR3 monoclonal antibody showed prolongation of allograft survival, even if begun after the onset of rejection. Taken in conjunction with our findings of CXCR3 expression in rejecting human cardiac allografts, we conclude that CXCR3 plays a key role in T cell activation, recruitment, and allograft destruction.

Preliminary findings suggest that children and adolescents generally functioned within the normal range on most measures of cognitive functioning post-transplant. However, a complicated transplant course caused by infections or rejections may place these recipients at increased risk for cognitive difficulties post-transplant. Studies also suggested that approximately 20%-24% of pediatric heart transplant recipients experienced significant symptoms of psychological distress (e.g., anxiety, depression, behavior problems) during the first year post-transplant. Research suggests that some recipients are at risk for cognitive and psychological difficulties post-transplant and may require additional academic remediation and/or psychological intervention to address these challenges.

The hallmark of acute allograft rejection is infiltration of the inflamed graft by circulating leukocytes. We studied the role of fractalkine (FKN) and its receptor, CX(3)CR1, in allograft rejection. FKN expression was negligible in nonrejecting cardiac isografts but was significantly enhanced in rejecting allografts. At early time points, FKN expression was particularly prominent on vascular tissues and endothelium. As rejection progressed, FKN expression was further increased, with prominent anti-FKN staining seen around vessels and on cardiac myocytes. To determine the capacity of FKN on endothelial cells to promote leukocyte adhesion, we performed adhesion assays with PBMC and monolayers of TNF-alpha-activated murine endothelial cells under low-shear conditions. Treatment with either anti-FKN or anti-CX(3)CR1-blocking Ab significantly inhibited PBMC binding, indicating that a large proportion of leukocyte binding to murine endothelium occurs via the FKN and CX(3)CR1 adhesion receptors. To determine the functional significance of FKN in rejection, we treated cardiac allograft recipients with daily injections of anti-CX(3)CR1 Ab. Treatment with the anti-CX(3)CR1 Ab significantly prolonged allograft survival from 7 +/- 1 to 49 +/- 30 days (p < 0.0008). These studies identify a critical role for FKN in the pathogenesis of acute rejection and suggest that FKN may be a useful therapeutic target in rejection.

We have developed a model of transforming growth factor (TGF)beta1 gene transfer into mouse vascularized cardiac allografts to study the use of gene transfer as an immunosuppressive therapy in transplantation. Donor hearts were perfused with either DNA-liposome complexes or adenoviral vectors that encode the active form of human TGFbeta1. DNA-liposome mediated transfection prolonged allograft survival in approximately two-thirds of transplant recipients, while adenoviral delivery of TGFbeta1 was not protective. Protective TGFbeta1 gene transfer was associated with reduced Th1 responses and an inhibition of the alloantibody isotype switch. The protective effects of TGFbeta1 gene transfer were overridden by exogenous interleukin-12 administration. Interestingly, alloreactive CD4+ and CD8+ cells exhibited distinct sensitivities to TGFbeta1 gene transfer: CD4+ Th1 function was abrogated by this modality, although CD8+ Th1 function was not. Transient depletion of recipient CD8+ cells markedly prolonged the survival of grafts transfected with either DNA-liposome complexes or adenoviral vectors. Transgene expression persisted for at least 60 days, and Th1 responses were not detectable until CD8+ T cells repopulated the periphery. However, long-term transfected allografts appeared to exhibit exacerbated fibrosis and neointimal development. These manifestations of chronic rejection were absent in long-term transfected isografts, suggesting that long-term expression of active TGFbeta1 alone is not sufficient to induce fibrosis of the grafts. Collectively, these data illustrate the utility of immunosuppressive gene therapy as a treatment for transplantation when combined with additional conditioning regimens. Further, they illustrate that alloreactive CD4+ and CD8+ cells may be differentially influenced by cytokine manipulation strategies.

Cardiac allograft arteriopathy, which limits the long-term survival of recipients, is characterized by diffuse intimal thickening composed of proliferative smooth muscle cells. The transcription factor E2F plays a pivotal role in the coordinated transcription of cell-cycle regulatory genes. To test the hypothesis that double-stranded DNA with specific affinity for E2F (E2F decoy) is effective in preventing intimal hyperplasia, we performed ex vivo single intraluminal delivery of E2F decoy into cardiac allografts of mice and Japanese monkeys using the hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ) artificial viral envelope-liposome method. In murine models, antisense cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) kinase oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) and no transfers were performed to compare the effects. Severe intimal thickening was observed, and multiple cell-cycle regulatory genes were enhanced in untreated allografts. E2F decoy prevented neointimal formation and suppressed these genes for up to 8 weeks, whereas antisense cdk2 kinase ODN had limited effects. In primate models, E2F decoy dramatically prevented neointimal thickening and suppressed multiple cell-cycle regulatory genes, whereas intimal thickening developed in the nontransfected or mismatch decoy-transfected allografts. Gel mobility shift assay proved the specific effects of E2F decoy, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction documented that neither complication nor dissemination of HVJ into other organs was observed. We demonstrate that ex vivo gene delivery to allografts is a potent strategy to modify allograft gene expression, resulting in prevention of graft arteriopathy without systemic adverse effects.

Five patients were treated with percutaneous IABP for early postoperative low cardiac output syndrome characterized by predominantly right ventricular failure.

The role of cardiac sympathetic nerves in the regulation of myocardial metabolism is not well defined. Owing to the presence of incomplete reinnervation, heart transplant recipients provide a unique model to study the effects of efferent sympathetic innervation. Using this model, we sought to determine the influence of cardiac sympathetic signals on substrate utilisation and overall oxidative metabolism. In 21 transplant recipients, positron emission tomography was applied to determine sympathetic innervation with the noradrenaline analogue carbon11 hydroxyephedrine, oxidative metabolism with carbon11 acetate (n=14), and glucose utilisation with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (n=7). The reinnervated area comprised 22% +/- 20% of the left ventricle. Oxidative metabolism was similar in denervated and reinnervated myocardium [0.06 +/- 0.01 vs 0.06 +/- 0.01/min for k(mono)], while glucose uptake was significantly higher in denervated myocardium (6.9 +/- 6.6 vs 6.0 +/- 6.2 micromol/min/100 g; P=0.03). Reinnervation mainly occurred in the territory of the left anterior descending artery, where retention of 11C-hydroxyephedrine (6.8 +/- 2.7%/min) was higher compared with territories of the left circumflex (4.1 +/- 1.7%/min; P<0.01) and right coronary (3.8 +/- 1.1%/min; P<0.01) arteries.

Similar degrees of regional heterogeneity were not observed in normals.

The authors herein report the outcome of those patients in their institution who had undergone percutaneous coronary artery angioplasty and stenting at a late stage of their transplantation. Within a 12-year period, 106 adult patients underwent orthotopic heart transplantation at their institution. Eight of these patients with 17 lesions underwent deployment of nine stents and eight angioplasties 8.1 +/- 3.2 years posttransplantation. There were 15 denovo and two restenotic lesions. The indications for intervention were presence of symptoms in five patients and severity of lesions in three asymptomatic patients detected on their follow-up angiogram. All patients had angiographic worsening of lesions at their follow-up angiogram. The initial procedural success for both stented and angioplastied lesions was 100%.

Acute rejection, graft atherosclerosis and infections are the major causes of morbility and mortality after heart transplantation. Therefore clinical follow-up after heart transplantation is usually focused on the early diagnosis and treatment of these complications. The early recognition of acute rejection episodes in cardiac allograft recipients remains a major challenge during follow-up after heart transplantation. The standard method used to identify rejection is endomyocardial biopsy, but this technique shows some important inherent limitations. Even if noninvasive methods are generally considered inaccurate in the early diagnosis of acute rejection, echocardiography is routinely used in the surveillance of heart transplant recipients to monitor allograft function. Furthermore it may be used to screen significant acute rejection episodes, because it can identify several morphologic and functional changes that are related to acute rejection: increase in left ventricular myocardial thickness, changes in ultrasonic texture, pericardial effusion, systolic and diastolic dysfunction. In this setting it is very useful to perform serial echocardiographic examinations, because the changes of echocardiographic and Doppler parameters in comparison with previous examination in each individual patient can be accurate in detecting acute rejection and evaluating the response after immunosuppressive treatment. The development of coronary artery disease (CAD) is the major factor limiting long-term survival. Serial coronary artery angiography remains the only effective diagnostic tool for detecting CAD, while noninvasive tests commonly used in atherosclerotic heart disease are considered inaccurate, due to their low sensitivity. However several studies reported a high accuracy of dobutamine stress echocardiography in the diagnostic and prognostic assessment of CAD. Furthermore, rest wall motion abnormalities and left ventricular systolic dysfunction can identify patients with significant CAD and worse prognosis.

Although structure measurements were significantly different between patients with and those without fractures (P <.05), BMDs were not. Correlations between time after transplantation and some structure measurements were moderately significant (P <. 05), but such correlations with BMD measurements were not. MR imaging-derived structure measurements in the calcaneus are useful for monitoring bone changes after heart transplantation and assessing vertebral fracture status.

Liver grafts are spontaneously accepted in several animal combinations and are able to induce acceptance of another organ originating from the same donor, which would be rejected when transplanted alone. However, the exact mechanism of this unique tolerance induction capability remains unclear. The aim of our study was to investigate the ability of nonparenchymal liver cells to induce tolerance when they were separated from their parenchymal environment. In the murine combination we used (BN --> LEW), heart transplants were constantly tolerated after combined liver plus heart grafting, but rejected when transplanted alone. Nonparenchymal liver cells were isolated from BN rat livers by enzymatic digestion and injected, at different times, to LEW rats, which were recipients of BN heart transplants. The average number of mononuclear cells obtained after isolation was 20 x 10(6)/5 g of rat liver. Immediate trypan-blue exclusion test showed more than 95% of viable cells. Phenotypic studies showed a predominant (47%) lymphocyte population, 7% were monocytes and 46% were cellular debris. Among the lymphocyte population, the majority of cells were bearing the NKR-P1 receptor and about 30% CD3 receptors. Inoculation of nonparenchymal liver cells 7 and 30 days prior to heart transplantation significantly prolonged graft survival compared to controls (14.6 and 12.7 vs. 8.1 days; p = 0.0008 and 0.0059, respectively), whereas simultaneous injection (day 0) had no effect. Injection of donor splenocytes or nonparenchymal liver cells from a third party, at any time, had no effect on rejection. These results provide some more evidence about the specific role of liver lymphocytes in allogenic unresponsiveness. They also suggest that the hepatic parenchymal environment is necessary for the optimal development of this phenomenon.

Optimal preservation of the myocardium remains a major concern in clinical and experimental heart transplantation. The present study compared the efficacy of University of Wisconsin (UW) and Celsior preservation solution with respect to myocardial performance, epicardial and microvascular endothelial vasomotor function and myocardial expression of endothelin and nitric oxide synthases in humans. Forty-one cardiac transplant recipients received either UW (n = 20) or Celsior (n = 21) preserved hearts. Catecholamine and vasodilator requirements were assessed within the first 5 postoperative days. Left ventricular performance and endothelial function was assessed 1 month after transplantation. Endothelin and nitric oxide synthase gene expression were detected in myocardial biopsy samples. Celsior preserved hearts required significantly more catecholamines and vasodilators within the first 5 postoperative days. Myocardial performance and endothelial function were comparable 1 month after transplantation. Total ischemic time correlated with impaired endothelial function in the Celsior but not in the UW group. Endothelin and inducible nitric oxide synthase gene expression were significantly higher in the Celsior group. The results of the study show that both solutions provide myocardial protection with regard to left ventricular performance and endothelial function 1 month after cardiac transplantation. The necessity for higher vasodilator and catecholamine therapy in Celsior preserved hearts suggests post-ischemic myocardial stunning within the first 5 postoperative days. The positive correlation between impaired endothelial function and total ischemic time in the Celsior group requires longitudinal investigation in particular with regard to the development of allograft vasculopathy.

After heart transplantation a high incidence of infections and malignancies is found. Not only immunosuppression, but also intrinsic cytokine systems with some unbalance, e. g. TNF-alpha and IL-2, can result in impaired immune competence and may have a role in these complications. The aim of this study was to assess the activity of the TNF-alpha and IL-2 systems after heart transplantation. In peripheral blood we measured expression of activation markers of TNF-alpha (TNF-R2) and IL-2 (IL-2R alpha, IL-2R beta-chain) on monocytes and lymphocytes using quantitative flow-cytometric analysis. TNF-R2 expression was significantly enhanced on monocytes and lymphocytes in patients after heart transplantation, while the expression of IL-2R alpha and IL-2R beta was not elevated. Increased TNF-R2 expression in peripheral blood after heart transplantation reflects an activated TNF-alpha system, leading to high levels of active sTNF-R, which impairs TNF-alpha bioavailibility and consequently leads to immune incompetence.

The reduction in the frequency of rejection episodes several months after heart transplantation (HTX) correlates with the development of donor-specific nonresponsiveness. This is reflected in a reduced frequency of donor-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) in the peripheral blood. We investigated whether the reduced CTL frequency and the incidence of rejection episodes coincided with a change in the frequency of either IL-2- or IL-4-producing helper T lymphocytes (HTL). We measured the frequency of HTL before and at several time points after HTX in the blood of ten recipients, using limiting dilution analysis for IL-2 and IL-4. In most patients, HTL frequencies dropped immediately after transplantation, but returned to pre-HTX values later after transplantation. No consistent decrease or increase in frequencies was observed long after HTX. In contrast to IL-2, the HTL frequencies for IL-4 before transplantation were significantly higher in patients without post-HTX rejection episodes requiring treatment than in patients with such episodes. This phenomenon was observed for the in vitro responses towards both donor and third-party cells. In conclusion, relatively high frequencies of IL-4-producing T cells may have a beneficial effect on the outcome of human heart transplantation, because they are associated with a reduced incidence of rejection episodes after transplantation.

On biopsy days and during each follow-up, intramyocardial electrogram sequences were obtained. The maximum T-slew rate from the ventricular evoked response (VER) was automatically calculated and compared to the biopsy results (n = 331, ISHLT grading). The VER T-slew rate was significantly lower during rejection grade 2 or higher. The negative predictive value to exclude rejection was 98%.

Endothelial dysfunction anticipates the development of transplant coronary artery disease (TxCAD) observed more than 1 year after transplantation (HTx). We investigated whether in patients early after HTx myocardial inducible and constitutive nitric oxide synthases (iNOS; cNOS) are expressed and cardiac nitric oxide production occurs. Moreover, a possible relationship to alterations in endothelium dependent and independent vasomotor function was assessed. Forty-two transplant recipients were studied 37 +/- 5 days after HTx. Microvascular coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) was tested endothelium dependent (acetylcholine; 30 microg/min x 5 min/i.c.) and independent (adenosine; 160 microg/min x 5 min/i.c.) by Doppler flow wire. Flow velocity increase by a factor greater than 2 was considered normal. Quantitative coronary angiography was used to assess epicardial vasomotor function in response to the same stimuli. Myocardial iNOS and cNOS gene expression were detected by semiquantitative reversed transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Plasma nitrite levels (microM) were measured by spectrophotometry. Cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6; pg/ml) were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. In 26.1% of patients (n = 11; group A) an impaired endothelium dependent CFVR (1.65 +/- 0.23 increase) was observed; in 73.9% (n = 31, group B) a normal endothelium dependent CFVR (3.0 +/- 0.7 increase; P = 0.003) was observed. Myocardial iNOS and cNOS gene expression did not differ between the two groups. Transcardiac cytokine production was noted in 58.8% of patients for IL-6 and in 53.3% for TNF-alpha. Coronary sinus (CS) levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and nitrite were higher in group A. A significant increase in nitrite production was found only in patients with impaired endothelium dependent CFVR (aorta: 43.9 +/- 3.7 vs CS: 52.8 +/- 5.6, P = 0.05), suggesting transcardiac nitric oxide production. In addition, CS nitrite levels correlated with CS TNF-alpha levels in patients with impaired CFVR (r = 0.44, P = 0.003).

A significant linear correlation was found between donor heart ischemic time and peaks and the area under the curve of cTn-I and CK-MB release. In patients with an ischemic time longer than 90 min, cTn-I release was significantly lower in those receiving continuous retrograde warm cardioplegia than in controls.

The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer with CTLA4Ig gene on the transgene expression and suppression of alloimmune response in allogeneic cardiac transplantation of rats. Adenoviral vectors with beta galactosidase or human CTLA4Ig cDNA (Adex/LacZ, Adex/hCTLA4Ig) were constructed. These vectors were transduced to the liver of Lewis (LEW) rats by intravenous injection. Then LEW rats received heterotopic cardiac transplantation from Dark Agouti rats. Experiments were performed using both CTLA4Ig gene transduction and/or immunosuppressant FK506. The transgene expression after adenovirus-mediated transfer with CTLA4Ig cDNA lasted for several months, compared with several weeks after that in controls, which was proportional to the blood concentration of CTLA4Ig protein. By the administration of 1 x 10(9) PFU of Adex/hCTLA4Ig, the survival of cardiac grafts was significantly prolonged, compared with controls or the use of 1 x 10(8) PFU of Adex/hCTLA4Ig. In the rats with beating grafts over 100 days, the blood concentrations of CTLA4Ig were undetectable. The combination therapy using a low titer Adex/hCTLA4Ig and low-dose of FK506 was synergistically effective on this cardiac transplantation model.

These tests were then repeated 1 week later and then again 1 week after that, making nine tests in all. The within-subject S.D. was 0.49 log units in normal subjects and 0.79 log units in transplant recipients. In both cases, this is about 15% of the population range. There was significant variation in heart rate variability between different times of day in both groups, and from day to day in transplant recipients. It was concluded that the reproducibility of measurements of heart rate variability is low, and that differences between measurements performed at different times of day should be interpreted with caution.

Although impairment of the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) in heart transplant recipients is well-documented, there are limited data on its impact on exercise capacity in these patients. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of DLCO reduction on exercise capacity in heart transplant recipients. Descriptive cohort study. A regional cardiopulmonary transplant center. Twenty-six heart transplant recipients who were studied before and after transplantation compared with 26 healthy volunteers. Spirometry and static lung volumes were measured using body plethysmography, DLCO was measured using the single-breath technique, and progressive cardiopulmonary exercise was performed using a bicycle ergometer, continuous transcutaneous blood gas monitoring, and on-line analysis of minute ventilation, oxygen uptake (VO(2)), and carbon dioxide production. Before transplantation, the mean percent predicted for hemoglobin-corrected DLCO was reduced in patients (73.2%) compared to healthy control subjects (98.8%; p < 0.001) and declined significantly after transplantation (60.1%; p < 0.05). Although the mean maximal symptom-limited VO(2) (VO(2)max) increased after transplantation (increase, 41.3 to 48.6% of predicted; p < 0.05), it remained substantially lower than normal (92.9%; p < 0.001). There was a significant correlation between DLCO and VO(2)max after transplantation (r = 0.61; p = 0.001), but not before transplantation (r = 0.09; p = 0.66). DLCO was also inversely correlated with other respiratory responses to exercise, including the following: the ventilatory response to exercise (r = -0.44; p < 0.05); dead space to tidal volume ratio (r = -43; p < 0.05); and the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (r = -0. 45; p < 0.05), but there was no correlation between any of these variables and DLCO before transplantation. DLCO reduction after heart transplantation appears to represent persistent gas exchange impairment and contributes to exercise limitation in heart transplant recipients.

The purpose of this article is to review for the nontransplant physician the concept of CAV as a disease entity after heart transplantation. A MEDLINE search from 1985 to 1999 was performed. Data on cardiac transplant vasculopathy were divided into pathology, pathophysiology, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment. CAV manifests as a unique and unusually aggressive form of coronary artery disease that differs from traditional atherosclerosis. It is believed to be caused by immunologic mechanisms that combine with nonimmunologic factors to cause endothelial injury, resulting in smooth muscle proliferation and intimal thickening. This intimal hyperplasia leads to coronary obstruction, which ultimately results in allograft failure. Diagnosis of CAV can be difficult because transplant recipients have denervated hearts and rarely present with chest pain. Various noninvasive screening methods have not proved reliable. Therefore, most transplant centers perform periodic coronary angiography for routine CAV surveillance. Treatment of CAV involves modification of risk factors and the use of pharmacologic agents that alter vascular physiology. Revascularization procedures continue to play a role as palliative therapy, but are limited in their effectiveness by the diffuse nature of this disease. Cardiac transplant vasculopathy continues to play a major dilemma regarding posttransplant care. Further research is needed to develop successful preventive and therapeutic strategies that may alter the course of this disease.

Immunosuppression may have an important impact on early graft coronary endothelial injury. We investigated functional and morphologic coronary alterations, myocardial expression, and cardiac release of possible mediators of allograft vasculopathy within 6 months after cardiac transplantation with respect to different immunosuppressive regimens. Epicardial and microvascular endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasomotor function and epicardial intimal thickening were measured in 8 transplant recipients treated with cyclosporin A (CyA), azathioprine, and prednisone (group 1), 9 transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus (TKL), azathioprine, and prednisone (group 2), and 14 patients treated with TKL, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and prednisone (group 3). The gene expressions of inducible and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (iNOS and eNOS), endothelin-1, prostacyclinsynthase, and thromboxansynthase were analyzed in endomyocardial biopsy specimens using semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Transcardiac cytokine release, endothelin-1, and nitrate-release were determined from plasma samples. Epicardial endothelial dysfunction (vasoconstriction to acetylcholine > 10%) and microvascular smooth muscle cell dysfunction (flow velocity increase to adenosine and nifedipine < 2.0) were enhanced in heart transplant recipients immunosuppressed with TKL, azathioprine, and prednisone. The prevalence of epicardial dysfunction was 78% in group 2 versus 44% and 46% in group 1 and 3 (p < 0.05), respectively. The prevalence of microvascular dysfunction was 56% in group 2 versus 13% and 7% in group 1 and 3 (p < 0.02), respectively. Coronary vasomotor dysfunction was associated with increased myocardial iNOS expression (p < 0.05), decreased eNOS expression (p < 0.05), and enhanced cardiac immunoreactive interleukin-6 (p < 0.01). Coronary intimal thickening was not different between the groups. The combination of TKL and MMF appears to be superior to TKL and azathioprine (and comparable to CyA and azathioprine) concerning preservation of early coronary vasomotor function, eNOS expression, iNOS suppression as well as cardiac interleukin-6 release.

A registry-based study. Organ transplant recipients are at an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer. Few data concern heart transplantation and populations from southern Europe. A total of 1,329 patients who received their first kidney (1,062 subjects) or heart allograft (267 subjects) were included in a partly retrospective cohort study to evaluate the risk of skin cancer. The incidence rate per 1,000 person-years and the cumulative incidence were computed. Standardized morbidity ratio was estimated by comparison with Italian cancer registry data. To analyze the role of potential prognostic factors, Cox's regression method was used. The overall incidence rate of nonmelanoma skin cancer was 10.0 cases per 1,000 posttransplant person-years (95% confidence interval 8.2-11.7). This estimate was far higher than expected in the general population. The overall risk of developing skin cancer increased from a cumulative incidence of 5.8% after 5 posttransplant years to an incidence of 10.8% after 10 years of graft survival. In a Cox proportional hazard risk model, the most important factors that appeared to favor the development of skin cancer were age at transplantation and sex. After adjustment for age at transplantation and sex, no definite increased risk was documented among heart as compared with kindney transplant recipients.

Apoptosis is tightly regulated by enzymes termed the caspases. We have investigated the caspases involved in the terminal part of the apoptotic pathway in dysfunctional (nontransplanted) donor hearts and their relation to inflammatory markers and compared them to hearts with good ventricular function (transplanted donors). Thirty-one donor hearts assessed for transplantation were examined. Western blotting was used to measure pro-caspase-9, caspase-3, DFF45, the activated nuclease CPAN and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, a DNA repair enzyme inactivated by caspase-3. Caspase-3 activity was also measured. Histologic and immunocytochemical analysis for HLA Class II and Real Time polymerase chain reaction for tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin 6 were performed to detect inflammatory activation. Cleaved caspase-9 was higher (5.53+/-0.6 vs. 3.64+/-0.4 O.D. units, P<0.01) in nontransplanted compared with transplanted donors and there was a trend for higher pro-caspase-9 (5.20+/-1.0 vs. 4.22+/-0.4 O.D. units, P=NS). Levels of pro-caspase-3 were higher in nontransplanted (9.66+/-0.5 vs. 5.15+/-0.5 O.D. units, P<0.00001) donors and cleavage products of caspase-3 were elevated in 14 of 14 nontransplanted and 2 of 17 transplanted donors.

One of the complexities of solid organ allograft rejection is the inherent diversity of the specific T cell antigenic epitopes that participate in this response, including the role of direct alloantigen recognition and indirect recognition of donor-derived peptides in recipient antigen-presenting cells. To probe the role of distinct T cell receptor (TCR) avidity differences and the role of cytokine expression patterns of different effector T cells that may participate in allograft rejections, we have identified a dominant allopeptide derived from the H-2Kd molecule, recognized by H-2b CD4 T cells in the context of syngeneic I-Ab. To identify a stimulatory peptide derived from the H-2Kd molecule, a panel of synthetic overlapping peptides was screened for immunogenicity and a panel of T cell clones established. These clones were characterized for TCR Vbeta usage by mAb staining and/or reverse transcribed-polymerase chain reaction analysis, peptide dose sensitivity as a marker of TCR avidity, cytokine expression phenotype in vitro, and their ability to mediate rejection of a vascularized cardiac allograft after adoptive transfer to immunodeficient mice. The H-2Kd54-68 peptide was identified as a dominant stimulatory peptide by the ability of T cells from C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice primed by a combination of allogeneic spleen cell injection and mixed peptide immunization to mount an in vitro proliferative response and interferon-gamma production by peptide stimulation. Furthermore, direct immunization with synthetic H-2Kd54-68 peptide of normal C57BL/6 mice resulted in accelerated rejection of both skin and cardiac allografts from B10.D2 (H-2d) mice, but not 3rd party B10.BR (H-2k) grafts. A panel of 15 distinct CD4+ clones specific for H-2Kd54-68 peptide were established and shown to utilize a variety of TCR Vbeta and different apparent TCR avidities to H-2Kd54-68 peptide when stimulated in vitro. To characterize these clones further, two clones were chosen based on the difference of avidity to H-2Kd54-68 peptide. The cytokine expression pattern was determined and indirect alloantigen specificity confirmed by analysis of responses to purified peptide and B10.D2 spleen cells using normal H.2b and I-Abeta chain knockout mice as APC donors. Both of these T cell clones were able to mediate rejection of B10.D2, but not B10.BR hearts, in immunodeficient mice, but the morphological pattern of T cell infiltration was distinct. These results demonstrate the potential importance of fine dissection of the alloantigeneic response to solid organ transplants and provide unique insights into the role of TCR avidity and cytokine expression patterns in different morphological patterns of transplant rejection.

Modest prolongation of CBK cardiac grafts was induced in CBA mice fed with multiple doses of CBK splenocytes (MST 42 days compared with controls fed with syngeneic CBA splenocytes, 12 days). When the CD4 monoclonal antibody, YTS177, was administered for 2 days before the first oral delivery of CBK splenocytes, all mice accepted their grafts indefinitely (MST > 100 days versus mice treated with anti-CD4 alone, 11.5 days). To determine if feeding multiple doses of alloantigen was essential, CBA mice were given CBK splenocytes orally on a single occasion in combination with the anti-CD4. The majority of the grafts survived indefinitely (MST >100 days). This oral treatment regimen also induced indefinite prolongation of (C57BL/10xCBA)F1 cardiac grafts. The induction of unresponsiveness by oral administration of alloantigen can be augmented by a nondepleting anti-CD4, YTS177, when given before the first oral delivery of allogeneic cells.

Chronic rejection remains the major obstacle to long term survival in heart transplant recipients. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie chronic rejection are not known, and their discovery can form the basis of clinical intervention. Several investigators have suggested that the development of chronic rejection in solid organ transplants is dependent on help mediated by CD4(+) lymphocytes. Importantly, the mechanism through which help is provided has not been fully delineated in transplant rejection. Using a murine heterotopic heart transplant model without immunosuppression, this study defines the functional role of CD4(+) lymphocytes in chronic rejection. In an MHC class II-mismatched model, we demonstrate that chronic rejection was absolutely contingent on the presence of CD4(+) lymphocytes. Importantly, here we report that signaling through CD40 can replace the requirement of CD4(+) lymphocytes, demonstrated by the development of chronic rejection in CD4 knockout recipients treated with a CD40-activating mAb (FGK45). The return of rejection appears to be a CD8(+) lymphocyte-dependent process, noted by the absence of rejection in FGK45-treated recombinase-activated gene knockout (CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocyte-deficient) recipients. The CD40 signaling pathway works independently of B7-CD28 costimulation, as indicated by the development of severe chronic rejection in CD28 knockout recipients. Importantly, this study provides evidence that CD40 ligand-targeted therapies may prevent chronic rejection only in strain combinations where CD4(+) lymphocyte help is absolutely required.

Great insight has emerged from experimental models and intravascular ultrasound study of patients, but treatments are still crude and produce less than optimal results. Nonetheless, it has been demonstrated that diltiazem, pravastatin, ganciclovir, newer immunosuppressive agents, and photophoresis may be helpful.

Standard immunosuppressive drugs used for allogeneic organ transplantation do not specifically target alloreactive T cells and must be given for the lifetime of the patient, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. We aimed to induce experimental immune tolerance to vascularized heart allograft using a suicide gene allowing selective elimination of dividing T cells expressing Herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase upon ganciclovir administration. We show that without ganciclovir, transgenic mice selectively expressing thymidine kinase in T cells rejected a vascularized cardiac allograft in 7 days. In contrast, allograft was definitively accepted after a 7-day course of ganciclovir initiated at the time of allotransplantation. Interestingly, T cells from both rejecting and tolerant mice proliferated in response to donor or third-party allogeneic stimulation. This state of tolerance was challenged through a second vascularized cardiac allotransplantation. Third-party allografts were rejected while those syngeneic to the first allograft were accepted without any additional treatment. These results show that short-term pharmacogenetic immunosuppression can induce long-lasting, robust, and specific tolerance to solid vascularized allograft without generalized continuous immunosuppression.

In this study, the fifth generation of ethylenediamine core dendrimer was investigated for its ability to enhance gene transfer and expression in a clinically relevant murine vascularized heart transplantation model. The plasmid pMP6A-beta-gal, encoding beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal), was incubated with dendrimers to form complexes. The complexes were perfused via the coronary arteries during donor graft harvesting, and reporter gene expression was determined by quantitative evaluation of X-Gal staining. The grafts infused with pMP6A-beta-gal/dendrimer complexes showed beta-Gal expression in myocytes from 7 to 14 days. A number of variables for transfer of the DNA/dendrimer complexes were tested, including DNA:dendrimer charge ratios, concentrations of DNA and dendrimer, preservation solutions, ischemic time, and enhancement of vascular permeability by serotonin, papaverine, and VEGF administration. The results showed that DNA/dendrimer complexes containing 20 microg of DNA and 260 microg of dendrimer (1:20 charge ratio) in a total volume of 200 microl resulted in highest gene expression in the grafts.

Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressant drug with a narrow therapeutic window and thus requires therapeutic drug monitoring. This study evaluates the suitability of the second-generation microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA II) against a specific method, high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), for the measurement of tacrolimus in both heart- and lung-transplant groups. A secondary objective was to investigate the effect of tacrolimus concentration on MEIA II measurement. The HPLC-MS assay was conducted as per our reported method and MEIA II performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Quality-control samples at 5, 11, and 22 microg/L were run in each batch to ensure assay integrity in both methods. Multiple trough samples from 18 heart patients (n = 126) and 17 lung patients (n = 203) were analyzed. The inter-batch imprecision and analytical recovery over the quality-control range by HPLC-MS (n = 12) was <6% and 98.2% to 104%, respectively, and by MEIA II (n = 16) <15% and 92.0% to 99.1%, respectively. The mean overestimation by MEIA II between the two methods for heart- and lung-transplant patient samples was found to be 9.9% (range: -37.4-45.4%) and 13.2% (range: -29.2-64.3%), respectively. Stratification of these data based on the tacrolimus concentration determined by MEIA II, yielded no statistically significant differences in bias between concentration subgroups within the clinically relevant range (p > 0.4). However, a statistically significant difference was detected between the highest concentration subgroup (>20.0 microg/L) and lower concentration subgroups in both transplant populations (p < 0.05). This study suggests that where HPLC-MS is not available, MEIA II may be suitable for the therapeutic drug monitoring of tacrolimus in heart- and lung-transplant recipients.

An urgent and steadily increasing need exists world-wide for a greater supply of donor thoracic organs. Xenotransplantation offers the possibility of an unlimited supply of hearts and lungs that could be available electively when required. However, anti-body- mediated mechanisms cause the rejection of pig organs transplanted into non-human primates, and these mechanisms provide major immunologic barriers that have not yet been overcome. Having reviewed the literature on xenotransplantation, we present a number of conclusions on its present status with regard to thoracic organs, and we make a number of recommendations relating to eventual clinical trials. Although pig hearts have functioned in heterotopic sites in non-human primates for periods of several weeks, median survival of orthotopically transplanted hearts is currently ,1 month. No transplanted pig lung has functioned for even 24 hours. Current experimental results indicate that a clinical trial would be premature. A potential risk exists, hitherto undetermined, of transferring infectious organisms along with the donor pig organ to the recipient, and possibly to other members of the community. A clinical trial of xeno-transplantation should not be undertaken until experts in microbiology and the relevant regulatory authorities consider this risk to be minimal. A clinical trial should be considered when approximately 60% survival of life-supporting pig organs in non-human primates has been achieved for a minimum of 3 months, with at least 10 animals surviving for this minimum period. Furthermore, evidence should suggest that longer survival (.6 months) can be achieved. These results should be achieved in the absence of life-threatening complications caused by the immunosuppressive regimen used. The relationship between the presence of anti-HLA antibody and anti-pig antibody and their cross-reactivity, and the outcome of pig-organ xenotransplantation in recipients previously sensitized to HLA antigens require further investigation. We recommend that the patients who initially enter into a clinical trial of cardiac xenotransplantation be unacceptable for allotransplantation, or acceptable for allotransplantation but unlikely to survive until a human cadaveric organ becomes available, and in whom mechanical assist-device bridging is not possible. National bodies that have wide-reaching government-backed control over all aspects of the trials should regulate the initial clinical trial and all subsequent clinical xenotransplantation procedures for the foreseeable future. We recommend coordination and monitoring of these trials through an international body, such as the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, and setting up a registry to record and widely disperse the results of these trials. Xenotransplantation has the potential to solve the problem of donor-organ supply, and therefore research in this field should be actively encouraged and supported.

The unique demands of cardiac transplantation in infancy have led to non-invasive rejection-surveillance strategies.

A cumulative ECHO-A score > or =4 is highly predictive of endomyocardial biopsy Grade > or =3 and of cellular rejection. This study determined whether modifying ECHO-A to score for deviations of recipient parameters from the recipient's baseline would improve the predictive power of ECHO-A. We reanalyzed 701 consecutive echocardiograms of 18 pediatric cardiac transplant recipients (median age at transplantation, 142 days) and based scoring on significant (Z score > or =1) deviation from the patients' baseline means (ECHO-B). Eight episodes of treated rejection occurred during the first year after transplantation (median, 1.4 years). Approximately 10% (72) of the analyses had ECHO-A scores > or =4 that were not associated with treated rejection and were considered false positives. We identified parameters that contributed to the false-positive evaluations and calculated patient-specific baseline mean +/- standard deviation. The ECHO-B, in comparison with ECHO-A, decreased the number of false positives from 72 to 10, increased specificity from 90% to 99%, and increased the positive predictive value about 4-fold (10% to 44%). With treated rejection episodes, ECHO-B increased ECHO-A scores in 7 of 8 recipients and increased the mean score from 6 to 8. analysis algorithm based on change from baseline improved the positive predictive power without reducing the negative predictive value of multiparametric quantitative analyses of echocardiograms following pediatric heart transplantation.

Coronary artery disease is today's most important post-heart transplantation problem after the first perioperative year. Histologically, coronary artery disease is characterized by transplant arteriosclerosis. The current view on this vasculopathy is that vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells from the media of affected arteries proliferate and migrate into the sub-endothelial space (intima) in response to signals from inflammatory cells and damaged graft endothelium. According to this model, the intimal VSM cells in transplant arteriosclerotic lesions should originate from donor tissue. Using recipient-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of microdissected, single, neointimal VSM nuclei, we recently showed that after allogeneic aorta transplantation the neointimal VSM cells are of recipient and not of donor origin. In this study, we analyzed whether VSM-cell replacement with recipient-derived cells also takes place after allogeneic heart transplantation. Cardiac allografts, when transplanted from female donors to male immune-modulated recipient rats, eventually developed transplant arteriosclerosis.

In total, we analyzed 35 VSM-cell nuclei from 3 allografts, and PCR analysis revealed that 30/35 (86%) of the samples displayed the male-specific 128 base pair DNA fragment. These results indicate that after allogeneic cardiac transplantation, at least 86% of VSM cells in transplant arteriosclerotic lesions are of recipient origin.

The mechanisms of intimal thickening in cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) remain controversial after heart transplantation. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) plays a crucial role in degrading extracellular matrix (ECM) during neointimal formation. Recently, it has been revealed that MMP-2 is activated by membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). This process involves tissue inhibitor of MMP-2 (TIMP-2), forming an MT1-MMP/TIMP-2/pro-MMP-2 complex. In this study, we hypothesize that these components contribute to the pathogenesis of CAV. Heterotopic cardiac allografting was performed in randomly paired Japanese monkeys with an immunosuppressive regimen of intravenous administration of antihuman CD18 monoclonal antibody. The donor hearts were harvested at Days 22, 28, 40, 41, and 95 posttransplantation. We examined expression of MMP-2, MT1-MMP, and TIMP-2 of graft vessels using immunohistochemistry and protein level by western blot analysis. Pathologically, various degrees of neointimal formation were observed. In the allografts harvested at Days 22, 28, 40, and 41, MT1-MMP was expressed in the endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in media of some arteries without histological change, accompanied by expression of MMP-2 and TIMP-2. In the severely thickened neointima of the allograft harvested at Day 95, MMP-2 and faint MT1-MMP were expressed in SMCs of severely thickened neointima and media; TIMP-2 expression was seen only in noncollagenous tissue of severely thickened neointima. MMP-2 protein was more intensely expressed in the allograft harvested at Day 95 than in the allograft harvest at Day 41, while TIMP-2 protein level was almost same in the 2 samples.

Mean creatinine increased (171+/-42 and 164+/-35 micromol/liter, p = 0.01) with allopurinol, whereas it tended to decrease with sulfinpyrazone (160+/-35 and 154+/-48 micromol/liter, p = NS). Mean urea did not change with allopurinol (14+/-5 vs. 15+/-7 mmol/liter, p = NS), but fell with sulfinpyrazone (14.01+/-5 vs. 12.60 +/-5 mmol/liter, p = 0.0004). Mean CsA levels were constant with allopurinol (193+/-73 vs. 188+/-65 ng/ml, p = NS), although CsA dose was slightly reduced (2.7+/-0.8 vs. 2.6+/-0.8 mg/kg/day, p = 0.007). Conversely, CsA levels dropped with sulfinpyrazone (183+/-89 vs. 121 +/-63 ng/ml, p = 0.0001) despite an increase in CsA daily dose (2.6 +/-0.9 vs. 2.8+/-0.9 mg/kg/day, p = 0.0001). Two subjects were treated for acute rejection. We observed no other side effects. In HT recipients sulfinpyrazone, as an alternative to allopurinol, is effective in achieving metabolic control of hyperuricemia. However, this drug reduced CsA levels, thus the risk of rejection is present.

The authors performed a comparative analysis of 60 whole blood samples containing cyclosporine (CsA) from heart transplant (HTx) recipients (n = 60) by the two \"specific\" monoclonal immunoassays, enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) and fluorescence polarization immunoassay (S-FPIA), using the Altman-Bland approach based on graphical techniques and simple calculations. The CsA blood concentrations measured by S-FPIA [mean (SD): 268.1 (108.8) ng/mL] showed a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001) from the corresponding concentrations measured by EMIT [219.6 (118.7) ng/mL]. The CsA concentrations were 27% (median) higher when determined by monoclonal S-FPIA than by EMIT. The comparison between EMIT and S-FPIA showed a good correlation (S-FPIA conc. (ng/mL) = EMIT conc. (ng/mL) x 0.88 + 76.1, r = 0.96, P < 0.001). However, a high correlation does not mean that the two methods agree, and their use as interchangeable might be misleading. The authors summarized the degree of agreement by calculating the bias estimated by the mean difference (d) and the standard deviation of the difference (SD). For CsA concentration data, the mean difference (S-FPIA minus EMIT) is +49.9 ng/mL and SD is 31.2 ng/mL. Altman-Bland analysis indicates considerable lack of agreement between EMIT and S-FPIA, with discrepancies of more than 100 ng/mL. The present study's data clearly show that there is a considerable and clinically unacceptable lack of agreement between the S-FPIA and the EMIT techniques in HTx recipients for the whole range of concentrations evaluated (25-500 ng/mL), and this is caused by the variation in the overestimation of the CsA parent compound. Even though a similar CsA reference range was reported during maintenance therapy for both methods (150-250 ng/mL), which might encourage their interchangeability in the clinical setting, this approach should be avoided. Laboratory reports should always state both the concentration of CsA and the analytical method. ", "label": 0}{"text": "Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair in cardiac transplant recipients.

Seven endurance-trained HTR (mean +/- SD; age 39.7 +/- 12.8 yr) and seven endurance-trained healthy, age-matched control subjects (HC) (mean age 40.6 +/- 10.7 yr) performed a symptom-limited incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer. Venous blood samples were obtained at rest, exercise, and during recovery and analyzed for plasma levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) as well as markers of blood antioxidant capacity. After exercise and during recovery, all dependent measures were corrected for plasma volume changes induced by exercise. Significance was established at (P < 0.05). No group differences existed in plasma levels of MDA at rest. Further, graded exercise did not alter plasma levels of MDA in either group. Resting erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity was significantly lower and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was higher in HTR compared with HC. Finally, at rest, no group differences existed in plasma GPX activity or vitamin E levels. Graded exercise to fatigue does not promote an increase in oxidative stress in blood of exercise trained HTR.

In an attempt to evaluate the influence of cyclosporin A (CsA) on fibroblast metabolism, the phospholipase C beta1, (PLC beta1) nuclear expression was evaluated in fibroblasts from heart transplantation patients treated with CsA who exhibited gingival overgrowth (GO) and from controls. PLC beta1 was assessed by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry means. Findings did not show any difference in terms of PLC beta1 expression between the 2 groups when fibroblasts were incubated in media without CsA, while the addition of CsA highly stimulated the fibroblasts from CsA-treated patients compared to controls. The abnormal fibroblastic response in CsA-treated patients was detected both in cells from enlarged gingival sites and in cells from clinically healthy gingival sites. These results do not explain whether the exaggerated reactivity to in vitro CsA is the consequence of a genetically transmitted susceptibility to CsA that identifies those subjects at risk for developing GO, or whether it is a secondary effect of the long-term in vivo exposure to CsA. However, the present data underline the lack of any close relationship between enhanced fibroblast activity and clinical signs of GO and support the hypothesis that some other factors, together with CsA, are involved in the pathogenesis of CsA-induced GO.

We have shown that microvascular changes that promote fibrin deposition in human cardiac allografts adversely affect clinical outcome. However, some allografts exhibit phenotypic changes in capillaries following the deposition of fibrin, which subsequently provide a significant survival advantage. The mechanism(s) involved in these capillary changes is(are) unknown. Similarly, although we have shown a significant temporal relationship between microvascular fibrin deposition and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) immunoreactivity in cardiac allografts, the cellular source and relative changes in VEGF gene expression under these conditions are not known. Using immunocytochemical techniques, biopsies devoid of fibrin deposition lacked detectable VEGF immunoreactivity, whereas biopsies with fibrin deposition showed VEGF immunoreactivity in cardiocytes, interstitium, and some microvessels. By in situ hybridization, biopsies without microvascular fibrin deposition showed faint VEGF hybridization signals confined primarily to cardiocytes. In biopsies with fibrin deposition, strong VEGF hybridization signals were detected in cardiocytes, arteriolar smooth muscle cells were occasionally labeled, and endothelial cells were rarely labeled. By quantitative RT-PCR, biopsies with fibrin deposition (n=5) relatively expressed approximately three-fold more VEGF mRNA than biopsies without fibrin deposition (n=5 P=0.02). Serum VEGF titers also were greater (P=0.01) in recipients with fibrin deposition (372.9+/-66.7 pg/ml n=18) compared to recipients without fibrin deposition (172.1+/-25.0 pg/ml n=16). Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that increased myocyte-derived VEGF production following microvascular fibrin deposition in transplanted human hearts may act in a paracrine manner to promote activational and phenotypic changes in capillaries that provide a survival advantage for the allografts.

This study was designed to compare ischemic preconditioning with opening of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels and Na(+)/H(+) exchange inhibition in an isolated heart model of cold storage, simulating the situation of cardiac allografts. Sixty-seven isolated isovolumic buffer-perfused rat hearts were arrested with and stored in Celsior solution (Imtix-Sangstat) at 4 degrees C for 4 hours before a 2-hour reperfusion. Group I hearts served as controls and were arrested with and stored in Celsior solution. In group II, hearts were preconditioned by two 5-minute episodes of global ischemia, each separated by 5 minutes of reperfusion before arrest with Celsior solution. Group III hearts were arrested with and stored in Celsior solution supplemented with 100 micromol/L of the mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel opener diazoxide. In group IV, hearts received an infusion of diazoxide (30 micromol/L) during the first 15 minutes of reperfusion. Group V hearts underwent a protocol combining both interventions used in groups III and IV. In group VI, hearts were arrested with and stored in Celsior solution supplemented with 1 micromol/L of the Na(+)/H(+) exchange inhibitor cariporide. Group VII hearts received an infusion of cariporide (1 micromol/L) during the first 15 minutes of reperfusion. In group VIII, hearts underwent a protocol combining both interventions used in groups VI and VII. Group IX hearts were ischemically preconditioned as in group II, and sustained Na(+)/H(+) exchange inhibition during both storage and early reperfusion was used as in group VIII. On the basis of comparisons of postischemic left ventricular contractility and diastolic function, coronary flow, total creatine kinase leakage, and myocardial water content, values indicative of improved protection were obtained by combining ischemic preconditioning with Na(+)/H(+) exchange inhibition by cariporide given during storage and initial reperfusion. The endothelium-dependent vasodilatory postischemic responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine or acetylcholine and endothelium-independent responses to papaverine were not affected by these interventions. These data suggest that cardioprotection conferred by the Na(+)/H(+) exchange inhibitor cariporide is additive to that of ischemic preconditioning and might effectively contribute to improve donor heart preservation during cardiac transplantation.

Cardiac vagal predominance increases the RR interval and RR high-frequency (HF) variability during non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep (stages I through IV) in young subjects. Aging suppresses deep sleep, but effects of age-related changes in sleep architecture on RR are unknown. Whether mechanical effects of changes in the breathing pattern on the sinus node during sleep affect RR variability is unclear. Polygraphic sleep recordings and RR and RR spectral profiles were determined in 8 young (22.5+/-3.3 years) and 8 older (55.0+/-7.3 years) healthy volunteers. HF oscillations in RR of 8 cardiac-denervated heart transplant recipients determined mechanical effects of respiration on the sinoatrial node during sleep. Transition from wakefulness to non-REM sleep increased the RR interval in young and older subjects and increased the HF variability of RR in the young (P:<0.05) but not in the older subjects. Older subjects disclosed a faster RR (P:<0.01) and a lower HF variability (P:<0.05) during non-REM sleep than the young subjects. Aging did not affect light and REM sleep but decreased deep sleep (stage IV) from 39+/-23 to 6+/-6 minutes (P:<0.001). Reduction in sleep stage IV with aging blunted the increase in RR and in RR HF variability during non-REM sleep (r>0.55, P:<0.05). Transition from wakefulness to non-REM sleep doubled the markedly reduced HF variability of RR in the heart transplant recipients (P:<0.05).

We have presently demonstrated that when added to mitral valve replacement (MVR) the corridor procedure is 75% efficient in restoring and maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF), caused by rheumatic mitral valve disease, (follow up 13.9months). In the same patient population, we observed that the typical day-night cycle heart rate (HR) variations were lost and our present study concentrates on this subject. Heart rate variability analysis based on 24-h Holter ECG recording (StrataScan 563 DelMar Avionics) or hospital discharge (12th-14th postoperative days) was performed in 3 patient groups: Group I: Patients with a Corridor procedure added to MVR (12pts, m/f 10/2, mean age 47.3+/-7.5yr); Group II (control): with patients MVR performed through the left atrial approach, without additional antiarrhythmic procedures (10pts, m/f 3/7 mean age 51.5+/-6.7yr), and Group III: heart transplant recipients (5pts, mean age 46.4+/-11.22yr). We analyzed the hourly heart rate over 24-h period divided into three 8-h segments (07-14h; 15-22h and 23-06h). Statistical comparison of mean hourly heart rate values was made between the three time periods of Holter monitoring. The Corridor procedure performed with mitral valve replacement resulted in conversion of sinus rhythm in 75% of patients (Group I), but postoperative heart rate variability analyses based on Holter monitoring disclosed that the mean heart rate was not statistically significantly difficult between the three 8-h segments of the day-night (P>0.05). The same results were found in the group of patients after heart transplant (P>0.05). The same results were found in the group of patients after heart transplant (P>0.05). In the second group (classical MVR), statistically significant differences in mean HR variation existed between the three 8-h intervals (P<0.05), and although atrial fibrillation occurred postoperatively physiologic circadian heart rate variations were preserved. With the Corridor procedure, both atria were surgically and electrically isolated and chronotropic function of the ventricles was restored by creating a small strip of atrial tissue with isolated sinus node and atrio-ventricular node, connected to the ventricles.

Lung transplantation is proposed for young patients with a severe disease that can be expected to be fatal within less than two or three years. The main indications are chronic respiratory failure induced by chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis or pulmonary fibrosis, and severe primary or secondary (Eisenmenger syndrome) pulmonary hypertension. The type of transplantation, determined after an exhaustive work-up ruling out all contraindications, is generally a single lung transplantation if there is no bronchial infection or two-lung transplantation or heart-lung transplantation in case of bronchiectasis or pulmonary artery hypertension. Survival at 1, 3 and 5 years is 72, 57 and 43% respectively. Transplantation improves exercise capacity, quality of life and lung function. It normalizes hematosis in case of chronic respiratory failure and pulmonary hemodynamics in case of pulmonary hypertension. The risk of complications, dominated by infections and rejections, requires careful clinical, functional and endoscopic follow-up. Bacterial infections are frequent during the first weeks. The frequency of opportunistic infections can be reduced by anti-infectious prophylaxis strategies. The rejection can occur as an acute episode, frequent during the first 100 days, or is sometimes asymptomatic. Chronic rejection or obliterating bronchiolitis is the main mid-term complication after lung transplantation and is responsible for the low long-term survival rate with recurrent secondary infections due to frequent bronchial colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Improved prognosis of lung transplantation requires the development of new immunosuppressive agents with lower risk of infection and chronic rejection observed with current treatments.

Thirteen patients undergoing heart transplantation received a DDD pacemaker connected to two epimyocardial leads. Electrograms were recorded and digitized after each endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). The maximum slew rate of the descending slope of the repolarization phase (RSP) was extracted and normalized. A 20% downward shift of RSP from the reference value was considered abnormal. Results of signal processing were blinded during the first 6 months. Eleven patients completed the 6 months blinded period and two patients died. A total of 101 EMB were graded according to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation classification. Grade 3 was assigned to 9 EMB. A significant difference was found between RSP values measured during grade 3 rejection episodes and other RSP values (P < 0.001). A diagnostic model consisting of a single threshold test confirmed the ability of RSP to predict significant signs of rejection on EMB (P < 0.0001). The sensitivity of RSP in detecting grade 3 rejections was 100%, specificity was 81%, negative predictive value 100%, and positive predictive value 35%.

The diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis is easy in cases of seroconversion following a mismatch. However, when the recipient is Toxoplasma-seropositive before transplantation, usual serological techniques do not allow the differentiation between endogenous and organ-related reinfection. The aim of this study was to determine whether western blotting could contribute to this differentiation. Sequential sera from two heart- and one liver- and lung transplant patients whose anti-Toxoplasma antibody titers strongly increased after transplantation, were analyzed by western blotting. Neosynthesized IgG were observed on blots incubated with the sera from two patients who had received transplants from Toxoplasma-seropositive donors, whereas no neosynthesized IgG was detected on blots from the patient who had received a transplant from a Toxoplasma-seronegative donor. Our results suggest that the detection of neosynthesized IgG in the recipient may be related to the recognition of a new parasite strain possibly brought by the transplant from a Toxoplasma-seropositive donor.

Heart transplantation is now currently performed in adult (A-HTR) as well as in pediatric cardiac patients (P-HTR). In A-HTR, heart denervation results in a delayed, blunted heart rate (HR) response to exercise onset, mainly sustained by the level of circulating catecholamines. At the offset of exercise HR resumes the pre-exercise level in 5-25 min, depending on the absolute work intensity. Peak HR is approximately 140 beats/min. Maximal aerobic power is 19 O2/kg x min, i.e., approximately 60% than that of healthy age-matched sedentary subjects and exercise tolerance is therefore reduced. A functional impairment at the muscle level may also be present, as suggested by the slow kinetics of the VO2 readjustment (phase II) at the onset of submaximal aerobic exercise. P-HTR generally behave as A-HTR. However, recently, in a few P-HTR a fast HR response to exercise and greater peak HR values (172 +/- 22 beats/min) were demonstrated. Maximal aerobic power of P-HTR was 32 +/- 7 ml O2/kg x min, greater than that of A-HTR, but yet approximately 60% of that of healthy age-matched controls.

To determine the efficacy of rate-responsive pacing on peak heart rate and exercise capacity, the authors studied eight male heart transplant recipients (age 57 +/- 12 years; 23 +/- 9 months after transplantation) that had either atrial or dual-chambered pacemakers. All subjects completed two maximal graded exercise tests (GXT) using the Naughton treadmill protocol. During the first GXT, pacemakers were programmed for bradycardia support only and without rate responsiveness (unpaced). After a 14-day regimen of beta blockade with metoprolol to nullify the influence of circulating catecholamines on heart rate, subjects performed the second GXT with pacemakers programmed to respond optimally in the rate-responsive mode (paced). Peak heart rate (149 versus 129 bpm), peak oxygen uptake (18.9 versus 15.4 mL/kg/min), treadmill time to exhaustion (14.6 versus 12.4 min), and minute ventilation (76.7 versus 66.2 L/min) were significantly increased (P < or = 0.05) during the paced versus unpaced GXT. The results of this study demonstrate that chronotropic support of the transplanted heart using a rate-responsive pacemaker, with activity-based sensors programmed for maximal sensitivity, improves both peak heart rate and exercise capacity in heart transplant recipients significantly more than circulating catecholamines alone.

After resuscitation, a miniaturized pulsatile ventricular assist device for the mechanical replacement of heart function was implanted. The biventricular assist device (\"Berlin Heart\") consists of two extracorporeal pneumatically driven polyurethane blood pumps, with a multi-layer flexible membrane that separates a blood and an air chamber. Four silicon cannulae connect the blood pumps to the patient. A three-leaflet valve prevents blood reflux. The pumps are driven by a pulsatile electropneumatic system. In 12 of the 15 children the bridging to transplantation was successful with a support time of 1 to 98 days (mean 24 days). Nine of them were extubated and mobilized while assisted. Three children died during the support time due to hemorrhage, sepsis, and pulmonary failure. In addition, there was one infarction of the arteria cerebri media. To date seven of the transplanted children are in good condition on follow-up. The beneficial effects of ventricular assist device use are well known in adult patients and with special devices it can be transferred to infants and children in whom longer need for support is anticipated. Even in small infants it is an effective method for bridging to cardiac transplantation.

The 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors lovastatin and simvastatin have been associated with rhabdomyolysis in cardiac transplant recipients. Herein, we report a case of a 52-year-old male recipient of a cardiac transplant who developed rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure caused by simvastatin precipitated by multiple drug interactions. The patient had a history of cardiac transplantation (5 years before) and presented with a 2-day history of dark urine preceded by 2 weeks of diffuse myalgias. He had been maintained on cyclosporine throughout the entire post-transplant period. Simvastatin was added and pravastatin was discontinued 2 months before admission. Two weeks before the onset of muscle symptoms, digoxin and verapamil were started for new-onset atrial fibrillation. Creatinine phosphokinase levels peaked at 950,000 IU with serum creatinine of 3.3 mg/dL (baseline, 1.8 mg/dL). Review of the medication history indicates a temporal association between the addition of 3 drugs (simvastatin, verapamil, and digoxin) to the medication regimen already containing cyclosporine and the episode of rhabdomyolysis. All of these drugs are cytochrome P450 3A4 and/or P-glycoprotein substrates that are known from previous pharmacokinetic studies to individually produce substantial increases in levels of simvastatin. We believe this case illustrates that avoiding the use of drugs that are cytochrome P450 3A4 and/or P-glycoprotein substrates reduces the risk of rhabdomyolysis caused by 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors.

Right heart failure after heart transplantation represents a life-threatening complication. When conventional therapy including NO-inhalation fails the only choice to reach sufficient haemodynamic conditions may be the implantation of a right ventricular support system. In all cases the Biomedicus centrifugal pump was implanted by cannulation of the right atrium and pulmonary artery. Since March 1989 950 heart transplant procedures were performed at our center. In nine cases (7 male, 2 female, mean age 52 years) implantation of a right ventricular support system was necessary because of deterioration of right ventricular function. The implantation was carried out in 7 cases immediately after transplantation, in 2 cases after 2 days. The support time ranged from 4-348 hours. Six patients could be weaned, 2 patients underwent retransplantation and died and 1 patient died on the support system. Three of the six weaned patients died in the further course because of multiorgan failure. Mechanical right ventricular support is often the only therapeutical tool to reach adequate haemodynamic conditions in post-transplant right heart failure. The Biomedicus centrifugal pump provides good conditions in these cases. Weaning is often possible after short-term support.

Treatment with the hyaluronan-degrading enzyme, hyaluronidase, reduces rejection-induced interstitial edema of transplanted organs. Hyaluronidase has also been demonstrated to reduce tissue necrosis after experimentally induced myocardial infarction, but its clinical use has been limited by an observed interaction between heparin and hyaluronan. In the present work, we investigated whether it is also possible to retain the effect of the enzyme in heparinized animals. Day 5 after heterotopic heart transplantation, recipient rats received a 2-hour intravenous infusion of hyaluronidase, either of ovine or of bovine origin. Concomitantly, the animals received intravenous heparin, either as 2 bolus doses or as a constant infusion. Both hyaluronidase preparations effective reduced the hyaluronan content as well as the water content of the rejecting cardiac grafts. The concomitant use of heparin did not hamper the positive results, neither when heparin was administered intermittently nor when it was given continuously.

Transplant-associated coronary artery disease or cardiac allograft vasculopathy is the major complication after cardiac transplantation. Here we discuss the role of antibodies and antibody-mediated activation of endothelial cells in the pathogenesis of this disease. Clinical and experimental studies have both described an association between chronic production of antibodies after transplantation and development of TxCAD. Although anti-HLA antibodies have been described in some cases, our studies suggest that antibodies against endothelial cells, for example, vimentin, are closely associated with disease development. It is known that indirect presentation of antigens, derived from the graft, probably drive chronic rejection. Here we are suggesting that minor antigens, released from damaged parenchymal cells within the graft, are responsible for the chronicity of the antibody response after transplantation. To date, only vimentin has been identified, but there may be a multiplicity of antigens. It is known that antibodies against endothelial cell surface molecules such as MHC class I and ICAM-1 can activate vascular cells (endothelial and smooth muscle cells) leading to exacerbation of the inflammatory response within the vessel wall. It remains to be seen whether antibodies against cytolytic proteins, released as a result of cell damage, cause cell activation; it may be that these antibodies are involved in clearance of apoptopic cells released from the graft.

In the cytokine-enriched environment of the chronically rejecting allograft, nitric oxide (NO) is predominantly produced by the inducible isoform of NOS synthase (NOS2) expressed by recipient-derived infiltrating immune cells as well as donor-derived vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. Early and persistent upregulation of NOS2 in allografts with cardiac allograft vasculopathy and downregulation of NOS2 coinciding with immunosuppressive attenuation of cardiac allograft vasculopathy have suggested NO as a regulator of cardiac allograft vasculopathy, the hallmark of chronic rejection. Pathogenetically, the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy can be divided into an early phase, characterized by endothelial dysfunction, and a later phase, characterized by structural changes of vessel wall morphology. Several lines of evidence have shown that NO might play an essential role in both phases. Endothelial dysfunction due to immune-mediated injury of endothelial cells has been suggested as an early response-to-injury event in the pathogenesis of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Functional studies in human transplant recipients have documented endothelial dysfunction of coronary artery vessels. Administration of L-arginine, the precursor of NO, improved endothelial function of both epicardial coronary arteries and coronary microvasculature indicating a protective effect of NO. To assess the impact of NO on the development of late structural changes, the severity of cardiac allograft vasculopathy was assessed in mice with targeted deletion of NOS2. A significant increase of vascular occlusion in NOS2-knockout mice demonstrated an antiarteriosclerotic effect of NOS2. In part, this effect could be explained by reduced neointimal smooth muscle cell accumulation after alloimmune injury. Taken together, NO plays an important role in maintaining vessel integrity after transplantation. Disruptions in NO pathways seem to play a key role in the progression from endothelial dysfunction to structural changes. ", "label": 0}{"text": "Endothelin and cardiac transplantation.

These peptides possess many biological activities, such as vasoconstriction and mitogenesis, and are involved in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes in humans. Elevated plasma levels of endothelin have been associated with heart failure, and increased immunoreactivity for endothelin is observed in transplant coronary artery disease.

Fibrin deposits are found in and around the vessels in transplant coronary artery disease, in spontaneous atherosclerosis, and in the microvasculature of failing cardiac allografts. Fibrin is deposited due to a failure in anticoagulant pathways, one of the most important being the heparan sulfate proteoglycan-antithrombin (AT) natural anticoagulant pathway. A failure in this pathway results in a loss of AT binding in veins and arteries and increased fibrin deposition. This is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease and graft failure. Recovery of the previously lost vascular AT binding is associated with the development of a novel binding of AT by capillaries. The development of capillary AT binding is associated with significantly less coronary artery disease and improved survival. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the development of this unusual binding of AT by capillaries is important in developing new treatments directed to promote microvascular AT binding and reduce the deposition of fibrin.

Growing evidence suggests that vascular remodeling processes contribute significantly to the amount of luminal obstruction in coronary artery disease. Recently changes in vascular geometry in the form of positive (compensatory enlargement) as well as negative remodeling (constrictive changes) could be demonstrated in transplanted hearts as well. For further characterization intravascular ultrasound provides an excellent insight into time-related changes (by serial follow-up examinations) and into longitudinal spatial relationships within vessels (motorized pullback with 3-D reconstruction). Focused on time-related changes a decrease in total vessel volume within the first year after transplantation as compared to a slight compensatory enlargement in patients 'late' after HTX could be demonstrated. Regarding focal luminal obstruction, local constrictive changes (negative remodeling) were identified to be the most important predictor of severity of stenosis. It is concluded that changes in vascular geometry are of major importance in focal stenosis as well as in a general luminal loss of coronary arteries within transplanted human hearts.

Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is the major long-term problem after heart transplantation. However, the assumption, mostly based on experimental animal data, that human CAV is an immune-mediated diffuse concentric intimal proliferation with progressive, homogenous vessel narrowing, involving equally epicardial arteries and the microcirculation, leading inevitably to ischemic organ failure and death, does not adequately reflect the complexity of the clinical setting. CAV in humans is much more characterized by a very heterogeneous pattern concerning pathogenetic mechanisms (e.g., immune activation, ischemia-reperfusion injury, CMV infection, hyperlipoproteinemia), protective mechanisms (e.g., remodeling, endothelium-derived vasodilators), endothelial dysfunction, morphological manifestations, involvement of the microcirculation, temporal appearance, disease progression and prognosis. Thus, clinicians have to deal with several clinical dilemmas of the disease, which can be summarized in three simple questions: how can CAV be detected/diagnosed, how can CAV and related events be predicted, and finally how can CAV be prevented and treated.

In vivo studies with IVUS demonstrated that transplant vasculopathy may present with a very heterogeneous morphology suggesting a dual etiology of transplant coronary artery disease. The high incidence of donor-transmitted atherosclerosis and its role in further progression of CAV could be demonstrated by the use of IVUS. Beside intimal hyperplasia, adaptive remodeling processes of vessel and lumen geometry may have physiologic and prognostic importance. IVUS is so far the only method that allows the evaluation of compensatory enlargement and shrinkage of coronary vessels in CAV. IVUS investigations allow the assessment of CAV progression in early angiographically not visible stages. The influence of different medical treatment regimens on CAV progression can be quantified.

Graft arteriosclerosis (GA) is characterized as a diffuse, usually concentric, proliferative lesion of uncertain pathogenesis that occurs in the coronary arteries of cardiac allografts involving both the microvasculature and epicardial vessels, and represents the major limitation to long-term recipient survival. The whole length of the vessel is affected, including small distal intramyocardial branches, which precludes optimal treatment with routine revascularization procedures. The prevalence of GA at 5 years after transplantation is high. Early diagnosis of GA is limited by the lack of clinical symptoms for ischemia in the denervated allogaft, by the insensitivity of coronary angiography, which frequently underestimates the extent and severity of the disease, and by the exclusive or predominant involvement of small intramyocardial vessels in some cases. The introduction of intracoronary ultrasound imaging supports earlier pathological data indicating that coronary angiography underestimates the severity of the disease. The use of intracoronary ultrasound has improved the early diagnosis of large vessel disease, but it lacks accessibility to distal lesions; thus, the extent of intramyocardial small artery disease remains relatively unexplored. Although it has been proposed that EMB could provide useful information on the diagnosis and development of allograft vasculopathy, less attention has been focused on the small intramyocardial vessels, as they appear in the endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), nor on the significance of the myocardial pathology resulting from the perfusion defects caused by GA.

The prevalence of coronary endothelial vasomotor dysfunction is approximately 20-30% during the first year, and 30-40% in the long-term follow-up. Importantly, no association is detectable between endothelial dysfunction and intimal thickness, suggesting two distinct entities of allograft vasculopathy. Early predictors of vasomotor dysfunction are proinflammatory cytokines and endothelin expression. Repetitive subendocardial ischemia during myocardial stress (due to microvascular dysfunction) may result in an impairment of left ventricular function. In non-transplant patients coronary endothelial dysfunction predicts cardiac events during long-term follow-up. It is reasonable that early administration of endothelial-protective compounds is necessary for protection of allograft endothelial dysfunction and vasculopathy during follow-up.

A major impediment to the transplanting of porcine organs into humans is the susceptibility of porcine organs to acute vascular rejection, which can destroy a vascularized xenograft over a period of hours to days. Acute vascular rejection of porcine-to-primate xenografts is thought to be triggered by binding of xenoreactive antibodies to the graft. We tested whether antibodies, binding to Galalpha1-3Gal epitopes in porcine tissue, initiate this phenomenon. Specific depletion of anti-Galalpha1-3Gal antibodies from the blood of baboons, using extracorporeal perfusion of separated plasma through columns of Sepharose beads covalently linked to the antigenic trisaccharide, Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcAc, averted the development of acute vascular rejection in porcine organs transgenic for human decay-accelerating factor and CD59. More importantly, after immunodepletion was stopped and Gala1-3Gal antibodies were allowed to return, these same organs continued to function and remained pathologically normal and thus seemed to achieve a state of accommodation. These results demonstrate that anti-Galalpha1-3Gal antibodies cause acute vascular rejection and suggest that depletion of these antibodies leads to accommodation of the donor cardiac xenograft and could supply an important model for additional study.

Allografts were assessed at POD 90 for the development of GCAD by computer-assisted image analysis to determine intimal:medial ratio and myointimal proliferation. Hyperbaric pressure was an effective method of NF-kappaB TFD delivery (P<0.001 vs. controls). NF-kappaB TFD treatment led to decreased mRNA and protein expression of adhesion molecules. Treatment with NF-kappaB TFD led to a significant decrease in all reperfusion injury parameters compared to saline and NF-SC controls (P<0.01 vs. controls). Higher levels of apoptosis were seen in allografts treated with NF-kappaB TFD compared to control allografts.

This study examined the relationship between cardiac function and cognitive test performance among candidates for heart transplant. Participants were 26 individuals undergoing heart catheterization within one day of completing a battery of cognitive tests. Partial correlation analyses controlling for age and education were used to examine the relationship between cardiac function and cognitive performance. Results replicate previous findings in that increasing hemodynamic pressure variables, e.g., pulmonary artery systolic pressure, were associated with decreased cognitive performance on a measure of psychomotor speed and attention (Trail Making Test-Part A: r=.53). In contrast, cardiac output and cardiac index appeared to be not significantly related to cognitive performance. Taken together, poor performance on cognitive tests among heart transplant candidates appears to be attentionally mediated.

Although ventricular remodeling after long-term unloading of the heart has been reported in patients after the use of medical therapy or left ventricular assist devices, it has rarely been reported in patients after heterotopic heart transplantation. Here, we describe a case of ventricular remodeling of the native heart after heterotopic heart transplantation. A 61-year-old man with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy underwent heterotopic heart transplantation because of high pulmonary vascular resistance and a small donor heart. After the operation, echocardiography showed ventricular remodeling of the native heart, with decreased size and improved contractility of the left ventricle. Six months after the transplantation, acute graft failure of the donor heart occurred. However, the patient remained in good condition with the support of the improved native heart.

Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is an effective technique for providing emergent circulatory assistance. However, its use in adult patients is associated with poor survival when myocardial function fails to recover. Due to the prolonged waiting times for heart transplantation, ECLS as a bridge to transplant is associated with poor survival. In addition, ECLS has been reported to be a significant risk factor for death after bridging to an implantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD). After acquisition of the HeartMate LVAD (Thermo Cardiosystems, Inc) in October 1996, we began using ECLS as a bridge to an implantable LVAD and subsequently transplantation in selected high-risk patients. From October 1, 1996 to December 1, 1999, 60 adult patients presenting with cardiogenic shock were evaluated for circulatory assistance. Twenty-five patients (group 1) with cardiac arrest or severe hemodynamic instability and multiorgan failure were placed on ECLS. Eight patients survived to LVAD implant, 1 was bridged directly to transplant, and 4 weaned from ECLS. Nine patients in group 1 survived to discharge. Thirty patients (group 2) underwent LVAD implant without ECLS. Twenty-three were bridged to transplant, with 22 surviving to discharge. Five patients (group 3) were placed on extracorporeal ventricular assist with 3 bridged to transplant and all surviving to discharge. One-year actuarial survival from the initiation of circulatory support was 36% (group 1), 73% (group 2), and 60% (group 3). One-year actuarial survival from the time of LVAD implant in group 1, conditional on surviving ECLS, was 75% (p = NS compared with group 2). In selected high-risk patients, LVAD survival after initial ECLS was not different from survival after LVAD support alone.

Despite the expression of angiogenic growth factors in transplanted hearts, neovessel formation appears scant. We therefore hypothesized that cardiac allografts contain endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis. In particular, we tested the involvement in cardiac allografts of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a matrix glycoprotein that inhibits angiogenesis and facilitates smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation. Levels of TSP-1 mRNA in endomyocardial biopsy samples of human cardiac allografts substantially exceeded those in normal hearts. The ratio of TSP to GAPDH mRNA determined with quantitative RT-PCR was 6.54+/-1.6 in cardiac allografts versus 0.26+/-0.02 (P:=0.001) in normal hearts. Analysis in sequential biopsies revealed a strong association between persistent elevation of TSP-1 in allografts and the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). The CAV score was 2.4+/-0.8 in patients with persistent TSP-1 elevation compared with 0.2+/-0.2 in patients without elevation (P:=0.001). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated intense expression of TSP-1 in cardiac allografts, predominantly in cardiac myocytes and neointimal SMCs. In vitro experiments demonstrated that T cells expressed TSP-1, acidic fibroblast growth factor, and vascular endothelial cell growth factor on allogeneic stimulation. Cytokines known to be elevated in cardiac allografts (interleukin-1beta, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) induced TSP-1 in SMCs but inhibited TSP-1 in endothelial cells. Persistent elevation of TSP-1 in cardiac allografts correlates with the development of CAV. Allogeneic stimulation induces angiogenic growth factors and TSP-1 in T cells. Cytokines differentially regulate TSP-1 expression in SMCs versus endothelial cells. Increased levels of TSP-1 in human cardiac allografts may alter vascular responses to angiogenic growth factors by inhibiting angiogenesis and promoting SMC proliferation characteristic of CAV.

The load of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of transplant recipients represents a predictive parameter for posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD). The aim of our work was to develop a rapid and reliable PCR protocol for the quantification of cell-associated EBV DNA in transplant recipients. In contrast to previous studies, a protocol that facilitated quantification independent of photometric nucleic acid analysis was established. We took advantage of the real-time PCR technology which allows for single-tube coamplification of EBV and genomic C-reactive protein (CRP) DNA. EBV copy numbers were normalized by division by the amount of CRP DNA, with the quotient representing the actual amount of amplifiable genomic DNA per reaction. Coamplification of CRP DNA did not result in a diminished detection limit for EBV. By using the protocol without normalization, EBV copy numbers in 4 out of 10 PTLD patients were within the normal range determined with data for 114 transplant recipients that served as controls. After normalization, however, all of the PTLD patients had a higher viral load than the control population, indicating an increased sensitivity of the assay. Moreover, EBV copy numbers obtained for one patient by conventional quantification and suggestive of relapsing PTLD were within normal range after normalization. We conclude that normalization of PCR signals to coamplified genomic DNA allows a more accurate quantification of cell-bound EBV.

Rejection of renal and cardiac xenografts is initiated when natural antibodies of the recipient bind to donor endothelium, activating complement on the surface of endothelial cells. Pulmonary xenotransplants, however, reveal less evidence of antibody binding and complement activation and, in contrast to other xenografts, fare worse when the complement of the graft recipient is depleted. Accordingly, we asked whether distinct immunochemical reactions might occur after xenotransplantation of the lung and what implications such reactions might have for pulmonary pathophysiology. Analysis of serum from baboons after transplantation with porcine lungs revealed complexes containing baboon IgM and porcine von Willebrand factor. The baboon IgM in these complexes was specific for Galalpha1-3Gal. Immune complexes were also seen, albeit to a lesser extent, in the serum of kidney and heart xenotransplant recipients. Deposits of porcine von Willebrand factor and baboon C3 were detected in livers and spleens of transplanted baboons. These results indicate pulmonary xenotransplantation eventuates in formation of immune complexes and in the deposition of those complexes at distant sites.

Successful grafting of vascularized xenografts (Xgs) depends on the ability to reliably induce both T cell-independent and -dependent immune tolerance. After temporary NK cell depletion, B cell suppression, and pretransplant infusion of donor Ags, athymic rats simultaneously transplanted with hamster heart and thymus Xgs developed immunocompetent rat-derived T cells that tolerated the hamster Xgs but provoked multiple-organ autoimmunity. The autoimmune syndrome was probably due to an insufficient development of tolerance for some rat organs; for example, it led to thyroiditis in the recipient rat thyroid, but not in simultaneously transplanted donor hamster thyroid. Moreover, grafting a mixed hamster/rat thymic epithelial cell graft could prevent the autoimmune syndrome. These experiments indicate that host-type thymic epithelial cells may be essential for the establishment of complete self-tolerance and that mixed host/donor thymus grafts may induce T cell xenotolerance while maintaining self-tolerance in the recipient.

Previous reports demonstrated that retroviral mediated gene transfer of viral IL-10 (vIL-10) prolongs allograft survival by decreasing donor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor (CTLp) and IL-2-secreting helper T lymphocyte precursor (HTLp) frequency within graft-infiltrating cells (GIC). This report now shows that vIL-10 efficacy is dependent on CD4(+) T cells, suggesting that immunosuppression may involve a switch from a Th1 to a Th2 alloresponse. In support of this, anti-IL-4 or anti-murine IL-10 (anti-mIL-10) mAbs, but not anti-IFN-gamma mAb, administered at the time of vIL-10 gene transfer prevents enhanced graft survival. Because Th switching involves APC function, GIC were examined for their ability to present alloantigen. GIC from vIL-10-treated grafts were shown to be mostly of recipient (CBA) origin, yet were unable to elicit alloproliferative responses from donor type (C57BL/6) or third party (BALB/c) responders. The inability of vIL-10-treated GIC to stimulate the MLR was not due to the generation of negative regulatory cells or the production of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-4, mIL-10, or TGFbeta. Using fractionated GIC subpopulations, the number of recipient type cells in the allografts was modestly reduced by vIL-10 gene transfer, while maintaining both APC phenotype and alloantigen presenting function. Conversely, after vIL-10 gene transfer, donor type GIC were unable to participate in direct alloantigen presentation. Therefore, local immunosuppression induced by vIL-10 gene transfer is CD4 T cell and IL-4 and mIL-10 dependent, and impairs direct alloantigen presentation through an alteration of donor type APC function.

Although it is widely accepted that there is a hierarchy in the susceptibility of different allografts to rejection, the mechanisms responsible are unknown.

Rejection of all three types of graft generate memory cells by 25 days posttransplant. These data provide evidence that neither tissue-specific Ags nor, surprisingly, the number of APCs carried in the graft dictate their susceptibility to T cell-mediated rejection and suggest that the graft microenvironment and size may play a more important role in determining the susceptibility of an allograft to rejection and resistance to tolerance induction.

Functional impairment was assessed with the BOS classification. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the optimal threshold of air trapping to distinguish between patients with and those without BOS and to compute sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing BOS. The extent of air trapping increased with BOS severity (P =.001).

Down-regulation of the principal gap-junctional protein of the ventricular myocytes, connexin43, has previously been implicated in arrhythmia in ischaemic heart disease, but it is not known whether connexin43 is similarly reduced in heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, whether disease-related connexin43 down-regulation occurs at the level of transcription or translation, or whether the expression of other connexin isotypes is altered in congestive heart failure. We therefore investigated the expression of the four connexins expressed in the heart-connexins 43, 40, 45 and 37-at the mRNA and protein levels in explanted hearts from transplant patients with end-stage heart failure (NYHA class 4) by immunoconfocal analysis, and northern and western blotting. Connexin43 mRNA and protein were markedly downregulated in the left ventricle in end-stage heart failure due both to ischaemic cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Connexin43 content was spatially heterogeneous in the diseased ventricle. Connexin40 mRNA was increased in the ischaemic group, more so in the left ventricle than the right. This correlated with an increased depth of connexin40 protein expression in myocytes at the endocardial surface. Connexin45 mRNA and protein, present only in very low quantities, followed a similar trend to connexin43, while connexin37 (exclusively expressed in endothelium) showed no change. Our findings show that congestive heart failure is associated with significantly reduced levels of the principal gap junction protein, connexin43, in the left ventricle, potentially contributing to enhanced arrhythmogenicity and contractile dysfunction. This down-regulation is due predominantly to a reduced transcript steady-state level. Elevated connexin40 may represent a compensatory response that improves the spread of depolarization in the otherwise compromised ischaemic ventricle.

In acute cardiac rejection, changes in myocardial oxygen consumption occur; non-invasive detection of these metabolic changes would have obvious clinical utility. In the classic cervical, heterotopic, canine, transplant model, the heart is non-working. It has a low myocardial oxygen consumption. Creation of a working model with normal myocardial oxygen consumption would enhance validity of non-human studies. Clearance of 11C acetate was determined by positron emission tomography (PET) scanning and compared with myocardial oxygen consumption in normal and transplanted canine hearts. Donor hearts from mongrel dogs (2.5-3 kg; n=4) were transplanted into the neck of adult beagles (12-15 kg; n=4), no immunosuppression was given. Two non-working hearts were modified to eject only coronary flow via the right ventricle. In two hearts, a novel working model was created with aortic regurgitation to load the left ventricle. Working and non-working hearts underwent PET scanning on post-operative days 2 and 4. Normal dog hearts (n=2) and native hearts of transplanted dogs (n=3) were used to validate the scanning technique. Coronary sinus and aortic oxygen saturation data along with myocardial blood flow (radiolabeled microspheres) confirmed that clearance of 11C acetate in normal and transplanted hearts followed a bi-exponential model. Myocardial oxygen consumption was correlated with the rate constant of 11C acetate rapid phase clearance (r=0.91) in normal and transplanted hearts. The working hearts had increased myocardial oxygen consumption compared to non-working hearts.

Upon heterotopic heart transplantation the respective antisera were intravenously (i.v.) injected. Passive transfer of antiheart, antierythrocyte or antilymphocyte serum resulted in hyperacute rejection of the transplanted mouse heart. Subfractionation of the antiheart serum showed that the capacity to induce hyperacute rejection was carried by the immunoglobulin (Ig)G fraction. When antierythrocyte serum adsorbed with mouse erythrocytes was administered the cardiac grafts remained beating. To the contrary, antilymphocyte serum adsorbed with erythrocytes still had the capacity to induce hyperacute rejection. None of the rats that had previously been challenged with the Forssman antigen rejected their grafts hyperacutely. Subsequent investigations by electron microscopy revealed that the Forssman antigen is expressed on dendritic cells (DC) adjacent to the vessels, but not on the vascular endothelium, thus explaining the inability of the anti-Forssman serum to induce hyperacute rejection.

The number of procedures undertaken in 1998 was of 349, indicating slight decrease in transplantation activity in the last year. Nevertheless, the figures are similar and the analysis of the last years shows that the mean annual figure is close to 250 transplants/year. In our country, the mean clinical profile of the patient undergoing transplantation corresponds to a male (82%), aged 48 years (48 +/- 15), blood type A (54%) or 0 (32%), with severe heart disease due to ischemic heart disease (39%) or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (35%). The recorded results have been analyzed globally, thus including all the transplants performed; high risk transplants (urgent, elderly or pediatric receptors, retransplantation, multiple heterotopic transplantation with lung, kidney and liver...) in this analysis. This should be taken into account when comparing the results with other registries. The mean early mortality (first 30 days after transplantation) corresponding to the last 10 years is of 14%. In this period, acute graft failure (35%), multi-organic failure (15%) and infections (10%) constitute the most frequent cause of death. The sum of the results obtained in 1999 and those obtained in former years show survival in the 1st, 5th and 10th year to be of 74, 62 and 47%, respectively. Global mortality is mainly due to infection (18%), acute graft failure (17%) and rejection (11%). We can conclude that, although the number of transplants performed yearly appears to have reached a plateau, the results obtained cannot be considered stable since year after year, thanks to the great experience of the Transplant Units, these results are gradually exceeding the survival levels.

The incidence of chronic heart failure has increased, with a corresponding increase in morbidity and mortality, and has made a substantial financial impact on our society. Improved therapy for heart failure has resulted in a significant prolongation of survival, a decreased number of hospitalizations, and an enhanced quality of life for many patients. It can reasonably be expected, therefore, that adherence to a rational medical regimen for these patients might decrease costs as well. Management of patients with severe heart failure begins with identifying the etiology and educating the patients and their families. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the cornerstone of therapy but only after diagnostic tests are performed to establish the etiology and extent of myocardial dysfunction. Because cardiac transplantation is a therapeutic option for only a limited number of patients, other surgical and medical therapies have to be viewed as the mainstay of a treatment strategy.

Since the early 1980s, a 3-drug regimen that includes cyclosporine, azathioprine, and usually corticosteroids has been the mainstay of immunosuppression for patients undergoing cardiac transplantation. This regimen, however, has a variety of inherent toxicities and is not associated with any lesser incidence of graft coronary artery disease than the earlier regimen. For these reasons, there has been a widely perceived need for the introduction of improved immunosuppressive agents. Two such agents have thus far been introduced into clinical organ transplantation: mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus. Mycophenolate mofetil is used as a substitute for azathioprine and has been shown to result in significantly lower mortality rates and freedom from rejection in heart transplant recipients. Tacrolimus can be used as a substitute for cyclosporine but (at least in the short-term) seems to offer no important advantage in terms of survival or rejection. The combination of these 2 new agents seems to have no short-term disadvantage and longer-term follow-up is pending. ", "label": 0}{"text": "Neoplasia after heart transplantation.

To determine the predictive values of noninvasive tests for the detection of allograft vascular disease.

The diagnosis of allograft vascular disease was made by cine-coronary arteriography, and it was considered as positive if lesions existed that caused > or =50% obstruction of the lumen. Patients underwent 24h Holter monitoring, thallium scintigraphy, a treadmill stress test, and dobutamine stress echocardiography. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were determined in percentages for each method, as compared with the cine-coronary arteriography results. Allograft vascular disease was found in 15 (38%) patients. The Holter test showed 15.4% sensitivity, 95.5% specificity. For the treadmill stress test, sensitivity was 10%, specificity was 100%. When thallium scintigraphy was used, sensitivity was 40%, specificity 95.8%. On echocardiography with dobutamine, we found a 63.6% sensitivity, 91.3% specificity. When the dobutamine echocardiogram was associated with scintigraphy, sensitivity was 71.4%, specificity was 87%.

Each patient had bilateral anterior chamber cells. Biopsy of an iris nodule from a patient who had undergone cardiac transplantation confirmed the diagnosis of PTLD, but no signs of systemic PTLD were found. The other 2 patients had systemic PTLD after liver transplantation; 1 presented with iris nodules in both eyes and a subretinal mass in the left eye, while the other had bilateral anterior chamber cells only.

Interleukin-18 (IL-18) and IL-12 have been shown to play an important role in the induction of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). IFN-gamma induces the proliferation of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells and augments the Th1 immune cascade. The role of IL-18 and IL-12 in the induction of IFN-gamma following allogeneic heart transplantation has not been described. We sought to characterize the IL-12 and IL-18 response to murine allogeneic heart transplantation, particularly with respect to IFN-gamma production and histologic transplant rejection. Forty-eight heterotopic heart transplants were performed in two groups of mice: syngeneic C3H/HeN to C3H/HeN mice and allogeneic BALB/C to C3H/HeN mice. Transplants were followed out to 2, 6, 10, and 14 days. Six transplants were performed in each group. Serum and splenic samples were used to evaluate the cytokine response by ELISA. Explanted heart tissue was processed for evidence of histologic rejection, and RT-PCR was performed to evaluate the IL-12, IL-18, and IFN-gamma signal qualitatively. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), Fisher's projected least significant difference (PLSD) was used for statistical analysis. Transplant rejection occurred in the allogeneic group histologically by day 6 and clinically by day 10. Serum IFN-gamma levels rose significantly by day 6 in the allogeneic group and then continued to rise in the splenocyte cultures. Serum IL-18 also rose significantly in the allogeneic group at day 6 compared with syngeneic group. RT-PCR revealed that the allogeneic tissue contained an increased signal for IL-12, IL-18, and IFN-gamma beginning at day 6 and peaking at day 10 after transplant. Beginning 6 days after transplantation, IL-12 and IL-18 appear to play a significant role in the induction of IFN-gamma in allogeneic heart transplants.

A procoagulant microvasculature is associated with accelerated development of coronary artery disease (CAD) and failure in heart transplant patients. This study was performed to evaluate how changes in natural anticoagulation within cardiac allografts affect outcome. We prospectively studied 141 consecutive cardiac allograft recipients who underwent transplantation between 1988 and 1997. Serial endomyocardial biopsy specimens (6.5 +/- 0.1 biopsy specimens/patient) obtained during the first 3 months after transplantation were studied immunohistochemically to evaluate vascular antithrombin, and annual coronary angiograms (3.8 +/- 0.2 angiograms/patient) were studied to evaluate CAD. Antithrombin was present in arteries and veins, but not in capillaries, of all donor heart biopsy samples. Allografts that maintained vascular antithrombin had the best prognosis. Allografts with early and persistent loss of vascular antithrombin (n = 21) developed CAD earlier (p < 0.001), developed more severe disease (p < 0.001), showed more disease progression (p < 0.001), and failed more often (p = 0.003) and earlier (p < 0.001) than allografts retaining normal vascular antithrombin (n = 45). However, allografts that lost and recovered vascular antithrombin while developing unusual capillary antithrombin binding (n = 75) had less CAD, developed CAD later, had less severe disease and less disease progression (p < 0.01), and failed less often (p = 0.01) and later (p = 0.03) than allografts with persistent loss of vascular antithrombin.

The invasive nature of endomyocardial biopsy has led to a search for alternative diagnostic modalities for the detection of cardiac allograft rejection. To date, no non-invasive test meets all the requirements for the detection of acute and chronic rejection. The rejection process usually presents with lymphocyte infiltration with or without myocyte necrosis, which indicates the severity of cardiac allograft rejection and the necessity of treatment. Activated lymphocytes express somatostatin receptors; thus somatostatin receptor imaging could be used to target them. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of using somatostatin receptor imaging to target activated lymphocytes in the process of cardiac allograft rejection. Thirteen somatostatin receptor imaging studies were performed on ten cardiac allograft recipients 12-4,745 days after transplantation, simultaneously with endomyocardial biopsy, to assess the imaging of activated lymphocytes in comparison with histological findings. Somatostatin receptor imaging was performed 4 h after the injection of 110 MBq of the somatostatin analogue indium-111 pentetreotide. 111In-pentetreotide uptake was visually scored and semi-quantitatively estimated by the calculation of a heart-to-lung ratio (HLR). The visual score correlated with the HLR. Intense/moderate uptake on visual assessment and an HLR >1.6 was observed in eight studies. In three of these studies there was significant rejection in the simultaneous endomyocardial biopsy [International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) rejection grade 3A/4]. Intense/moderate uptake was associated with mild or no rejection in the remaining five patients, and in four of them the next endomyocardial biopsy performed 1 week later demonstrated significant rejection requiring treatment. Two patients with low uptake and an HLR <1.6 had no evidence of rejection either in the simultaneous endomyocardial biopsy or in the endomyocardial biopsy performed the following week. These preliminary results indicate the feasibility of targeting activated lymphocytes with somatostatin receptor imaging in the detection of cardiac allograft rejection. Somatostatin receptor imaging may predict impending rejection at least 1 week before the endomyocardial biopsy becomes positive. The late appearance of diagnostic endomyocardial biopsy probably reflects a lag-time between lymphocytic activation and induction of myocyte damage. Furthermore, somatostatin receptor imaging at 4 h may in any case allow earlier intervention in the event of rejection, given the time required for histological processing of endomyocardial biopsy.

Mechanical support for the failing heart has interested and challenged cardiac specialists for decades.

This retrospective review describes our 5-year clinical experience at the Brigham and Women's Hospital with the Abiomed BVS 5000 as a means of ventricular support. During the period of 1994 to present, 7,428 cardiac surgical operations were performed at our institution. The Abiomed BVS 5000 has been implanted in 47 patients exhibiting ventricular failure. There were 38 patients in the bridge-to-recovery group and nine patients in the bridge-to-transplantation group. Twenty-five patients (66%) in the bridge-to-recovery group were weaned and 16 patients (42%) went on to discharge. In the bridge-to-transplantation group, one patient actually recovered myocardial function and one expired on the device. The remaining seven patients (77%) underwent cardiac transplantation with post-transplant survival at 66%. Overall, patients were supported in the isolated left ventricular mode (28%), in the biventricular mode (45%) and in the isolated right ventricular mode (28%). The Abiomed BVS 5000 has been shown to be a safe and simple cardiac support system with no mechanical failure.

Starling's law is a description relating the energy released by the contracting ventricle to the end diastolic fiber length. The peak systolic pressure during isovolumic contraction is an example of this relationship; Sunagawa and coworkers (12) termed that pressure Pmax. It may also be estimated during ejecting beats. Here we compare the variable Pmax at a given end diastolic volume with that of end systolic elastance as an indicator of ventricular function, changes in either being indicative of changes in the inotropic state of the heart. We specifically investigate 2 points on the end systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) plot: 1) the Pmax, EDV point, obtained from the concept of the maximum pressure, Pmax, the pressure an isovolumically contracting ventricle would produce at a given end diastolic volume (EDV); and 2) the end systolic pressure, end systolic volume point. Both points would be expected to shift proportionally with changes in the slope of ESPVR. Data were obtained from 2 published reports in humans in the literature and from a group of 5 dogs subjected to a wide range of preloads and afterloads. High correlations (>0.9) were obtained for changes in the slope of ESPVR and the Pmax, EDV points. The latter, a more readily obtainable variable from single ejecting beats, is proposed as a version of Starling's law, the changes in which are directly comparable with the changes in end systolic elastance.

Cheyne-Stokes respiration is characterized by recurrent phases of central apneas during sleep alternating with a crescendo-decrescendo hyperventilation. This abnormal respiratory pattern is often observed in patients with severe congestive heart failure and associated with fragmentation of sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness, and a relatively high mortality. Increased peripheral and central chemosensitivity, prolonged circulation time, and reduced blood gas buffering capacity are the major factors contributing to the pathology. However, the exact pathophysiologic mechanisms are not clear yet. Respiratory stimulants, oxygen and continuous or bilevel positive airway pressure (CPAP or BiPAP) might reduce the severity of Cheyne-Stokes respiration but have little effect on daytime sleepiness and cardiac function. There is only limited data supporting the assumption that intensive heart failure therapy has an effect on Cheyne-Stokes respiration. A 55-year-old male patient with dilative cardiomyopathy (NYHA IV) suffered excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale: 24 points). The patient was a heavy snorer with a normal body mass index. Treatment was initiated including ACE-inhibitors, beta-receptor blockers, diuretics and digoxin. The patient underwent sleep analysis with a Somno-Check system which demonstrated Cheyne-Stokes breathing (Respiratory Disturbance Index RDI: 40/h, lowest desaturation 76%) and body position dependent snoring. Oxygen therapy (21/min) had no effect on daytime sleepiness. Due to the cardiac condition, the patient was accepted for heart transplantation. Three weeks after transplantation sleep analysis was repeated and demonstrated a lack of evidence for periodic breathing (RDI 1/h, no desaturations below 90%), while snoring remained unchanged. Daytime sleepiness improved significantly (Epworth Sleepiness Scale: 6 points). Three weeks after normalizing left ventricular function a complete recovery from severe Cheyne-Stokes respiration was observed. Adequate therapy of the underlying cause of Cheyne-Stokes breathing such as end-stage congestive heart failure might sufficiently abolish any breathing abnormalities.

Of these patients, 39 had a cadaver donor and 2 a living-related donor, with ages ranging from 20 days to 35 years. The mean follow-up was 56 months. Graft survival was 74.5% and 70.5% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. The causes of graft lost were acute rejection (4), graft vascular thrombosis (4), and hemolytic uremic syndrome recurrence (1). Only 1 patient has died due to chickenpox. Double and triple immunosuppressive therapies were used in 63% and 37% of patients, respectively, on the basis of different center protocols, without differences in graft survival. Steroids were successfully administered on alternate days in 37% of patients, 6-12 months after transplantation. Thrombosis was reported in 2 of 6 kidneys from donors less than 1 year of age and in 2 of 35 donors older than 1 year (P < 0.05). Thirty rejections occurred in 23 patients: 7 episodes were steroid resistant and were treated with ATG/OKT3. Thirty-four infections were reported in 16 of 41 patients; of these 17 were viral, 14 bacterial, and 3 due to Mycoplasma. Four surgical complications were reported: 1 graft artery stenosis, 1 ureteral stenosis, 1 urinary leak, and 1 lymphocele.

Endothelial dysfunction is an early feature of CAV and progresses over time after transplantation. Early identification of CAV is essential if long-term prognosis is to be improved. Annual coronary angiography is performed for diagnostic and surveillance purposes. Intravascular ultrasound is a more sensitive diagnostic tool for early disease stages and has revealed that progressive luminal narrowing in CAV is in part due to negative vascular remodeling.

Both wild-type (WT) and IFN-gamma-deficient (IFN-gamma(-/-)) C57BL/6 mice can rapidly reject BALB/c cardiac allografts. When depleted of CD8(+) cells, both WT and IFN-gamma(-/-) mice rejected their allografts, indicating that these mice share a common CD4-mediated, CD8-independent mechanism of rejection. However, when depleted of CD4(+) cells, WT mice accepted their allografts, while IFN-gamma(-/-) recipients rapidly rejected them. Hence, IFN-gamma(-/-), but not WT mice developed an unusual CD8-mediated, CD4-independent, mechanism of allograft rejection. Allograft rejection in IFN-gamma(-/-) mice was associated with intragraft accumulation of IL-4-producing cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and eosinophils. Furthermore, this form of rejection was resistant to treatment with anti-CD40 ligand (CD40L) mAb, which markedly prolonged graft survival in WT mice. T cell depletion studies verified that anti-CD40L treatment failed to prevent CD8-mediated allograft rejection in IFN-gamma(-/-) mice. However, anti-CD40L treatment did prevent CD4-mediated rejection in IFN-gamma(-/-) mice, although grafts were eventually rejected when CD8(+) T cells repopulated the periphery. The IL-4 production and eosinophil influx into the graft that occurred during CD8-mediated rejection were apparently epiphenomenal, since treatment with anti-IL-4 mAb blocked intragraft accumulation of eosinophils, but did not interfere with allograft rejection. These studies demonstrate that a novel, CD8-mediated mechanism of allograft rejection, which is resistant to experimental immunosuppression, can develop when IFN-gamma is limiting. An understanding of this mechanism is confounded by its association with Th2-like immune events, which contribute unique histopathologic features to the graft but are apparently unnecessary for the process of allograft rejection.

Osteoporosis and related fractures are a major complication after organ transplantation. The aim of this study was to find out the frequency and predictors of osteoporotic fractures after cardiac or liver transplantation. 235 consecutive patients who had a cardiac transplant (n=105; 88 men, 17 women) or a liver transplant (130; 75 men, 55 women) were followed. Vertebral fractures were assessed by a standardised analysis of spinal radiographs before and annually after transplantation. Clinical and non-vertebral fracture data were noted from hospital records. In the first and second years after transplantation, the proportion of patients (Kaplan-Meier estimates) who had at least one vertebral fracture was slightly higher in the cardiac group (first year 21%, second year 27%) than in the liver group (first year 14%, second year 21%). In the third and fourth years, one third of patients from both groups had had one or more vertebral fractures. Non-vertebral fractures occurred in nine patients (7%) after liver transplantation and avascular necrosis of the hip head in three patients (3%) after cardiac transplantation. In both groups, no dose-dependent effect of immunosuppressive therapy on fracture development could be identified. Independent predictors assessed by multivariate analysis were age (hazard ratio [95% CI] increase of 5 years, 1.71 [1.1-2.7]) and lumbar bone-mineral density (decrease of 1 SD t score, 1.97 [1.2-3.2]) in cardiac transplantation patients, and vertebral fractures before transplantation (6.07 [1.7-21.7]) in the liver group. The high frequency of osteoporotic fractures in the 2 years after transplantation and the limitations of reliable fracture-risk predictions, show the need to investigate preventive therapies.

The chronic shortage in the supply of human organs available for allotransplantation has turned attention toward the use of animals as potential donors, with pigs as the most likely species under consideration. Hyperacute rejection, the initial and immediate barrier to a pig-to-primate xenograft, has been addressed by generation of transgenic pigs that express the human membrane-bound complement-regulatory proteins CD59 and/or CD55. Difficulty has been encountered in generation of transgenic animals that express a third membrane-bound complement-regulatory protein, CD46. We have generated transgenic animals by using a large genomic construct that encompasses the entire human CD46 gene. We report the first description of transgenic mice and pigs that express high levels of human CD46 in a cell and tissue type-specific manner, resembling patterns of endogenous CD46 expression observed in human tissues. Furthermore, when human CD46 transgenic porcine hearts were transplanted into baboons, the grafts did not succumb to hyperacute rejection, and survival extended for up to 23 days. Under the same conditions, nontransgenic grafts underwent hyperacute rejection within 90 min. This is the first report to describe generation of transgenic pigs that express human CD46, and the first in vivo demonstration of the ability of human CD46 expressed on pig organs to regulate complement activation and overcome hyperacute rejection upon transplantation of a vascularized organ into nonhuman primates.

Acute rejection is a common problem in heart transplantation and may contribute to the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. This study was designed to evaluate the mechanisms of coronary endothelial dysfunction associated with ischemia-reperfusion and acute untreated rejection. Two groups of mongrel dogs (n=7 per group) underwent heterotopic cervical heart transplantation without immunosuppression. Allografts were harvested on posttransplant day 1 (group 1) and day 5 (group 2). A third group of unoperated dogs served as control (group 3). After harvesting, epicardial coronary arteries were studied in organ chamber for endothelium-dependent and independent reactivity. Group 1 displayed multifocal ischemic damage without any rejection while hearts from group 2 reached grade IV rejection. Immunohistochemical studies for von Willebrand factor showed expression on coronary endothelial cells in all animals with scattered areas of denudation in transplanted groups. Endothelium-dependent responses to acetylcholine, calcium ionophore A23147, and bradykinin were unaffected in groups 1 and 2. Endothelial relaxations to sodium fluoride (Gi-protein activator) was significantly reduced in group 1 and significantly increased in group 2 compared with control. Responses to serotonin and UK14304 (receptors linked to Gi-protein) were significantly increased in group 2. Responses to thrombin were decreased in both groups. Endothelium-independent responses were unaffected. In the canine model of heterotopic heart transplantation, the early (24 hr) endothelial dysfunction seen after transplantation is specific to the thrombin receptor and the Gi-protein signaling pathway. Acute untreated rejection did not modify the alteration in endothelial reactivity to thrombin but enhanced the sensibility of the Gi-protein signaling pathways.

The widespread use of cyclosporine has improved the survival of cardiac transplant patients as a result of reduced morbidity and mortality from rejection and infection. The original oil-based form of cyclosporine demonstrated unpredictable absorption resulting in an increased frequency of acute and chronic rejection in patients with poor bioavailability. The primary end. points of the present, prospective, randomized multicenter, double-blind trial were to compare the efficacy of the micro-emulsion form of cycolsporine (CsA-NL) with the oil-based formulation as determined by cardiac allograft and recipient survival and the incidence and severity of the acute rejection episodes and to determine the safety and tolerability of CsA-NL compared with Sandimmune CsA-(SM) in the study population. The 6-month analysis of the study showed reduced number of CsA-NL patients requiring antilymphocyte antibody therapy for rejection, fewer International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation grade > or =3A rejections in female patients and fewer infections. Our report represents the final analysis of the results 24 months after transplantation. A total of 380 patients undergoing de novo cardiac transplants at 24 centers in the United States, Canada, and Europe were enrolled in this double-blind, randomized trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of CsA-NL versus CsA-SM. Acute allograft rejection was diagnosed by endomyocardial biopsy and graded according to the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation nomenclature. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Fisher's exact test were used for comparisons between groups. After 24 months, allograft and recipient survival were identical in both groups. There were fewer CsA-NL patients (6.9%) requiring antilymphocyte antibody therapy for rejection than in the CsA-SM-treated patient group (17.7%, P=0.002). There were fewer discontinuations of study drug for treatment failures in the CsA-NL groups (7; 3.7%) compared with the CsA-SM group (18; 9.4%, P=0.037). The average corticosteroid dose was lower in the CsA-NL group (0.37 mg/kg/day) compared with the CsA-SM group (0.48 mg/kg/day, P=0.034) over the 24-month study period. Overall, there was no difference in blood pressure or creatinine between the two study groups. The final results of this multi-center, randomized study of two forms of cyclosporine confirmed that there were fewer episodes of rejection requiring antilymphocyte antibodies and fewer study discontinuations for treatment failures in CsA-NL-treated patients compared to those treated with CsA-SM.

The hamster-to-rat xenotransplantation model is a useful model to investigate the features of extended host response to long-surviving xenografts. Early xenoantibody responses are T-cell independent and resistant to tacrolimus. Treatment with the combination of mofetil mycophenolate plus FK506 avoids acute xenograft rejection completely, but after withdrawal of immunosuppression hamster grafts are rejected by a process called late xenograft rejection (LXR). Hamster hearts and livers were transplanted into Lewis rats. Grafted rats were treated with mofetil mycophenolate (25 mg/kg/day) for 8 days and FK506 (0.2 mg/kg/day) for 31 days. Serum IgM and IgG levels were determined by flow cytometry and interferon-gamma levels by ELISA. IgM, IgG, and C3 deposits were measured in tissue by immunofluorescence, and leukocyte infiltration was measured by immunoperoxidase staining. Results. Survival of heart and liver xenografts in the rats was 48+/-4 days and 63+/-8 days, respectively. After cessation of all immunosuppression, hearts were rejected in 18+/-4 days and livers in 33+/-8 days. Production sequences of xenoantibodies in the two organs differed substantially, especially 7 days after transplantation and at the moment of rejection. Quantification of interferon-gamma levels indicated that there were no significant changes after transplantation. Histological and immunohistochemical studies showed signs of humoral mechanism of LXR in rats undergoing heart transplantation and cellular mechanism of LXR in those that received a liver transplant. Conclusions. These observations suggest that rejection in the hamster-to-rat heart xenotransplantation model is mediated by a T cell-independent B-cell response to which a T cell-dependent B-cell response is added in LXR. In the liver xenotransplantation model, our hypothesis is that LXR is mediated by a mixed cell mechanism, involving lymphocytes CD4+ CD45RC+, macrophages, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In summary, we have demonstrated and compared the peculiar features of LXR in two different organs.

Diabetes developed in 24 of 143 (17%) 30-day survivors of heart (12/96, 13%) and heart-lung/lung (12/ 47, 26%) transplantation. In 17 (71%) patients, the immunosuppressive regimen at the onset of PTDM also included maintenance corticosteroids. Seventeen patients demonstrated glucose intolerance before the onset of diabetes. Nine patients (38%) developed diabetes during pulsed corticosteroid therapy. Median time of onset after transplantation was 9.0 months. All patients required s.c. insulin for glucose control.

Blood cardioplegia was delivered after each anastomosis in both groups and arterial and coronary sinus blood samples were obtained to examine myocardial metabolism. A Millar micromanometer was used to measure left ventricular developed pressure and the rate-pressure product at varying preloads. There were no differences in either myocardial lactate or acid release between the two groups. Hearts in the insulin group displayed higher myocardial oxygen extraction than those in the blood group. The recovery of developed pressure was higher in the insulin group compared to the blood group (91% +/- 19% vs 73% +/- 2%, p = 0.04).

Between November 1985 and November 1999, 347 children underwent cardiac transplantation at the Loma Linda University Medical Center. Of these, 32 children were listed for re-CTx. Ten patients died while waiting, and 22 recipients underwent re-CTx. Median age at re-CTx was 7.1 years (range, 52 days to 20.1 years). Indications for re-CTx were allograft vasculopathy (n = 16), primary graft failure (n = 5), and acute rejection (n = 1). Two patients with primary graft failure underwent retransplantation within 24 hours of the first transplantation procedure while on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Median time interval to re-CTx for the others was 7.2 years (range, 32 days to 9.4 years). Operative mortality for all cardiac re-CTx procedures was 13.6%. Causes of hospital mortality were pulmonary hypertension with graft failure (n = 2) and multiorgan failure (n = 1). Median hospital stay after re-CTx was 14.1 days (range, 6 to 45 days).

Autoimmne mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic ongoing mycarditis. An earlier study of murine chronic ongoing myocarditis reported that infiltrating T cells and macrophages were prominent in the normal donor heart, in a heterotopic cardiac transplantation model. It was demonstrated that myocarditis was transferred to a normal heart transplanted into a mouse with chronic myocarditis. The present study investigated an autoimmune link to the pathogenesis of chronic ongoing myocarditis by analyzing the T cell clonalities in the model. To characterize the accumulating T cells in the donor heart, the T cell receptor beta genes (TCRBG) were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from mRNA in the donor hearts and accumulating TCRBG clonotypes were contrasted with those from recipient hearts. Inbred 3-week-old A/J mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with Coxsackievirus B3 (Nancy strain), 2 x 10(4) PFU, and housed for more than 60 days. Normal A/J mouse hearts were transplanted into the same strain of mice without myocarditis, as well as into the mice with chronic ongoing myocarditis. Both recipient and donor hearts were evaluated histologically 2 weeks after the transplantation. TCRBG were amplified by RT-PCR from mRNA of recipient and donor hearts and spleens. The specific accumulating TCRBG clonotypes were identified by their single strand conformation polymorphism. Multiple clonotypic accumulations occurred in the donor heart after cardiac transplantation. Distinct oligoclonal accumulation of TCR Vbeta1, 10, and 13 T cells was found in both recipient and donor hearts in 3 of 4 mice. Moreover, these clonotypes were not observed in spleen cells of the recipient mice. T specific cells expanding clonotypes of TCRBG are responsible for transferring myocarditis to the donor heart. An autoimmune response may, therefore, play a key role in the progression of chronic ongoing myocarditis. ", "label": 0}{"text": "Acute allograft failure in thoracic organ transplantation. Thoracic organ transplantation is an effective form of treatment for end-stage heart and lung disease. Despite major advances in the field, transplant patients remain at risk for acute allograft dysfunction, a major cause of early and late mortality.

During cold storage and early reperfusion, heart and lung allografts are vulnerable to intracellular calcium overload, acidosis, cell swelling, injury mediated by reactive oxygen species, and the inflammatory response. Brain death itself is associated with a reduction in myocardial contractility, and recipient-related factors such as preexisting pulmonary hypertension can lead to acute right heart failure and the pulmonary reimplantation response.

Cultures were exposed to cold (4 degrees C) storage in UW solution for 6, 8 and 12 h. Parallel cultures were incubated with control medium at 37 degrees C.

Activity of the constitutive endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was measured by the conversion [3H]-l-arginine to [3H]-l-citrulline and eNOS protein expression by Western blotting. Nitrite production by control cells was augmented with increasing times of incubation, whereas no change was observed in those cultures preserved with UW solution. Activity of eNOS was significantly decreased compared to the respective control group by cold storage of cells for longer periods than 6 h. Such decrease was correlated with a diminished eNOS protein expression in CEC preserved with UW solution after 8- and 12-h storage. These results suggest that prolonged hypothermic storage of CEC with UW solution does not preserve basal NO release because of a certain loss of eNOS protein, which may contribute to the reported injury of heart transplants after long-term preservation.

In our series, antigenemia and quantitative-PCR had enhanced and similar predictive values for CMV disease detection when specific cut-off values were used. The choice between these two methods for disease detection may rely less on their efficiency and more on the experience and familiarity with them.

The mechanisms of action of polyclonal antithymocyte globulins (ATGs) are still poorly understood and the selection of doses used in different clinical applications (prevention or treatment of acute rejection in organ allografts, treatment of graft-versus-host disease, or conditioning for allogeneic stem cell transplantation) remains empirical. Low T-cell counts are usually achieved in peripheral blood during ATG treatment but the extent of T-cell depletion in lymphoid tissues is unknown. Experiments were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys using Thymoglobuline at low (1 mg/kg), high (5 mg/kg), and very high (20 mg/kg) doses. ATG treatment induced a dose-dependent lymphocytopenia in the blood and a dose-dependent T-cell depletion in spleen and lymph nodes but not in the thymus, indicating a limited access of ATG to this organ. T-cell apoptosis in peripheral lymphoid tissues was the main mechanism of depletion. Remaining T cells in peripheral lymphoid organs were coated by antibodies and had down-modulated surface expression of CD2, CD3, CD4, and CD8 molecules, whereas their responsiveness in mixed leukocyte reaction was impaired. The survival of MHC-mismatched skin and heart allografts was prolonged in a dose-dependent fashion, despite the occurrence of a strong anti-ATG antibody response resulting in the rapid clearance of circulating ATGs. The results indicate that T-cell depletion is achieved rapidly and primarily in peripheral lymphoid tissues at high ATG dosage. Short ATG treatments could therefore be clinically evaluated when major peripheral T-cell depletion is required.

Nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) is critical for the transcription of multiple genes involved in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Therefore, we hypothesized that blocking NFkappaB would attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury after prolonged myocardial preservation, resulting in an improvement in cardiac function. Double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides with a specific affinity for NFkappaB (NFkappaB decoy group) or a scrambled decoy group were transfected into rat hearts using a hemagglutinating virus of Japan-liposome method. After 16 hours of preservation in Euro-Collins solution at 4 degrees C, the cardiac grafts were heterotopically transplanted into recipient rats of the same strain. Fluorescein isothiocyanate staining showed introduction of double-stranded oligonucleotides into the nuclei of endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. After 1 hour of reperfusion the NFkappaB decoy group showed significantly higher degrees of recovery of left ventricular function as well as significantly lower levels of serum creatine phosphokinase, myocardial water content, tissue IL-8, and neutrophil infiltration than did the scrambled decoy group (p < 0.05). Gene transfection of the NFkappaB decoy attenuates ischemia-reperfusion injury after prolonged heart preservation. As a result, this method appears to be a novel strategy for enhanced myocardial preservation.

To determine the impact of an 8-wk neuromuscular stimulation program of thigh muscles on strength and cross-sectional area in patients with refractory heart failure listed for transplantation. Forty-two patients with a stable disease course were assigned randomly to a stimulation group (SG) or a control group (CG). The stimulation protocol consisted of biphasic symmetric impulses with a frequency of 50 Hz and an on/off regime of 2/6 sec. Primary outcome measures were isometric and isokinetic thigh muscle strength and muscle cross-sectional area. Our results showed an increase of muscle strength by mean 22.7 for knee extensor and by 35.4 for knee flexor muscles. The CG remained unchanged or decreased by -8.4 in extensor strength. Cross-sectional area increased in the SG by 15.5 and in the CG by 1.7. Activities of daily living as well as quality of life increased in the SG but not in the CG. Subscales of the SF-36 increased significantly in the SG, especially concerning physical functioning by +7.5 (1.3-30.0), emotional role by +33.3 (0-66.6), and social functioning by +18.8 (0-46.9), all P < 0.05. Neither a change nor a decrease was observed in the CG.

Provision of adequate T cell costimulation is critical for the development of acute and chronic allograft rejection. We have previously reported that early blockade of CD28-B7 T cell costimulation prevents the development of graft arteriosclerosis, in the LEW into F344 rat cardiac transplant model. In this study, we used the same model to examine the requirement for CD28-B7-mediated T cell costimulation in the progression of established chronic rejection and examined the individual roles of B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) costimulatory molecules. Late blockade of CD28-B7 T cell costimulation by the fusion protein CTLA4Ig, which binds both CD80 and CD86, attenuated the development of transplant arteriosclerosis, mononuclear cell infiltration, and parenchymal fibrosis in this model. Selective blockade of CD80 using the mutant fusion protein Y100F was as effective as CTLA4Ig in this regard. In contrast to CTLA4Ig, blockade of CD80 alone by Y100F was ineffective at preventing early graft loss and prolonging graft survival when given early after transplantation. This study is the first to demonstrate that late blockade of CD28-B7 T cell costimulation interrupts chronic cardiac allograft rejection, and it indicates the importance of continued T cell activation in this process. This study further defines functional differences between CD80 and CD86 costimulatory molecules in vivo.

The cytoplasmic localized Janus tyrosine kinase 3 (Jak3) is activated by multiple cytokines, including IL-2, IL-4, and IL-7, through engagement of the IL-2R common gamma-chain. Genetic inactivation of Jak3 is manifested as SCID in humans and mice. These findings have suggested that Jak3 represents a pharmacological target to control certain lymphoid-derived diseases. Using the rat T cell line Nb2-11c, we document that tyrphostin AG-490 blocked in vitro IL-2-induced cell proliferation (IC(50) approximately 20 microM), Jak3 autophosphorylation, and activation of its key substrates, Stat5a and Stat5b, as measured by tyrosine/serine phosphorylation analysis and DNA-binding experiments. To test the notion that inhibition of Jak3 provides immunosuppressive potential, a 7-day course of i.v. therapy with 5-20 mg/kg AG-490 was used to inhibit rejection of heterotopically transplanted Lewis (RT1(l)) heart allografts in ACI (RT1(a)) recipients. In this study, we report that AG-490 significantly prolonged allograft survival, but also acted synergistically when used in combination with the signal 1 inhibitor cyclosporin A, but not the signal 3 inhibitor, rapamycin. Finally, AG-490 treatment reduced graft infiltration of mononuclear cells and Stat5a/b DNA binding of ex vivo IL-2-stimulated graft infiltrating of mononuclear cells, but failed to affect IL2R alpha expression, as judged by RNase protection assays. Thus, inhibition of Jak3 prolongs allograft survival and also potentiates the immunosuppressive effects of cyclosporin A, but not rapamycin.

We present evidence that donor-reactive CD4(+) T cells present in mice tolerant to donor alloantigens are phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous.

In contrast, the CD45RB(low) CD4(+) and CD25(+)CD4(+) populations failed to induce rejection, but rather, were able to inhibit rejection initiated by naive CD45RB(high) CD4(+) T cells. Analysis of the mechanism of immunoregulation transferred by CD45RB(low) CD4(+) T cells in vivo revealed that it was donor Ag specific and could be inhibited by neutralizing Abs reactive with IL-10, but not IL-4. CD45RB(low) CD4(+) T cells from tolerant mice were also immune suppressive in vitro, as coculture of these cells with naive CD45RB(high) CD4(+) T cells inhibited proliferation and Th1 cytokine production in response to donor alloantigens presented via the indirect pathway. These results demonstrate that alloantigen-specific regulatory T cells contained within the CD45RB(low) CD4(+) T cell population are responsible for the maintenance of tolerance to donor alloantigens in vivo and require IL-10 for functional activity.

Mouse-to-rat cardiac transplants survive long term after transient complement depletion by cobra venom factor and T cell immunosuppression by cyclosporin A. Expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) by the graft vasculature is critical to achieve graft survival. In the present study, we asked whether this protective effect was attributable to the generation of one of the catabolic products of HO-1, carbon monoxide (CO). Our present data suggests that this is the case. Under the same immunosuppressive regimen that allows mouse-to-rat cardiac transplants to survive long term (i.e., cobra venom factor plus cyclosporin A), inhibition of HO-1 activity by tin protoporphyrin, caused graft rejection in 3--7 days. Rejection was associated with widespread platelet sequestration, thrombosis of coronary arterioles, myocardial infarction, and apoptosis of endothelial cells as well as cardiac myocytes. Under inhibition of HO-1 activity by tin protoporphyrin, exogenous CO suppressed graft rejection and restored long-term graft survival. This effect of CO was associated with inhibition of platelet aggregation, thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and apoptosis. We also found that expression of HO-1 by endothelial cells in vitro inhibits platelet aggregation and protects endothelial cells from apoptosis. Both these actions of HO-1 are mediated through the generation of CO. These data suggests that HO-1 suppresses the rejection of mouse-to-rat cardiac transplants through a mechanism that involves the generation of CO. Presumably CO suppresses graft rejection by inhibiting platelet aggregation that facilitates vascular thrombosis and myocardial infarction. Additional mechanisms by which CO overcomes graft rejection may involve its ability to suppress endothelial cell apoptosis.

Mycophenolate mofetil is widely used in combination with either cyclosporine or tacrolimus for rejection prophylaxis in renal and heart transplant patients. Although not monitored routinely nearly to the degree that other agents such as cyclosporine or tacrolimus, there is an expanding body of experimental evidence for the utility of monitoring mycophenolic acid, the primary active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil, plasma concentration as an index of risk for the development of acute rejection. The following are important experimentally-based reasons for recommending the incorporation of target therapeutic concentration monitoring of mycophenolic acid: (1) the MPA dose-interval area-under-the-concentration-time curve, and less precisely, MPA predose concentrations predict the risk for development of acute rejection; (2) the strong correlation between mycophenolic acid plasma concentrations and expression of important cell surface activation antigens, whole blood pharmacodynamic assays of lymphocyte proliferation and median graft rejection scores in a heart transplant animal model; (3) the greater than 10-fold interindividual variation of MPA area under the concentration time curve values in heart and renal transplant patients receiving a fixed dose of the parent drug; (4) drug-drug interactions involving other immunosuppressives are such that when switching from one to another (eg, from cyclosporine to tacrolimus or vice-versa) substantial changes in MPA concentrations can occur in patients receiving a fixed dose of the parent drug; (5) significant effects of liver and kidney diseases on the steady-state total and free mycophenolic acid area under the concentration time curve values; (6) the need to closely monitor mycophenolic acid when a major change in immunosuppression is planned such as steroid withdrawal. Current investigations are focused on determination of the most optimal sampling time and for mycophenolic acid target therapeutic concentration monitoring. Further investigations are needed to evaluate the pharmacologic activity of the newly described acyl glucuronide metabolite of mycophenolic acid which has been shown to inhibit, in vitro, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase.

Mycophenolic acid is reported to provide effective immunosuppression by inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. In an attempt to monitor the biological effects of long-term therapy with mycophenolate mofetil, we measured levels of guanosine 5' triphosphate and adenosine 5' triphosphate in red blood cells (RBCs) of patients after heart transplantations. Fifty-two patients enrolled in the study were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Patients in the control group (n = 27) received cyclosporine A (INN, ciclosporin), azathioprine, and prednisone. Patients in the study group (n = 25) were switched from azathioprine to mycophenolate mofetil 3 months after the heart transplantation. Adenosine 5' triphosphate and guanosine 5' triphosphate levels were determined by means of HPLC. The activities of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, which are responsible for guanine nucleotide formation, were measured in RBCs by radiochemical methods. Adenosine 5' triphosphate levels were unchanged in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, whereas those of the control group who received azathioprine (from 142 +/- 26 pmol/10(6) RBCs to 165 +/- 25 pmol/10(6) RBCs; P <.001) increased. As the length of mycophenolate mofetil therapy increased, patients in the study group showed significantly elevated guanosine 5' triphosphate levels (15.6 +/- 6.1 pmol/10(6) RBCs versus 6.6 +/- 2.1 pmol/10(6) RBCs; P <.001) and a 5-fold increase in inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase activity (108.6 +/- 13.3 pmol/mg of protein per hour versus 22.5 +/- 1.7 pmol/mg of protein per hour; P <.001) compared with the control group.

All patients received immunosuppressive therapy with a combination of corticosteroids and cyclosporin and 10 also received azathioprine. Five patients admitted urgently with calculous acute cholecystitis and one patient with previous gastrectomy underwent laparotomy, while the other 21 patients were operated by laparoscopy. There were no postoperative deaths. In patients operated by laparoscopy, there was no conversion to laparotomy and oral immunosuppressive drugs were continued without interruption.

Graft loss from chronic rejection has become the major obstacle to the long-term success of whole organ transplantation. In cardiac allografts, chronic rejection is manifested as a diffuse and accelerated form of arteriosclerosis, termed cardiac allograft vasculopathy. It has been suggested that T-cell recognition of processed alloantigens (allopeptides) presented by recipient antigen-presenting cells through the indirect pathway of allorecognition plays a critical role in the development and progression of chronic rejection. However, definitive preclinical evidence to support this hypothesis is lacking.

Pigs immunized with swine leukocyte antigen class I allopeptides showed in vitro proliferative responses and in vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to the allogeneic peptides.

A total of 82 cardiac transplant patients, 96 donors and 101 UK controls, were genotyped retrospectively. Nine nucleotide polymorphisms in L-selectin, E-selectin, ICAM-1, and PECAM were analyzed using allele-specific PCR-SSP assay. Recipients were selected on the basis of the development of TxCAD: patients who had developed TxCAD within 2 years after transplantation, and patients who did not have TxCAD within 4.5-5 years after transplantation. All recipients received CyA and azathioprine as a primary immunosuppression. Associations were assessed by using Fisher's exact test. No association was found between E-selectin, L-selectin, and PECAM allele or genotype frequencies and TxCAD. However, the donors whose recipients did not develop TxCAD at first 2 years had a significant increase of ICAM-1 E-469 allele compared with donors, whose recipients developed TxCAD (63.8% vs 46.4%, p = 0.042) and to UK controls (63.8% vs 47%, p = 0.04). Moreover, we found that the decreased frequency of ICAM E469 allele was associated with the increased number of rejection episodes. The 469 E/K polymorphism is in exon 6 and results in a change from glutamic acid to lysine in Ig-like domain 5 of ICAM-1, which is thought to affect interactions with LFA-1 and adhesion of B-cells.

In addition, repeated measurements on samples from kidney and heart transplant recipients with active HCMV infection were examined to compare the temporal development of the HCMV-IgM measured with the five assay systems. Since there is no commercially available gold standard, it was assumed that the true classification, of whether the patient sample is HCMV-IgM positive or negative, was unknown. Hence sensitivity and specificity were assessed based on a maximum likelihood approach using a \"latent class\" model.

The depletion of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in the arteriolar smooth muscle cells has been associated with a higher incidence of accelerated graft atherosclerosis. In vivo overexpression of tPA may inhibit accelerated graft atherosclerosis and improve the long-term results of heart transplantation. We evaluated the feasibility, distribution, and effects of intracoronary transfer of the human tPA (htPA) gene in a rabbit heterotopic cardiac transplant model, using a novel cationic liposome compound designed for improved delivery to vascular endothelium. Human tPA cDNA under the control of the SV40 promoter (100 microg) was complexed with the novel cationic liposome (+/-)-N-(3-aminopropyl)-N,N-dimethyl-2,3-bis(dodecyloxy)-1-propanaminium bromide (GAP: DLRIE) (50 microg), and delivered ex vivo to the donor heart by slow intracoronary infusion. Control hearts received an \"empty\" liposome preparation. Grafts were then implanted into recipient rabbits in the heterotopic cervical position. For the analysis of gene expression, beating donor hearts were collected at 4 days. To examine the effects of htPA expression on graft atherosclerosis, animals received a 0.5% cholesterol diet for 30 days posttransplant, as well as 10 mg/kg cyclosporine A daily. Beating hearts were collected at 30 days posttransplant and analyzed for the development of transplant atherosclerosis by image analysis. Northern blot analysis for the htPA messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts showed significantly higher counts in hearts receiving the htPA gene as compared to controls. The distribution of these transcripts favored the left ventricle (LV) and septal regions over the right ventricle (RV). Scintillation analysis of specimens stained by immunoflourescence showed expression of htPA throughout the perivascular myocardium that was significantly higher in grafts transduced with the htPA gene than in control or native hearts. Expression in the vascular wall was also significantly enhanced. Scintillation counts per x 200 field were 262 +/- 145 in htPA-transduced hearts and 20 +/- 27 in controls (p = 0.001), and mean luminescence was 83.7 +/- 12.5 in htPA-transduced hearts and 62.9 +/- 12.8 in controls (p = 0.01).

These results demonstrate that expression of the htPA gene can be induced by ex vivo intracoronary gene transfer at the time of allograft preservation.

RAD is a novel macrolide with potent immunosuppressive and antiproliferative activities. This study characterizes the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of two different single oral doses of RAD in stable lung and heart/lung transplant recipients with and without cystic fibrosis (CF). This was a Phase I, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, two-period, two-sequence, crossover study. Single doses of RAD capsules at doses of 0.035 mg/kg (2.5 mg maximum) or 0.10 mg/kg (7.5 mg maximum) were administered with cyclosporine (Neoral [cyclosporine, USP] modified), steroids, and azathioprine on Day 1. The alternate dose was administered on Day 16. Laboratory assessments, vital signs, and adverse events were recorded throughout the study. RAD pharmacokinetic profiles were assessed over a 7-day period following each dose. Steady-state cyclosporine (CsA) profiles were assessed at baseline and with each RAD dose; RAD and CsA trough concentrations were obtained throughout the study period. Of the 20 patients randomized, 8 had CF and 12 did not. Single doses of RAD were safe and well tolerated. Headache was the most common side effect. RAD produced a mild, dose-dependent, reversible decrease in platelet and leukocyte counts. Cholesterol and triglycerides were minimally affected. At both doses, CF patients had significantly lower peak concentrations of RAD than did non-CF patients (p = 0.03); however, overall exposure (area under the curve/dose) was not different between the groups (p = 0.63). At the higher dose, there was a clinically minor under-proportionality in AUC, averaging -11%. Steady-state pharmacokinetics of CsA were not affected by RAD co-administration.RAD was safe and well tolerated by stable lung and heart/lung transplant recipients with and without CF. The presence of CF did not influence the extent of RAD exposure. Single doses of RAD did not affect the pharmacokinetics of CsA. Ongoing studies are assessing the long-term safety and efficacy of RAD in lung and heart/lung transplantation.

ICAM-1 and P-selectin are molecules that facilitate adhesion of circulating leukocytes to vessel walls. We have investigated the role of donor-derived ICAM-1 and P-selectin in acute and chronic cardiac allograft rejection. C57BL/6J (H-2(b)) mice were used as donors for heterotopic heart transplantation into CBA/Ca (H-2(k)) recipients. The donors were wild-type or homozygous for gene mutations of ICAM-1 or P-selectin. We measured acute rejection in non-immunosuppressed recipients by daily palpation and sacrificed mice at Days 2, 4, and 6 for immunohistochemical analysis. For chronic rejection, recipients received monoclonal antibody against CD4+ T cells. We removed hearts at Days 60 to 62 for histologic assessment of vasculopathy using quantitative morphometry to measure intimal thickening. Time (days) to rejection was 7.1 +/- 0.57 for wild-type (n = 10), 7.0 +/- 0.71 for ICAM-1 -/- (not significantly different, n = 7) and 6.1 +/- 0.33 (p = 0.001) for P-selectin -/- donors. ICAM-1 deficiency was associated with delayed infiltrate at Day 4 compared with wild-type. In the model of chronic rejection, elastin-positive vessels showed a mean occlusion of 34% +/- 3% in transplanted wild-type hearts; vessels were divided into those showing 0% to 20%, 20% to 50%, and 50% to 100% occlusion. We observed no difference in the number of affected vessels or the amount of vascular thickening in donors lacking ICAM-1 or P-selectin compared with wild-type controls. The absence of ICAM-1 or P-selectin in donor tissues neither lengthens the time of allograft survival nor inhibits the vascular lesions associated with chronic rejection. Indeed, the absence of P-selectin may exacerbate alloimmune injury.

Auxiliary cardiac support using heterotopic heart transplant is of considerable interest, but the outcome is not known. To investigate technical feasibility and the possibility of using auxiliary support from heterotopic heart transplantation without cardiopulmonary bypass, we evaluated hemodynamics including the pressure-volume relationship in experimental animals. In heterotopic heart transplantation, we tailored the donor heart by removing the pulmonary and tricuspid valves, and by wide removal of the inter-atrial septum. Next, we anastomosed the descending aorta and left atrium of the donor heart to the descending aorta and left atrium of the recipient, without using cardiopulmonary bypass. Consequently, declamping the recipient's descending aorta allowed the donor heart to fill with blood and to start beating. We performed hemodynamic assessments including the effects of adrenergic stimulation. We measured the pressure and volume relationship of the recipient heart by closing and opening inflow of the donor left atrium to change the pre-load of the donor left ventricle. The donor left ventricle produced a systolic blood pressure that was augmented by the recipient blood pressure and responded to adrenergic stimulation. When inflow of the donor left atrium was opened, the pressure-volume loop of the recipient heart shifted to the left and pressure-volume area decreased. Simultaneously, the mechanical efficiency and E(max) (the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship) of the recipient heart increased when inflow of the donor left atrium was opened. This transplant model, without cardiopulmonary bypass, is feasible and can be applied to transplant investigations as a working heart model on the basis of the response of adrenergic stimulation. The increased pre-load of the donor left atrium from the recipient left atrium resulted in a recipient leftward shift of the pressure-volume relationship, suggesting that this transplant model with adequate pre-load acts as auxiliary assistance in the recipient intrathoracic cavity.

Giant cell myocarditis causes essentially irreversible fulminant left ventricular dysfunction with associated conduction abnormalities and congestive failure. Response to immunosuppressive therapy is poor and cardiac transplantation is the only viable treatment option. The histologic hallmarks of giant cell myocarditis include a polymorphous inflammatory response with numerous multinucleated giant cells and extensive myocyte necrosis in a geographic pattern. There were 38 patients who received a cardiac transplant for giant cell myocarditis in the Giant Cell Myocarditis Registry. Among these patients, there were 9 recurrences of disease in the allograft. Concern has been expressed that recurrence of giant cell myocarditis in the allograft might be a contraindication for cardiac transplantation in the future. In our single-center analysis we describe the clinical and histologic findings of 5 patients transplanted for giant cell myocarditis at the Cleveland Clinic. All but 1 of the patients were New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 4 with an average cardiac index (CI) of 1.52 liters/min x m(2). Of the 5 patients transplanted, 1 developed recurrent giant cell myocarditis. Routine right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy at 1 week exhibited severe multifocal myocardial fibrosis in addition to mild acute vascular rejection and mild grade 1A cellular rejection. Follow-up biopsy in this patient indicated grade IIIA moderate acute rejection in addition to multinucleated giant cells. Two distinct inflammatory processes were noted consisting of foci of T-cell inflammation identified by immunohistochemistry to be consistent with rejection, and a second inflammatory process with few mononuclear cells staining for macrophage or T-cell markers with eosinophils and myocyte necrosis consistent with giant cell myocarditis. Follow-up right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies (RVBXs) in this patient have subsequently demonstrated improvement in the degree of inflammatory infiltrate without vascular or significant cellular rejection. Vascular rejection was noted in 1 of the remaining 4 patients and was treated successfully with muramab-CD3 and plasmapheresis. Giant cell myocarditis should be expected to recur in the allograft and often does so concurrently with rejection. However, the disease in the allograft responds to therapy in a favorable manner, which differs dramatically from that in the native heart. This might be the result of detection of the disease at an earlier stage than in the native heart, or the immunosuppression milieu in the allograft. The favorable response to therapy suggests that the likelihood of recurrence of giant cell myocarditis should not be considered a barrier to transplantation.

Postoperative coronary angiography revealed 25% stenosis of the left descending artery. He showed several episodes of minimal or moderate rejection postoperatively, and coronary angiography 15 months postoperatively showed rapidly accelerated cardiac allograft vasculopathy demonstrating triple vessel disease with multiple lesions. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was successful on 2 coronary vessels, but immediately recurrent stenosis and new lesions involving the left main trunk occurred 6 weeks thereafter.

Butanedione monoxime (BDM) is a reversible myosin ATPase inhibitor. Its use in transplantation medicine may be of benefit in the preservation of hearts. As little is known about its ability to prevent stress and metabolic deregulation, we wanted to investigate the genomic response in cultured cardiomyocytes and explanted, preserved hearts at the transcriptional level. We thus investigated the gene expression of the transcription factors GATA-4, Nkx2.5, MEF-2c, and Oct-1 and of the downstream target genes atrial and brain natriuretic peptide, alpha- and beta-myosin heavy chain, alpha-cardiac actin, and alpha-skeletal actin. Additionally, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase enzyme activities were measured as markers for membrane integrity and metabolic deregulation of cardiomyocytes. In untreated cardiomyocyte cultures, expression of GATA-4 and Nkx2.5 was increased 7- and 4-fold, 72 hr after isolation, but the gene expression of MEF-2c and Oct-1 was reduced to 10% and 70%, at day 3 in culture. We show atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide gene expression to be maximal 24 and 72 hr after isolation, the level being 3- and 2-fold, when compared with freshly isolated cells. The gene expression of alpha- and beta-myosin heavy chain was reduced to approximately 30% at day 3 in culture and similar observations were made for alpha-cardiac and alpha-skeletal actin, which declined to approximately 20% and 10% of control values, 72 hr after isolation. BDM prevented at the transcriptional level enhanced expression of markers for stress and metabolic deregulation, and the activities of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase were highly significantly reduced. Similar results were obtained when explanted hearts were stored in BDM-containing organ preservation solution. Preservation of metabolic function in donor organs is of critical importance in transplantation medicine, and we show gene markers for stress and metabolic deregulation in cultures of cardiomyocytes and explanted hearts to be significantly reduced by BDM. Reprogramming of gene expression of nuclear transcription factors and downstream target genes may prolong the acceptable storage time between explantation and transplantation.

Hearts from C57BL/10(H2b) mice were transplanted into CBA(H2k) recipients.

Relatively little is known concerning the regulation of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) in the heart.

Direct comparisons were made between cardiac and skeletal muscle. UCP-2, UCP-3, and PPARalpha expression were reduced when cardiac workload was either increased (pressure overload by aortic constriction) or decreased (mechanical unloading by heterotopic transplantation). Similar results were observed during cytokine administration. Reduced dietary fatty acid availability resulted in decreased expression of both cardiac UCP-2 and UCP-3. However, when fatty acid (the natural ligand for PPARalpha) supply was increased (high-fat feeding, fasting, and STZ-induced diabetes), cardiac UCP-3 but not UCP-2 expression increased. Comparable results were observed in rats treated with the specific PPARalpha agonist WY-14,643. The level of cardiac UCP-3 but not UCP-2 expression was severely reduced (20-fold) in PPARalpha-/- mice compared to wild-type mice. These results suggest that in the adult rodent heart, UCP-3 expression is regulated by PPARalpha. In contrast, cardiac UCP-2 expression is regulated in part by a fatty acid-dependent, PPARalpha-independent mechanism.

Four years prior to transplantation, a 14-year-old boy with severe haemophilia A and a high-responding factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitor developed an anteroseptal myocardial infarct while receiving high doses of an activated prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC). Cardiac transplantation was required for survival because of the ensuing cardiomyopathy. At surgery, the patient's inhibitor titre was 1.8 Bethesda units (BU). High-dose bolus therapy, followed by a continuous infusion of FVIII provided excellent operative and initial postoperative haemostasis without additional blood-product support. Once anamnaesis developed on day 6 postoperatively, recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) therapy was initiated. Haemostasis remained excellent, except for the transient increase in chest-tube bleeding that was noted on day 7. epsilon-Aminocaproic acid was added and haemostasis was re-established. On day 15, rFVIIa was replaced with alternate day infusions of prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and side-effects of tacrolimus in pediatric transplant patients previously receiving cyclosporin A (CsA). This study was a retrospective chart review strengthened by a concomitant patient interview. Eleven pediatric cardiac or renal transplant patients, who had been converted from CsA to tacrolimus from October 1995 to January 1999 at The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, were included; there were six renal and five cardiac transplant patients. Each chart was reviewed to assess transplanted organ function pre- and post-conversion. For the six renal transplant patients, creatinine levels and biopsy findings were evaluated. For the five cardiac transplant patients, cardiac catheterization and routine biopsy data were analyzed likewise. Epstein Barr virus (EBV) status was also evaluated in each patient. In addition, each parent or patient was interviewed to ascertain dates of transplant, current medications, and side-effects. The patients' ages ranged from 6 to 20 yr (mean age 14.6 yr). All patients had been converted to tacrolimus. Eight patients were converted for treatment of refractory rejection, two were converted because of CsA-associated side-effects, and one patient was converted empirically for a history of multiple previous transplant rejections. Seven out of eight patients who received tacrolimus for rejection therapy improved. One patient had complete resolution of gingival hyperplasia. Another patient who previously developed hemolytic uremic syndrome on CsA had no further evidence of hemolysis. Four patients were weaned off steroid therapy. Despite conversion, two renal transplant patients progressed to chronic rejection. Five patients exhibited no side-effects. Side-effects experienced included transient hyperglycemia in conjunction with steroid use, headaches, and tremors that subsided rapidly. Four of 11 patients developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). Fortunately, reducing the dose of tacrolimus and/or surgical resection of the mass (if present), eradicated the disease. In conclusion, conversion therapy successfully provides an alternate treatment for acute rejection. It also enabled some patients to discontinue steroid therapy, maximizing growth potential. PTLD is a severe, potentially life-threatening complication that needs to be recognized and monitored closely. In conclusion, tacrolimus has been shown to be a very effective agent for the treatment of refractory organ rejection, but must be used cautiously.

Patient groups consisted of patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy or ischaemic heart disease. Cardiac donors served as control group.

Kidneys from very old donors can be used successfully when a pre-transplant biopsy shows a modest degree of glomerular injury. Kidneys from donors of 50 years or more, or with a history of hypertension and diabetes, or other evidence of renal disease, currently not accepted for single' kidney transplantation, provide excellent function when transplanted together.

Split-liver transplantation, i.e. sharing one liver between an adult and a pediatric recipient, is becoming routine procedure and has the potential for meeting the need for liver replacement among children without interfering with adult waiting list. Splitting the liver for transplantation in two adults is a further step forward in the more efficient use of hepatic grafts from cadaver donors. Adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation can further alleviate the pressure in the waiting list, but the risk for the donor must not be underestimated. The decrease in the number of heart-lung transplants in favour of more single and double lung transplants has also made more hearts and more lungs available.

Surgery may reduce wall tension but the reason for dilation and contractile dysfunction remains. Thus, the potential benefit of the operation may be overshadowed by the natural course of the underlying disease. We report a series of five cases where left ventricular reduction was performed and physiological geometry was restored in patients with DCM by a modification of Dor's endoventricular patch plasty. All patients demonstrated an improvement in cardiac function immediately after the operation. This improvement was sustained in one of the patients at 18 months follow-up. Another patient developed severe heart failure due to therapy resistant ventricular arrhythmia (Lown IVb), and underwent successful transplantation 4 months after ventricular reduction surgery. Left ventricular dilation reoccurred in two patients 9 and 12 months after reduction surgery, and they were listed for transplant.

Peak VO2 is an objective marker of functional capacity and is routinely used as a criterion to identify heart transplant candidates. Diastolic dysfunction limits functional capacity, but its prognostic importance relative to that of peak VO2 is unknown.

We sought to investigate whether acute rejection and CMV infection demonstrated as CMV antigenemia had an effect on the cell profiles of peripheral blood (PB), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL-F), or TBB histology. In this prospective study, composition of cells in PB, BAL-F, and TBB samples from 20 lung or heart-lung transplantation patients were analyzed during episodes of acute rejection or CMV antigenemia. Rejection was graded according to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation criteria. As controls, samples with no evidence of rejection or infection were used. To evaluate the effect of time on cellular findings, samples were divided into three groups according to time after transplantation: 1--30, 31--180, and more than 180 d after transplantation.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a myocardial disease, often familial, that is characterized by fibro-fatty replacement of the right ventricular (RV) myocardium. The most common clinical manifestations of ARVC consists of ventricular arrhythmias of RV origin, which may lead to sudden death mostly in young people and athletes, electrocardiograph depolarization/repolarization changes mostly localized to right precordial leads, and global and/or regional dysfunction and structural alterations of the RV. The diagnosis of ARVC may be difficult due to several problems with the specificity of the electrocardiograph abnormalities, the different potential etiologies of ventricular arrhythmias with a left bundle branch morphology, the assessment of the RV structure and function, and the interpretation of endomyocardial biopsy findings. Therefore, standardized diagnostic criteria have been proposed by the Study Group on ARVC of the European Society of Cardiology. According to these guidelines, the diagnosis of ARVC is based on the presence of major and minor criteria encompassing electrocardiograph, arrhythmic, morphofunctional, histopathologic, and genetic factors. Because the assessment of sudden death risk in patients with ARVC is still not well established, there are no precise guidelines to determine which are the patients who need to be treated and which is the best management approach.

Device selection has historically been supported by minimal comparative data. Since 1994, we have implanted 43 patients with the CardioWest Total Artificial Heart (CW), 23 with the Novacor Left Ventricular Assist System (N), and 26 with the Thoratec Ventricular Assist System (T). This experience provides a basis for our device selection criteria. We reviewed retrospectively the results for survival, stroke, and infection in the CW, N, and T groups. Statistical methods included the Student's t-test, chi2 analysis, and Kaplan-Meier actuarial survival curves. The T group patients were younger and smaller sized than the CW or N group. The CW group had the highest mean central venous pressure (CVP) and lowest mean cardiac index. Survival to transplantation was 75% for CW, 57% for N, and 38% for T. Multiple organ failure postimplant caused most deaths in the CW and T groups. Right heart failure and stroke caused most N deaths. Linearized stroke rates (event/patient-month) were 0.03 for CW, 0.28 for N, and 0.08 for T. Serious infections were found in 20% of CW, 30% of N, and 8% of T patients, but linearized rates showed little difference and death from infection was rare. The N device should be used in \"stable\" patients with body surface area (BSA) greater than 1.7 m2 and with minimal right heart failure.

A variety of sophisticated devices have been developed for mechanical circulatory support in patients bridged to cardiac transplantation. Based on 13 years' experience, we have developed specific protocols for patient selection and management for different devices. The principal systems applied in the bridge-to-transplant cohort are the Thoratec ventricular assist device (n = 144, mean duration of support 53 +/- 57 days), the Novacor left ventricular assist system (LVAS) (n = 85, mean duration of support 154 +/- 15 days), and the HeartMate LVAS (n = 54, mean duration of support 143 +/- 142 days). The Thoratec device is used for biventricular assistance or if the duration of support is expected to be less than 6 months. For long-term support, either the Novacor or HeartMate LVAS are preferred. Despite careful postoperative patient management, this group of patients is prone to a variety of complications. Bleeding occurred in 22% to 35%, right heart failure in 15% to 26%, neurologic disorders in 7% to 28%, infection in 7% to 30%, and liver failure in 11% to 20% of patients. Complications varied with the device applied and the patient's preoperative condition. A total of 73 patients were discharged from hospital for a mean period of 184 days; this cumulative experience amounted to 37.5 patient-years.

Between November 1994 and March 1998, 52 patients aged 49 days to 16.9 years (median age 4.7 years) underwent thoracic organ transplantation (32 primary and 4 repeat heart, 16 primary and 4 repeat lung, and 3 primary heart-lung transplants). Acute graft failure occurred in nine (4 heart, 3 lung, 2 heart-lung transplants), six of whom were supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and four of whom underwent repeat transplant. Six of the nine survived, including all of those who were retransplanted, and five of the nine were alive 1 year later. The average postoperative hospital stay after receiving a second organ was 46.5 days vs. a postoperative 22-day stay in recipients without AGF (p = 0.07). We conclude that the decision to allocate institutional and professional resources to the aggressive support of patients with AGF must be made at the level of the individual transplant center. However, we feel that the outcome of aggressive support and retransplantation justifies the allocation of organs to these patients and suggests that the current policies governing organ allocation for patients with early graft failure should be re-examined.

Organ allografts contain passenger leukocytes that are transferred to the recipient with the transplantation, but their functional relevance to the recipient's immune system is still controversial. To clarify the functional capacity of passenger leukocytes, we attempted to enhance their effect in rat heart allograft recipients by selective depletion of recipient leukocytes using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against a recipient-specific allotype of CD45 (RT7(a)). Although antibody treatment of the recipient alone led to profound lymphopenia and reversible myelosuppression, additional transplantation of an major histocompatibility complex-incompatible heart graft from an RT7(b) donor led to lethal aplastic anemia in the recipients. This lethal effect was completely abrogated by postoperative anti-CD3 treatment of the recipient and was partially abrogated or delayed by depletion of passenger leukocytes through additional anti-RT7(b) antibody treatment of the recipient or gamma-irradiation of the graft. The results suggest a role for both donor and recipient-type T cells for the induction of aplastic anemia in this model.

The purpose of the clinical evaluation was to evaluate the applicability of a single BIA equation to predict FFM in pre- and posttransplant patients and to compare FFM and FM in transplant patients with healthy controls. Pre- and posttransplant liver, lung, and heart patients (159 men, 86 women) were measured by two methods-50-kHz BIA-derived FFM (FFM(BIA)) by Xitron instrument and DXA-derived FFM (FFM(DXA)) by Hologic QDR-4500 instrument-and compared with healthy controls (196 men, 129 women), aged 20 to 79 years.

The study shows that the lower weight seen in transplant men and women than in controls was due to lower FFM, which was partially offset by higher FM in men but not in women. Furthermore, the higher weights in posttransplant than in pretransplant patients were due to higher FM and % FM that was confirmed by lower FFM/FM ratio in posttransplant patients.

Nitric oxide production via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is believed to play a role in cardiac allograft rejection. Previously, we showed that antioxidants can significantly prolong cardiac graft survival, but the nature of this protection is unknown. In the present study, we examined the protective effect of another antioxidant, dimethylthiourea (DMTU), in a model of cardiac allograft rejection. Specifically, we hypothesized that DMTU would prolong graft survival and decrease activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), an important redox-sensitive transcription factor necessary for iNOS gene expression. NF-kappa B was activated by twofold as early as postoperative day 2 in allografts. NF-kappa B activation in allografts progressed to a peak of ninefold by postoperative day and remained increased until postoperative day 6. No activation of NF-kappa B was observed in isografts for comparable time periods. Treatment with DMTU resulted in a significant prolongation of graft survival. This beneficial effect was associated with diminished activation of myocardial NF-kappa B. Treatment with DMTU also resulted in decreased formation of iron-nitrosylprotein complexes as evidenced by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. These studies provide evidence that reactive oxygen plays a significant role in signal transduction for activation via the transcription factor, NF-kappa B, thereby modulating distal actions and consequences of iNOS-derived nitric oxide.

Because cardiac transplantation entails neuronal decentralization, cardiac responses to a psychological stressor in transplant patients would be expected to rely on circulating hormonal factors and therefore to be delayed and prolonged. We tested this prediction by comparing stress responses after transplantation with those in patients with coronary artery bypass grafts (to control for experience of surgery) or heart failure (to control for heart disease). Fifty-six transplantation patients, 66 bypass patients, and 40 patients with heart failure underwent a 10-minute, computer-generated, Stroop color-word conflict test. Heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were recorded continuously for 1 minute before, during, and 12 minutes after the stressor. Emotional state was measured periodically by questionnaires. All hemodynamic variables were increased by the Stroop test. There was a pattern of blunted response to the Stroop test after cardiac transplantation, particularly in comparison with bypass patients, and slower recovery in comparison with both control groups. Emotional stress responses were similar in each group. This pattern cannot be attributed to the experience of major heart surgery or to cardiac disease. Nor can it be explained by differences in central processing of stress. Correspondingly the changed hemodynamic response to the Stroop test after cardiac transplantation evidently does not affect patients' emotional responses. The hemodynamic findings are consistent with an increased reliance on hormonal rather than neuronal hemodynamic regulation after cardiac transplantation.

CD4+ T cell effector function is sufficient to mediate allograft rejection, and it is suggested that CD8+ T cell-mediated effects are dependent on CD4+ T cell help. CD8+ T cells can be classified into at least two functional subsets: Tc1, producing high amounts of interferon (IFN)-gamma and Tc2, producing interleukin (IL)-4, -5, -10, and -13 and low levels of IFN-gamma. Because these subsets express different chemokine receptors, they may have different capabilities of migrating into grafts. Once in the graft, each subset may perform different effector functions dependent on the cytokines it produces. We asked whether allospecific CD8+ T cells, in the absence of CD4+ T cells, are capable of mediating rejection of a primarily vascularized allograft, and if Tcl and Tc2 cells differ in their ability to mediate rejection. Hearts from H-2d mice were transplanted into H-2b RAG 1-/- recipients. Without manipulation, these fully mismatched allografts would survive indefinitely due to the absence of mature T and B cells. We adoptively transferred allo-(H-2d)-reactive Tcl or Tc2 cells from H-2b mice into each recipient. Grafts were harvested and analyzed on predefined timepoints, rejection was graded on a modified ISHLT scale. On day 7, grafts from Tc1- or Tc2-injected animals showed grade 1-2 parenchymal rejection with stable phenotype and comparable distribution of graft infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Adoptive transfer of IFN-gammahigh Tc1, but not of IFN-gammalow Tc2 cells was followed by the development of graft vasculitis, as well as graft arteriopathy. Adoptive transfer of IL-4high IL-5high Tc2, but not of IL-4low IL-5low Tc1 cells lead to extensive infiltration of eosinophils and formation of giant cells. Both Tc1 and Tc2 cells can mediate murine cardiac allograft rejection in the absence of CD4+ T cell help, although each subset elicits a different type of inflammatory response. In this model, cytokine secretion of either functional CD8+ T effector cell subset is an important effector mechanism in the process of allograft rejection: IFN-gammahigh Tc1 cells are important in early graft vasculitis, although IL-4high IL-5high Tc2 cells promote recruitment of secondary effectors like eosinophils.

Animals treated with a single low dose injection of CsA showed no significant prolongation of graft survival compared to controls (11.7 vs. 10.5 days).

In this study, oxidative metabolism and its relation to cardiac work were compared in allografts and normal and failing hearts, and the effects of sympathetic reinnervation were evaluated. Twenty-seven nonrejecting, symptom-free transplant recipients, 11 healthy control subjects, and 10 patients with severe dilated cardiomyopathy underwent PET with (11)C acetate for assessment of oxidative metabolism by the clearance constant k(mono) and radionuclide angiography or MRI for measurement of ventricular function, geometry, and work. Efficiency was estimated noninvasively by a work-metabolic index [WMI=(stroke volumexheart ratexsystolic pressure)/k(mono)].

The present study was undertaken to investigate association between intragraft and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) TIRC7 mRNA levels and cardiac allograft rejection in humans. TIRC7 gene expression levels were determined by a quantitative-competitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (QC-RT-PCR) in endomyocardial biopsies and in PBMC from cardiac transplant recipients. Biopsies collected during rejection or up to 15 days before rejection showed heightened TIRC7 mRNA expression in comparison with biopsies without rejection. All prerejection and rejection biopsies showed TIRC7 mRNA upregulation, while this was present in only 30% of the biopsies without rejection. Regarding TIRC7 mRNA in PBMC, transplant recipients showed lower levels than healthy individuals and, in contrast to the results obtained in biopsies, the levels were lower during rejection than in rejection-free periods. In summary, TIRC7 mRNA expression levels increase in biopsies and decrease in peripheral blood during acute cardiac rejection. We conclude that intragraft detection of TIRC7 transcripts is a useful tool not only for the diagnosis but also for the prediction of acute heart allograft rejection episodes.

Changes in intimal area, total vessel area, and lumen area were similar in segments with (n = 132) and segments without (n = 178) pre-existing donor disease. Despite overall shrinkage, change in total vessel area positively correlated with change in intimal area (r = 0.29, p < 0.0001). In large coronary segments, coronary artery shrinkage plays an important role in the loss of luminal diameter early after cardiac transplantation, whereas new intimal growth occurs in both large and small segments. Pre-existent donor disease does not aggravate these processes. Compensatory remodeling with increasing intimal growth retards the rate of lumen loss. As is intimal thickening, shrinkage and compensatory remodeling are important pathogenic mechanisms in transplant coronary artery disease.

Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is established as the optimal method for early detection of transplant vasculopathy. The association between cellular rejection and development of transplant vasculopathy remains controversial. This study attempts to determine the rate of progression of transplant vasculopathy lesions and its relationship with cellular rejection in a long-term (> 1 year) IVUS serial follow-up.A study cohort of 47 patients undergoing heart transplantation from 1993 to 1995 was evaluated. Intravascular ultrasound was performed at baseline (within 8 weeks) and annually for a period of 3 years to determine maximum intimal thickness and maximum plaque area in each coronary segment. Significant allograft vasculopathy was defined as a site with intimal thickness > 0.5 mm not present at baseline. Biopsy results were scored by assigning a numerical weight to each ISHLT grade during the first year. Donor lesions ranged from 0.86 to 1.1 mm, showing no evidence of progression at serial follow-up. De novo lesions were identified in 30 patients. These lesions appeared yearly but progressed slowly. The average biopsy score in the entire cohort was 1.1 +/- 0.8. Average biopsy score was > 1.0 in 35 patients with significant linear correlation between the rate of intimal progression and biopsy score (r = 0.42, p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only the biopsy score correlated with the rate of progression. Lesions of donor atherosclerosis do not change significantly after transplantation. However, de novo lesions continue to develop every year. In patients with evidence of rejection, the rate of progression of transplant vasculopathy correlates with the severity of rejection.

Dobutamine myocardial perfusion imaging is a useful method for evaluation of coronary artery disease. However, this technique does not allow for ischemia monitoring, which may have an impact on the safety of the test in heart transplant recipients due to cardiac sensory denervation. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of heart transplantation on the feasibility and complications of the dobutamine stress test. We studied 225 heart transplant recipients (mean age 57 +/- 7 years) and a control group of 225 patients without previous transplant matched for age and gender by dobutamine (up to 40 microg/kg per minute) stress myocardial perfusion imaging. During the test, transplant recipients had a lower prevalence of premature ventricular contractions (23% vs. 37%, p < 0.001) and ventricular tachycardia (0.04% vs 7.5%, p < 0.0001) compared with control patients. By multivariate analysis, heart transplantation was a powerful independent variable associated with a reduced risk of ventricular arrhythmias (chi(2) = 20.8, p < 0.0001) and minor side effects (nausea, dizziness, anxiety, flushing, chills) (chi(2) = 20, p < 0.0001) during dobutamine stress. The target heart rate was reached in 82% of transplant recipients and in 77% of the control group. Overall feasibility (achievement of the target heart rate and/or an ischemic end-point) was 87% in the transplant and 86% in the control group. Dobutamine stress myocardial perfusion imaging is a safe and feasible method for evaluation of coronary artery disease in heart transplant recipients. The prevalence of arrhythmias and minor complications using the dobutamine stress test is lower in heart transplant recipients compared with control patients. The independent association between heart transplantation and reduced risk of arrhythmias and minor side effects of the dobutamine stress test indicates that cardiac sensory and autonomic nerve function plays a major role in the induction of these complications during the test.

Because of the complexity of the trabeculated endocardial surface and tangential histologic sectioning, the differentiation of acute cellular rejection (ACR) from Quilty B lesions (QB) in endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) is problematic. We hypothesized that the phenotype chemokine RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) expression of infiltrating cells and the pattern of expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) may distinguish ACR from QB. In previous studies, the number of RANTES-positive cells and the expression of TGF-beta correlated with the severity of rejection. We used immunohistochemical techniques to stain sections of human EMBs with only QB (n = 14) or with only ACR (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Grades 1A and 1B, n = 7; Grades 3A and 3B, n = 7) for B (CD20) and T-lymphocytes (CD3), macrophages (CD68), RANTES, and TGF-beta expression. We graded the percentage of positive cells from 0 to 4 (1 = 1% to 25%; 2 = 26% to 50%; 3 = 51% to 75%, and 4 = 76% to 100%). When ACR was compared with QB, we found no difference in the proportion of myocardial B cells (0.9 +/- 0.3 vs 1.1 +/- 0.3, p = 0.17); however, we found a lesser proportion of T cells (1.8 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.8 +/- 0.9, p <0.01) but more macrophages (2.9 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.6, p < 0.0001) in ACR than in QB. We also found more RANTES-positive leukocytes in ACR vs. QB (2.8 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.9, p = 0.03). In QB, many endocardial vessels stained for TGF-beta (2.9 +/- 1.6). Myocardial vessels and injured myocytes in both ACR and QB expressed TGF-beta. In ACR, although T-lymphocytes are numerous, more than 50% of infiltrating cells are macrophages and more than 50% express RANTES. In QB lesions, more than 50% of infiltrating cells are T-lymphocytes and less that 50% of leukocytes will express RANTES. B cells are present in both ACR and QB, but on average comprise only 25% of the cells present. Thus, a relatively simple immunohistochemical analysis of endomyocardial biopsies may be useful in distinguishing ACR from QB.

Hypogammaglobulinemia (HGG) has been reported after solid organ transplantation and is noted to confer an increased risk of opportunistic infections. In this study, we sought to assess the relationship between severe HGG to infection and acute cellular rejection following heart transplantation. Between February 1997 and January 1999, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical outcome of 111 consecutive heart transplant recipients who had immunoglobulin G (IgG) level monitoring at 3 and 6 months post-transplant and when clinically indicated. Eighty-one percent of patients were males, mean age 54 +/- 13 years, and the mean follow-up period was 13.8 +/- 5.7 months. Patients had normal IgG levels prior to transplant (mean 1137 +/- 353 mg/dl). Ten percent (11 of 111) of patients developed severe HGG (IgG < 350 mg/dl) post-transplant. The average time to the lowest IgG level was 196 +/- 125 days. Patients with severe HGG were at increased risk of opportunistic infections compared to patients with IgG > 350 mg/dl (55% [6 of 11] vs. 5% [5 of 100], odds ratio = 22.8, p < 0.001). Compared to patients with no rejection, patients who experienced three or more episodes of rejection had lower mean IgG (580 +/- 309 vs. 751 +/- 325, p = 0.05), and increased incidence of severe HGG (33% [7 of 21] vs. 2.8% [1 of 35], p = 0.001). The incidence of rejection episodes per patient at 1 year was higher in patients with severe HGG compared to patients with IgG >350 (2.82 +/- 1.66 vs. 1.36 +/- 1.45 episodes/patient, p = 0.02). The use of parenteral steroid pulse therapy was associated with an increased risk of severe HGG (odds ratio = 15.28, p < 0.001). Severe HGG after cardiac transplantation may develop as a consequence of intensification of immunosuppressive therapy for rejection and hence, confers an increased risk of opportunistic infections. IgG level may be a useful marker for identifying patients at high risk. ", "label": 0}{"text": "Pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine in heart transplant recipients receiving metabolic inhibitors. Inhibitors of cyclosporine metabolism are commonly co-administered with cyclosporine in transplant recipients. The aim of this study was to compare cyclosporine pharmacokinetics using the conventional formulation (Sandimmune) and after switching to the microemulsion (Neoral) formulation, in stable heart transplant recipients receiving various cyclosporine metabolic inhibitors. Steady-state blood concentration-time profiles of Sandimmune were studied in 47 transplant recipients receiving either cyclosporine alone (Group A, n = 11) or in combination with diltiazem (120 mg/day, Group B, n = 11), ketoconazole (200 mg/day, Group C, n = 13), or both ketoconazole and diltiazem (200 and 120 mg/day, respectively, Group D, n = 12), and restudied 1 week after switching to Neoral. Neoral resulted in more rapid cyclosporine absorption as judged by the shorter absorption half-lives in all groups (p < 0.05). The mean percentage increase in the values of area-under-the-concentration-time curve was 42% and 37.5% higher for Neoral compared with Sandimmune for Groups A and B, respectively, but only 5.4% higher for Group C and 9.5% higher for Group D. The mean morning trough concentration of cyclosporine was not significantly different after administration of Neoral compared with Sandimmune in any of the groups studied (179 vs. 167 microg/liter for Group A; 171 vs. 147 microg/liter for Group B; 189 vs. 194 microg/liter for Group C; and 181 vs 201 microg/liter for Group D). Neoral did not alter serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, creatinine, and urea in any of the study groups. The faster absorption and improved bioavailability of cyclosporine (around 40%) with Neoral compared with Sandimmune was not seen in patients receiving ketoconazole, where in fact cyclosporine bioavailability was already maximal. Mean morning trough levels of cyclosporine did not reflect the improvement in bioavailability seen in patients switching from Sandimmune to Neoral. Cyclosporine dose adjustment may be needed when switching from Sandimmune to Neoral for patients not receiving sparing agents or who receive diltiazem, but trough levels cannot necessarily be relied upon to determine the degree of adjustment needed. For patientson ketoconazole, the absorption profile is already optimized and no dosage alteration seems necessary.

The alternative approach presented here would be to use biologically based biosensors for the direct measurement of physiological activity via functional integration of relevant governing inputs.

This retrospective review of organ donor records was designed to evaluate the practice of donor angiography in one organ procurement organization and determine the outcomes of angiography and its impact on the timing of the organ donation process. Concerns about transmission of atherosclerosis from donor to recipient have been heightened by the increasing prevalence of older donors. Guidelines that advocate the use of angiography in specific settings have been published, but no formal large-scale review has been performed. For the period January 1993 through June 1997, we reviewed all New England Organ Bank records of donors between the ages of 40 and 65 including any from whom at least one solid organ was procured. Data abstracted included the presence of risk factors, timing of the evaluation process and angiographic findings. Coronary angiography was performed in 119 donors aged 40 and older; 64.7% of these hearts were transplanted. Thirty-eight hearts were transplanted from donors not subjected to angiography and outcomes were poorer compared with donors who underwent angiography. Advanced donor age was the only significant predictor of coronary artery disease. The duration of the procurement process was not prolonged by the performance of angiography. Donor coronary angiography does not complicate the donation process. Older donor age is the most powerful predictor of coronary artery disease and may explain prior observations of poorer outcome with older donor hearts. These factors should be considered when angiography is performed as part of the heart donor evaluation.

Fractures due to osteoporosis are one of the major complications after heart transplantation, occurring mostly during the first 6 months after the graft, with an incidence ranging from 18% to 50% for vertebral fractures. Bone mineral density (BMD) decreases dramatically following the graft, at trabecular sites as well as cortical sites. This is explained by the relatively high doses of glucocorticoids used during the months following the graft, and by a long-term increase of bone turnover which is probably due to cyclosporine. There is some evidence for a beneficial effect on BMD of antiresorptive treatments after heart transplantation. The aim of this study was to assess prospectively the effect on BMD of a 3-year treatment of quarterly infusions of 60 mg of pamidronate, combined with 1 g calcium and 1000 U vitamin D per day, in osteoporotic heart transplant recipients, and that of a treatment with calcium and vitamin D in heart transplant recipients with no osteoporosis. BMD of the lumbar spine and the femoral neck was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in all patients every 6 months for 2 years and after 3 years. Seventeen patients, (1 woman, 16 men) aged 46+/-4 years (mean +/- SEM) received only calcium and vitamin D. A significant decrease in BMD was observed after 6 months following the graft, at the lumbar spine (- 6.6%) as well as at the femoral neck (-7.8%). After 2 years, BMD tended to recover at the lumbar spine, whereas the loss persisted after 3 years at the femoral neck. Eleven patients (1 woman and 10 men) aged 46+/-4 years (mean +/- SEM) started treatment with pamidronate on average 6 months after the graft, because they had osteoporosis of the lumbar spine and/or femoral neck (BMD T-score below -2.5 SD). Over the whole treatment period, a continuous increase in BMD at the lumbar spine was noticed, reaching 18.3% after 3 years (14.3% compared with the BMD at the time of the graft). BMD at the femoral neck was lowered in the first year by -3.4%, but recovered totally after 3 years of treatment. In conclusion, a 3-year study of treatment with pamidronate given every 3 months to patients with existing osteoporosis led to a significant increase in lumbar spine BMD and prevented loss at the femoral neck. However, since some of these patients were treated up to 14 months after the transplant, they may already have passed through the phase of most rapid bone loss. In patients who were not osteoporotic at baseline, treatment with calcium and vitamin D alone was not able to prevent the rapid bone loss that occurs immediately after transplantation.

In general, the newer techniques are at least as effective as the original technique with respect to arrhythmia, valvular function, hemodynamics, exercise capacity, and survival, but whether any one technique offers clear benefits over another has been controversial. The bicaval technique is most commonly used today, and the general consensus is that this technique ultimately will demonstrate clinical superiority.

An allograft is often considered an immunologically inert playing field on which host leukocytes assemble and wreak havoc. However, we demonstrate that graft-specific physiologic responses to early injury initiate and promulgate destruction of vascularized grafts. Serial analysis of allografts showed that intragraft expression of the three chemokine ligands for the CXC chemo-kine receptor CXCR3 was induced in the order of interferon (IFN)-gamma-inducible protein of 10 kD (IP-10, or CXCL10), IFN-inducible T cell alpha-chemoattractant (I-TAC; CXCL11), and then monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig, CXCL9). Initial IP-10 production was localized to endothelial cells, and only IP-10 was induced by isografting. Anti-IP-10 monoclonal antibodies prolonged allograft survival, but surprisingly, IP-10-deficient (IP-10(-/-)) mice acutely rejected allografts. However, though allografts from IP-10(+/+) mice were rejected by day 7, hearts from IP-10(-/-) mice survived long term. Compared with IP-10(+/+) donors, use of IP-10(-/-) donors reduced intragraft expression of cytokines, chemokines and their receptors, and associated leukocyte infiltration and graft injury. Hence, tissue-specific generation of a single chemokine in response to initial ischemia/reperfusion can initiate progressive graft infiltration and amplification of multiple effector pathways, and targeting of this proximal chemokine can prevent acute rejection. These data emphasize the pivotal role of donor-derived IP-10 in initiating alloresponses, with implications for tissue engineering to decrease immunogenicity, and demonstrate that chemokine redundancy may not be operative in vivo.

Three of the recipients required significant inotropic support for a few days postoperatively; however, all of the hearts functioned well over the intermediate and long term. Two recipients (1 from each group) died of complications other than heart failure (1.5 and 2 years postoperatively). Successful heart transplantation can be achieved using the hearts from patients succumbing to methanol or carbon monoxide poisoning.

Previously, we reported survival differences from the national heart transplant registry favoring centers that used intracellular organ preservation solutions. To eliminate center selection bias, we tested some of these solutions in a biventricular working rat heart model to determine their relative efficacy. Using 103 Sprague-Dawley rat hearts perfused with modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer, both ventricles functioned with adjustable independent preload and afterload and their pressure-length loops generated load-insensitive measurements of cardiac performance. After 15 minutes of stable function, each heart sustained 180 minutes of cold (4 degrees C) ischemia after a 5-minute perfusion by University of Missouri (UMC), Plegisol, Collins, University of Wisconsin, Custodiol, or Roe solutions. Eighty-two hearts were reperfused and the remainder were used for ATP analyses. Although the extracellular solution Plegisol showed good recovery of traditional hemodynamic values, including developed pressure and cardiac output, intracellular solutions like Roe had superior preservation of load-insensitive indices such as preload recruitable stroke work: Roe (intracellular) 103%+/-13%; Custodiol (intracellular) 96%+/-9%; UW (intracellular) 69%+/-12%; Collins (intracellular) 68%+/-9%; Plegisol (extracellular) 68%+/-7%; and University of Missouri (extracellular) 56%+/-10% (p = 0.04). Furthermore, recovery with intracellular solutions tended to be gradual but more progressive after ischemia in contrast to an early plateau shown by extracellular (p < 0.001). Right ventricular recovery and ATP measurements were similar between groups. These data support the superiority of certain intracellular preservation solutions and provide evidence that optimal heart organ protection may be difficult to judge clinically using hemodynamic values routinely available to the heart transplant surgeon.

The AC01 exhibited a distinct proliferative response to PDGF similar to that of AOSMC under serum-free conditions. 10 ng/ml of PDGF-BB increased by a factor of 4.5 and PDGF-AB doubled the thymidine uptake, but PDGF-AA caused only a slight increase. The proliferation was markedly inhibited by 10(-6) M of CsA but less affected by 10(-7) M.

The immunomodulator, FTY720, lowers the peripheral lymphocyte count (PLC) by inducing migration of circulating lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs. We investigated the efficacy of mono- vs. combined-FTY720/CsA therapy on graft survival (GS) and on lowering the PLC in a solid organ and a skin graft model, using strains with strong MHC disparity. Heterotopic cardiac or tail skin grafting was performed using the DA (RT1a) to Lewis (RT1(1)) rat strain combination. FTY720 was administered as a single daily dose by gavage alone or in combination with subcutaneously delivered CsA. PLC, body weight and drug concentrations were determined on day 7, 28, or the day of rejection. In placebo-treated animals the heart and skin allografts rejected after 6 and 8 days. FTY720 delayed rejection of both the solid organ and skin grafts. The maximal effect was achieved at 1 mg x kg(-l) x day(-1) FTY720, resulting in a median survival time (MST) of 14 days for both allotransplants comparable to the effect achieved by 1 mg x kg x day(-1) CsA in both models. In the cardiac graft experiment with CsA co-administration, doses of 0.3 and 1 mg/kg were used. Under these conditions very small doses of FTY720 were effective in maintaining grafts throughout the treatment period. Adding higher FTY720 doses to the 1 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) CsA was needed to effectively extend the skin GS, e.g. 0.3 mg x kg(-l) x day(-1) FTY720 prolonged GS from 13 to 47.5 days MST, i.e. well beyond the 28 day-treatment period. CsA did not influence the PLC at clinically relevant doses. FTY720 lowered the PLC significantly and dose-dependently, at doses lower than those needed for the prolongation of both cardiac and skin GS with FTY720 monotherapy. In rats with skin grafts the PLC was markedly lowered up to 1 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) FTY720, whereas, in the heart model, it was lowered up to 0.1 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1). Independently of the graft type, within the combination regimens 0.3 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) FTY720 achieved a maximal PLC depletion. Combining FTY720 and CsA was very well tolerated with respect to weight gain and lack of any clinically detectable infections. In the strain combination used FTY720 monotherapy was less effective than previously reported in maintaining grafts. The two-drug regimens extended strikingly the GS for both models. However, the prolongation of the heart GS was smoothly dose-related with FTY720 doses ranging from 0.01 to 1 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) , whereas, the skin graft prolongation was modest at doses up to 0.1 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) and remarkably enhanced at 0.3 and 1 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) FTY720.

One of the 6 patients died of intractable sepsis 17 days after the operation, but the other 5 were discharged with satisfactory hemodynamics. Immunosuppressive agents, including azathioprine, cyclosporin or FK-506, were given. One patient experienced moderate acute rejection, but it was controlled by FK-506, OKT-3 and solumedrol. However, another suffered from lymphoproliferative disease 8 months after transplant, but it was controlled by intravenous immunoglubulin, alpha-interferon and acyclovir.

In the other 31 patients with patent coronary arteries, there were 3 patients (10%) with abnormal DSE results, 19 patients (61%) with abnormal IBS patterns, and 16 patients (52%) with reversible thallium perfusion defects. Of the patients, 44% had cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and 56% interstitial fibrin deposition. There were significant differences in the prevalence of (201)thallium perfusion defects and serum cyclosporine levels between patients with and without abnormal IBS patterns. Pathologic changes were also associated with abnormal IBS patterns (p = 0.01). However, there was no association between abnormal IBS and DSE results. By multiple logistic regression analysis, the abnormal IBS patterns were associated inversely with serum cyclosporine level (p = 0.028). In conclusion, abnormal IBS patterns are associated significantly with perfusion heterogeneity and pathologic changes in heart transplant recipients without evident acute myocardial rejection. There is no association between abnormal IBS patterns and dobutamine-induced dyssynergy in these patients. IBS provides a noninvasive approach for detection of myocardial changes in transplanted hearts without evident acute rejection.

The objectives of this study were to perform bioelectrical impedance analysis before and after heart transplantation with comparison to healthy subjects. Eight patients (7 men, 1 woman) before (day 0) and after transplantation (day 3, 7, 12, 15, and 180) and 24 healthy controls, matched for sex, age, and body mass were studied. Data collection included bioelectrical impedance analysis (resistance, reactance, and estimates of body water), clinical, and laboratory measurements. Compared with controls, patients had at baseline significantly higher reactance, not significantly different resistance, body weight, total body water, and intra- to extracellular water ratio. After surgery, for reactance, there was an acute decrease followed by a slow, progressive increase up to normal level by day 15. Resistance and body weight did not significantly change; the intra- to extracellular water ratio significantly decreased with stable total body water. Changes in reactance are the main effects induced on bioelectrical impedance by heart transplantation. Acutely, there is a large decrease which likely reflects changes both in water distribution and in cell membrane function. The late changes more likely reflect the shift of body water from the extra- to the intracellular space with stable total body water.

Pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPS) antibody deficiency occurs in some children immunosuppressed following cardiac transplantation in early childhood. We studied lymphocyte subset populations in these children to identify patterns associated with antibody deficiency, particularly in CD21 + B cells. Lymphocyte surface markers CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, and CD21 were measured on whole blood by FACS analysis in four patient groups: cardiac transplant patients who did and did not respond to PPS, nontransplanted cardiac patients, and normal controls. Absolute cell numbers were compared with age-related normal ranges. The proportion of children with values below the age-related 25th percentile in each group was compared. Normal controls had significantly more CD3+, CD8+, and CD19+ cells, even when age-related differences were accounted for. Control groups had significantly more CD19 cells than transplant patients and transplanted PPS responders and cardiac controls had more mature B cells (CD21+) than transplanted PPS nonresponders. PPS antibody deficiency following pediatric cardiac transplantation may be related to an immaturity in B cells due to immunosuppression commenced in early childhood.

We previously have demonstrated impaired pneumococcal polysaccharide IgG antibody responses in children immunosuppressed following cardiac transplantation in early childhood. We have further characterized the antibody defect. To further investigate the production of antibody, antipneumococcal polysaccharide (PPS) specific IgM, IgG, IgG subclasses, and IgA were measured in postvaccination sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Two groups were studied: posttransplant children who made pneumococcal antibody in vivo following natural exposure or PPS immunization (R) and those with an impaired response (NR). There was no difference in IgM or IgA levels between R and NR. IgG and IgG2 levels were higher in R than NR (P = 0.002), even after adsorption of nonspecific common cell wall antigen antibody. Differences in anti-pneumococcal antibody levels suggest that immunoglobulin isotype switching from IgM to IgG and particularly IgG2 is impaired in patients immunosuppressed at a young age. These findings confirm data regarding the effect of immunosuppressive agents derived from animal models in humans.

To determine the late effectiveness of partial left ventriculectomy and risk factors for failure. Between May 1996 and December 1998, partial left ventriculectomy and concomitant mitral valve surgery were performed in 62 patients (95% transplant candidates) with a mean age of 54 years (range 17-72 years). All patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III (38%) or IV (62%) because of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (59 patients) or ischemic, valvular, or familial cardiomyopathy (1 patient each). Outcomes considered for multivariable analysis included implantation of left ventricular assist device, return to class IV heart failure, relisting for transplantation, and death. Partial left ventriculectomy reduced the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter immediately preoperatively to immediately postoperatively (from 8.4 +/- 1.1 cm to 5.92 +/- 0.8 cm; P =.01), reduced the left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (from 133 +/- 48.6 mL to 64.1 +/- 26 mL; P <.0001), and increased the left ventricular ejection fraction (from 16 +/- 7.6 to 31.5 +/- 10.9; P <.0001). Survival was 80% and 60% at 1 and 3 years after surgery and freedom from failure was 49% and 26%, respectively. Increased systolic pulmonary artery pressure, decreased maximum exercise oxygen consumption, and increased left atrial pressure were associated with failure and/or death. The degree of preoperative mitral regurgitation did not correlate with clinical outcome. Early and late failures preclude the widespread use of partial left ventriculectomy. However, in view of its sometimes beneficial effect, use in situations that do not allow for transplantation or as a biologic bridge to transplantation may be appropriate.

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is emerging as an effective agent for the treatment of both established rejection and primary rejection prophylaxis in solid-organ transplantation (Tx). However, little data is available on the use of MMF in the pediatric population. We therefore report on our experience with MMF in 21 pediatric heart transplant recipients. Data were obtained by retrospective chart review. Median age at time of review was 12.3 yr (range 11 months to 16.9 yr). Median age at Tx was 10.7 yr (range 55 days to 16.7 yr). MMF was started at a median of 4.3 months after Tx (range 1 day to 4.5 yr). At the time of MMF institution, all patients were concurrently on prednisone and azathioprine; 20 of these patients were also undergoing treatment with tacrolimus (median dose 0.18 mg/kg, range 0.03-0.64 mg/kg) and one with cyclo-sporin A (10 mg/kg). Azathioprine was discontinued at the time of commencing MMF. The average MMF dose was 40 +/- 14 mg/kg. The rationale for switching to MMF included rejection (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [ISHLT] 3A/B), 66%; inability to wean steroids, 14%; ABO blood group donor-recipient mismatch, 10%; coronary artery disease (CAD), 5%; and side-effects of immuno-suppression, 5%. Of the patients switched for rejection, 93% demonstrated resolved or improving rejection. Both ABO donor-recipient mismatch patients were started on tacrolimus/MMF as primary therapy and had no significant episodes of rejection. Two patients had rejection classified as unchanged (one with CAD, one treated with addition of sirolimus prior to improvement). Corticosteroids were successfully discontinued in 28% of patients, and 20% are currently on a reduced dose. Fourteen per cent developed significant rejection while attempting to reduce the steroid dose. Steroid reduction has not yet been attempted in 38% of patients. The following side-effects were reported in 38% of the patients: diarrhea, 10%; gastrointestinal discomfort, 20%; and leukopenia, 20%. Dose reduction or temporary discontinuation was required in 63% of the patients who experienced side-effects (24% of the total number of patients). Opportunistic infections developed in 10% (cryptococcus, cytomegalovirus). Hence, MMF appears to be effective for treatment of rejection in the pediatric heart transplant population and has an acceptable side-effect profile. In addition, it may have a role in primary rejection prophylaxis and may facilitate a reduced steroid dosage or a steroid-free immunosuppression regimen.

To define the incidence, course, and etiology of hematologic abnormalities in children on tacrolimus-based immunosuppression, we reviewed records of 106 transplant patients (70 heart, 16 heart and lung, 20 double lung), 0-21 yr of age, who were transplanted at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh from 1989 to 1997. Fifty-four of the 106 patients (51%) developed 65 abnormal hematologic episodes (32 anemia, nine neutropenia, nine thrombocytopenia, 15 simultaneous anemia and neutropenia with or without thrombocytopenia). Common etiologies included: infections, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, and medications. Eleven episodes (seven anemia, one neutropenia, and three simultaneous anemia and neutropenia) had unclear etiologies and process of elimination suggested an association with tacrolimus. Interventions included filgrastim (effective in 15 of 15 patients, with resolution of neutropenia in a median of 5 days) and epoetin alfa (effective in five of 16 patients, including four of four patients with anemia possibly related to tacrolimus). Five patients (two with neutropenia and three with simultaneous neutropenia and anemia) were switched to cyclosporin A (CsA); rapid resolution occurred in four of the five patients, suggesting a possible association of the hematologic abnormalities with tacrolimus. In summary, hematologic abnormalities are common in children on tacrolimus-based immunosuppression. Most of these hematologic abnormalities are caused by common etiologies; however, a sub-population exists where tacrolimus may be the etiologic agent. Anemia and neutropenia respond to treatment with epoetin alfa and filgrastim. After thorough investigation, a trial switch to CsA may be warranted.

However, it is unclear how an appropriately sized porcine donor will be selected for a particular human recipient.

We also obtained direct ex vivo measurements of swine heart weight and linear dimensions (n = 71). Relationships between a swine's height, weight, length, chest circumference and these internal and external cardiac dimensions are described. The strongest correlations were found between a pig's body length and its aortic annulus and root diameters (r-values = 0.97). These relationships are accurately described by univariate linear regression models. By cross-relating our morphometric measurements of aortic annulus diameter in the miniature swine with normative human data, we were able to develop a nomogram, relating swine length and human height, which predicts which miniature swine would donate the best size-matched heart for a particular human recipient.

Successful transplantation of allogeneic organs is an important objective in modern medicine. However, sophisticated immune defense mechanisms, primarily evolved to combat infections, often work against medical transplantation. To investigate the roles of natural and adaptive immune responses in transplant rejection, we functionally inactivated key effector systems of the innate (NK cells) and the adaptive immune system (CD28-mediated costimulation of T cells) in mice. Neither of these interventions alone led to acceptance of allogeneic vascularized cardiac grafts. In contrast, inhibition of NK-receptor-bearing cells combined with CD28-costimulation blockade established long-term graft acceptance. These results indicate a concerted interplay between innate and adaptive immune surveillance for graft rejection. Thus we suggest that inactivation of NK-receptor-bearing cells could be a new strategy for successful survival of solid-organ transplants.

Although alloantibodies have been correlated with decreased graft survival, the mechanisms of alloantibody-mediated injury remain largely undefined in vivo. In the present study, we have established a model of alloantibody-mediated graft injury using B10.A (H-2a) hearts transplanted to wild type (WT) or immunoglobulin knock out (IgKO) C57BL-Igh-6 (H-2b) mice. Alloantibodies were measured in the circulation and graft by flow cytometry and in immunofluorescence staining, respectively. Intragraft cytokine mRNA expression was evaluated using a competitive template reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. P-selectin and von Willebrand factor expression were localized by immunoperoxidase staining. The capacity of alloantibodies to restore acute cardiac allograft rejection was tested by passive transfer of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against donor major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens to IgKO recipients. B10.A cardiac allografts are rejected acutely by WT C57BL/6 recipients, but over 50% of the cardiac allografts survived more than 50 days after transplantation in IgKO mice. Competitive template RT-PCR on the cardiac transplants demonstrated similar levels of IL-1-alpha, IL-12 (p40), TNF-alpha, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-10 mRNA in WT and IgKO recipients 8-10 days after transplantation, indicating that macrophage- and T-cell-dependent immune responses were intact in IgKO recipients. The rejection of B10.A hearts in WT recipients was characterized by interstitial and perivascular cellular infiltration; IgG, IgM, and complement (C3) deposition; vascular cell injury and intravascular platelet aggregation; and release of von Willebrand factor and P-selectin. In IgKO recipients the lower degree of vascular injury in the absence of alloantibody responses was reflected by the lack of release of von Willebrand factor and P-selectin, which remained confined to cytoplasmic storage granules of endothelial cells and platelets. Acute rejection of cardiac allografts was restored to IgKO recipients by passive transfer of proinflammatory IgG2b mAbs against donor MHC; recipients injected with isotype-matched control mAbs did not reject. In contrast, passive transfer of IgG1 mAbs against donor MHC failed to restore acute rejection of cardiac allografts to IgKO recipients. Passive transfer of IgG2b, but not IgG1 mAbs was associated with endothelial cell activation and plate. let aggregation together with the release of preformed von Willebrand factor and P-selectin from storage granules. Acute rejection of cardiac allografts can be reconstituted in IgKO recipients by passive transfer of IgG2b, but not IgG1 antibody.

Along with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), the beta-adrenergic receptor blockers have gradually emerged to be standard in the therapy of heart failure. Individual beta-blockers that have been shown to reduce all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure include bisoprolol, metoprolol and carvedilol. Carvedilol distinguishes from the other beta-blockers as being a non-selective beta(1)- and beta(2)-receptor blocker with (1)-receptor blockade effect and anti-oxidant properties. The drug does not have sympathomimetic activity and has vasodilatory effects attributable to its (1)-receptor blockade property. Experimental and clinical studies have confirmed carvedilol's vasodilator, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic properties, which may contribute to its effect in reversing cardiac remodelling in animal models and patients with heart failure. These pharmacological properties render carvedilol a potentially useful agent in the treatment of patients with heart failure. Early studies of carvedilol in heart failure have reported beneficial haemodynamic effects but variable effects on exercise tolerance and clinical well being. The large-scale US Carvedilol Heart Failure Program and the Australian/New Zealand Heart Failure Collaborative Research Group reported beneficial effects of carvedilol on mortality, morbidity and clinical well being in patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure. The recently reported but yet unpublished preliminary results of the COPERNICUS study suggest that carvedilol improves mortality and morbidity in patients with advanced heart failure and severe symptoms. At this time, it is unclear whether the ancillary pharmacological properties of carvedilol can be translated to more superior clinical benefit compared to the other beta-blockers. Preliminary studies examining surrogate end points suggest that carvedilol may improve left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) more than metoprolol. More conclusive information regarding their relative effects of clinical outcomes will await the completion of the COMET study, which compares the effect of metoprolol and carvedilol on mortality and morbidity, expected at the end of the year 2002.

There was antero-lateral-apical akinesia and a ventricular septal defect (VSD) with a left-right shunt (Qp/Qs = 1.54).

The purpose of this retrospective study is to review our experience with tacrolimus as a rescue immunosuppressant for heart transplant recipients with refractory rejection or cyclosporine intolerance. From June 1995 to November 1998, 15 cardiac transplant recipients were converted from our standard cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive regimen to a tacrolimus-based treatment. Each patient had been treated with cyclosporine, azathioprine and steroids. Six were switched to tacrolimus for persistent rejection, four for recurrent acute rejection and five for severe debilitating side-effects attributed to cyclosporine. All ten patients converted to tacrolimus because of rejection had been treated with high-dose methylprednisolone intravenously and four had also received anti-lymphocyte globulin (ALG; one patient) or anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG; three patients) preparations. The time between transplantation and conversion to tacrolimus ranged from 44 to 1866 (median, 380) days. The range of follow-up after conversion was 84-1379 (median, 806) days. Eleven patients are alive with a follow-up period of 764+/-435 (median, 820) days. Four patients died between 90 and 930 (median, 464) days after conversion. The average number of episodes of acute rejection/recipient decreased from 2.1+/-1.6 on the cyclosporine regimen to 0.2+/-0.4 on the tacrolimus regimen (P<0.001).

The cancer frequencies were: solid tumors, 55%; non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), 20%; Kaposi's sarcomas, 11%; skin cancers, 9%; undifferentiated sarcomas and myelomas, 5%. Solid tumors mainly affected the lung (39%), bowel (16%), stomach (6.5%), liver (6.5%), pancreas (6.5%) and oral cavity (6.5%).

As determined by univariate and multivariate analyses, sex, number of treated rejections, previous history of tumor, average dose of cyclosporine and prednisone and cyclosporine blood levels did not increase the incidence of malignancies. Univariate analysis suggests a significant correlation between the type of prophylactic immunoglobulins and the average dose of azathioprine with the incidence of neoplasms. Both univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated a significant correlation between patient's age at the time of transplantation and risk of cancer occurrence (risk increased by 1.074/year; P=0.0056 with multivariate Cox regression). Cancer is a strong limitation for long-term survival after heart transplantation. The only risk factor recognized is the patient's age at the time of transplant.

In the first experiment, a dose response study, an adenoviral vector encoding the beta-galactosidase gene was infused into the donor heart with the pulmonary artery open and flushed out prior to performing the transplant. In the second experiment, the effects of clamping the pulmonary artery during vector infusion and not flushing out the viral solution, resulting in vector dwell during the warm ischemia, were examined. In the first experiment, gene transfer was relatively inefficient; however, transgene expression improved with increases in the vector dose (range, 1x10(7)-1x10(9)). The efficiency of gene transfer was significantly greater when the conditions of the second experiment were applied. In all models studied, cardiomyocytes and not vascular endothelial cells were the predominant cell type transduced. This study indicates that the conditions of adenoviral vector delivery are critical for optimizing gene transfer in the transplant setting. In addition, intravascular administration of adenoviral vector to the donor heart results predominantly in cardiomyocyte transgene expression.

Therefore, we evaluated intragraft cytokine mRNA expression at an early stage after clinical heart transplantation and related these data to ischemia, immunosuppression, and rejection. We sampled endomyocardial biopsies at 30 minutes (EMB 0) and at 1 week (EMB 1) after transplantation from 20 cardiac allograft recipients. Intragraft monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) mRNA expression levels were quantitatively measured using competitive template Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We measured significantly lower MCP-1 and bFGF mRNA expression levels in EMB 1 compared with EMB 0 (MCP-1, p = 0.006; bFGF, p = 0.019). We found no direct correlation between the cytokine mRNA expression levels in EMB 0 or EMB 1 and ischemic times, induction therapy, or cyclosporine whole-blood trough levels. Patients with a high incidence of acute rejection episodes (>2 in the first year) had higher bFGF mRNA expression levels (p = 0.009) and comparable MCP-1 mRNA expression levels (p = 0.378) at 1 week, compared with patients with a lower rejection incidence. The MCP-1 and bFGF mRNA expression levels in the first week were not associated with the development of graft vascular disease in the first year post-transplant. We found a significant decrease of intragraft MCP-1 and bFGF mRNA expression levels in the first post-operative week. Patients with a high incidence of acute rejection had higher bFGF mRNA expression levels in their first week biopsy. Therefore, we conclude that patients who fail to down-regulate their bFGF mRNA expression early after transplantation are at higher risk for acute rejection.

In addition, lymphocytic cellular infiltration of myocarditis due to rejection or reactivation was immunophenotyped in the biopsies of both groups with rejection grades 3 to 4, in biopsies with signs of reactivation, and in fragments of the receptor heart with chronic C myocarditis. A search for Trypanosoma cruzi was performed in all biopsies in the C group in which lymphocyte immunophenotyping was done. We used immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. The Quilty effect was present in 23% of the biopsies, involving 69.7% of the patients without a significant difference between groups (p = 0.509). Rejection was frequently observed in biopsies with the Quilty effect and the effect often recurred in the same patient. Rejection grades 3 to 4 was more frequent in the C group (p = 0.023). There were 5 episodes of Chagas' disease reactivation with myocarditis in 2 cases. The mean numbers of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, and the CD4+-to-CD8+ ratio were similar for rejection in both groups (p > 0.05), while the CD4+-to-CD8+ ratio was significantly lower in chronic C myocarditis compared to rejection in the C group (p = 0.043). There was no significant difference in ischemic damage or interstitial fibrosis in the groups but there was a higher frequency of hypertrophy in the NC group (p = 0.007). The histopathological features of heart transplantation in C patients did not differ from that in NC patients in regard to the Quilty effect, development of myocardial fibrosis and ischemia. However, the higher involvement of the C group for rejection grades 3 to 4 suggested higher susceptibility to this event. The similarity of the lymphocytic cellular composition for rejection in both groups indicates that C patients respond to immunological stimulus in a similar pattern as NC patients.

Endothelial injury from preservation solutions has been implicated in acute coronary vasospasm and pathologic activation of the endothelium, which can contribute to the development of graft coronary vasculopathy after heart transplantation. Preservation solutions with a powerful antioxidant capacity may decrease the occurrence of these complications. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of Celsior (an anti-oxidant solution specifically designed for cardiac preservation) in a model of heart preservation (4 hours at 4 degrees C to reproduce the situation encountered in clinical heart transplantation) compared two commonly used cardioplegic and preservation strategies on coronary endothelial function. Endothelium-dependent relaxation of normal porcine epicardial coronary arteries to serotonin (5-HT, an agonist that activates 5-HT(1d) receptors coupled to Gi proteins) and bradykinin (BK, which activates B2 receptors coupled to Gq proteins) was studied in standard organ chamber experiments in the following groups: a control group was submitted to immediate excision without cardioplegia and preserved in saline solution (0.9% NaCl) for 4 hours (Group 1); two groups had cardioplegia induced with a crystalloid solution and were stored for 4 hours in saline (Group 2) or 4 hours in Celsior solution (Group 3); and two groups had cardioplegia induced with normothermic blood cardioplegia and were stored for 4 hours in the saline (Group 4), or 4 hours in Celsior solution (Group 5). Finally, two groups underwent cardioplegia with Celsior and were stored for 4 hours in saline (Group 6), or 4 hours in the Celsior solution (Group 7). All cardioplegia solutions were at 4 degrees C (except blood cardioplegia at 37 degrees C) and all preservations solutions were at 4 degrees C. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to serotonin were significantly decreased in all groups except the Celsior + Celsior group compared with the control group. There were no significant differences in relaxation to bradykinin except in one group. Use of the Celsior solution for induction of cardioplegia and storage better preserved endothelium-dependent G-protein-mediated relaxation compared with the other arrest and preservation strategies. The observed effect may be associated with an improvement in both short- and long-term outcome in heart transplantation, especially because these alterations may be further compounded by reperfusion.

Limitations of the isolated perfused rat heart model for heart preservation studies include short study time due to the lack of stability of the preparation. We aimed to develop a new experimental model based on heterotopic heart transplantation in the rat to achieve simultaneous (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and functional study of the transplanted heart during early and late blood reperfusion. Twenty-five Lewis rats underwent heterotopic abdominal isograft heart transplantation and were randomized in two groups. Hearts were harvested after cardioplegic arrest induced with Centre de R\u00e9sonance Magn\u00e9tique Biologique et M\u00e9dicale (CRMBM) solution and then stored at 4 degrees C for a total ischemic time of 3 hours. Graft contractility measurement and simultaneous (31)P MRS were performed after 1 hour and 24 hours of blood reperfusion, respectively, in groups I (n = 12) and II (n =13). Contractility improved during reperfusion. The mean rate pressure product plus or minus standard error of mean increased from 11,373 +/- 1,377 mm Hg/min in group I to 24,363 +/- 3,860 mm Hg/min in group II (P = 0.003), while mean dP/dtmax increased from 1,642 +/- 173 mm Hg/sec to 2,571 +/- 333 mm Hg/sec, respectively (p = 0.03). Simultaneously, both the phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and inorganic phosphate/ATP ratios decreased from group I to group II (p = 0.025 and p = 0.015, respectively), suggesting regeneration of the intracellular pool of ATP in group II. Simultaneous functional and metabolic studies of the transplanted heart are feasible in rats. Improvement in contractility during late reperfusion is contemporary with significant changes in energetic metabolism. Our model should be useful for the further improvement of heart preservation, which may result in significant clinical progress.

Proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), play important roles in acute allograft rejection. FR167653 is an inhibitor of these cytokines that acts through inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 pathway. We examined the effect of FR167653 on allograft rejection. We used Brown-Norway and Lewis rats as donors and recipients, respectively. We performed heterotopic cardiac transplantation. The control group consisted of untreated rats. In the experimental groups, recipients were intraperitoneally injected with FR167653 just after operation, followed by daily injection of the drug from Day 1 to 10. We divided 20 rats into 5 groups, which received varying doses of FR167653, ranging from 75 to 300 mg/kg/day. In the control group, the mean graft survival was 6.8 +/- 0.3 days. FR167653 at 150 mg/kg/day significantly prolonged the survival period (up to 12.1 +/- 1.5 days, p = 0.002). Histologically, FR167653 markedly suppressed cellular infiltration on Day 5 post-transplantation. The serum level of TNF-alpha in the control group was persistently elevated from 9.3 +/- 3.9 pg/ml to 11.3 +/- 3.8 pg/ml, whereas FR167653 significantly suppressed the level to <1.4 +/- 1.4 pg/ml.

In this study, we used a heterotopic abdominal heart transplant model in monkeys to evaluate the roles of these molecules in graft coronary vasculopathy. We demonstrated that Egr-1 and BTEB2 are induced in vascular SMCs of rejected cardiac allografts well before morphologic changes, such as intimal thickening. These findings suggest that expression of Egr-1 and BTEB2 is one of the initial events in allograft angiopathy.

CTLA4Ig strongly adheres to B7 molecules on antigen-presenting cells to block intracellular signal transduction via CD28 on helper T cells, which eventually inhibits immune responses. We have demonstrated that the administration to recipient animals of adenoviral vectors containing CTLA4Ig gene (adCTLA4Ig) prolonged graft survival, although the gene expression diminished in a time-dependent manner and the grafts were finally rejected. In addition, recipient animals treated with FTY720, a new immunosuppressant, exhibited a decrease in the number of peripheral lymphocytes due to apoptosis. In this study, we performed adCTLA4Ig transfection combined with FTY720 treatment in heart-grafted rats to determine if the combination could induce a mutual effect on graft survival. The recipient animals were given injections of 1 x 10(9) plaque-forming units of adCTLA4Ig via the tail vein immediately after grafting. On the day before transplantation we administered FTY720 orally to some of these animals at a dosage of 5 mg/kg and again on the day of transplantation. The median graft survival period in the adCTLA4Ig-only group was 27 days, whereas that in the combination group was markedly prolonged to 56 days. Of 15 grafts, 5 survived indefinitely. In these groups we observed detectable levels of CTLA4Ig in the sera 49 days after grafting; the levels were always higher in the combination group than in the adCTLA4Ig-only group. As a result, this study revealed that FTY720 and adCTLA4Ig have a potent mutual effect on graft survival during rat heart transplantation. Furthermore, it is highly possible that FTY720 enhances gene expression of adCTLA4Ig, which may be related to the long-term acceptance of grafts.

Acute allograft rejection is one of the main causes of early death after transplantation. The cellular rejection is characterized by cellular infiltrates with or without myocyte necrosis. However, some patients develop left ventricular dysfunction due to rejection without evidence of cellular infiltration. In these patients, the rejection is mediated by antibodies and complement. Humoral rejection is a relative rare but potentially fatal form of acute allograft rejection. We report two patients with left ventricular dysfunction secondary to humoral rejection, shortly after cardiac transplantation. Both patients were treated with methylprednisolone, and azathioprine was substituted by cyclophosphamide. One patient underwent plasmapheresis. The clinical outcome was satisfactory and the left ventricular function returned to normal in both cases.

The Rel/NF-kappaB transcription factor pathway, regulated by IkappaB proteins, is considered central to immune responses, although there are surprisingly few in vivo data concerning alloresponses. We undertook analysis of NF-kappaB and IkappaB mRNA intracardiac allograft expression, and NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, during acute rejection versus CD154 monoclonal antibody (mAb)-induced tolerance induction in fully MHC-disparate mice. Intragraft expression of all nine NF-kappaB and IkappaB genes increased during development of rejection, and nuclear translocation of p50, p52, and p65 was detected. CD154 mAb therapy decreased mRNA levels of all nine NF-kappaB and IkappaB genes, and impaired nuclear translocation of p50, p52, and p65 NF-kappaB proteins. However, prolonged survival could not be induced by CD154 mAb in p50- or p52-deficient allograft recipients, indicating an absolute requirement for expression of these genes in CD154 mAb-induced tolerance. We conclude that, whereas blanket approaches to NF-kappaB suppression are unlikely to be effective strategies for tolerance induction, a better understanding of the roles of individual NF-kappaB and IkappaB genes may allow development of more precise and effective therapies.

In this study, we investigated whether antivimentin antibodies are associated with TxCAD and whether their presence can be used to identify patients at high risk of developing angiographically detectable TxCAD. Up to 5 years after transplantation, 880 sequential sera (7.07+/-1.8 samples/patient) were collected retrospectively from 109 patients; the majority were collected in the first 2 years. Sera were assessed for antivimentin antibodies using ELISA. TxCAD was assessed by annual angiography. Mean titres of antivimentin antibodies, calculated up to 1, 2, and 5 years, were significantly higher in patients who developed TxCAD than those who remained disease free (P<0.0001, P<0.0038, and P<0.0001, respectively). A predictive test based on the first-year mean vimentin titre alone (> or = 120) produced a test with 63% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Inclusion of persistent rejection or high 1-year mean titre (> or = 270) as a risk factor produced a test with 66% sensitivity and 82% specificity. Multivariate analysis of time to occurrence of transplant vasculopathy showed that mean titre at 1 or 2 years was an independent predictor of time until disease in the presence of all other variables.

Male AO recipient rats were intrathymically inoculated with 2.5x10(7) PVG splenocytes immediately followed by heterotopic transplantation of a PVG cardiac allograft (day 0).

Infiltrate analysis displayed massive parenchymatous infiltrates (CD8+ cells and ED1+ macrophages) 2 weeks after transplantation. At later time points, infiltrates became epicardial and/or blood vessel associated and mainly consisted of CD4+, CD8+, and B cells. Mixed lymphocyte reactions showed nonspecifically decreased responses at 60 days but complete restoration of these responses at later time points (120 to 280 days). Intragraft cytokine mRNA expression showed decreased interleukin-2/interferon-gamma and sustained interleukin-10 expression 2 weeks after transplantation.

Twenty-two consecutive transplant candidates were psychically evaluated as part of the preoperative protocol. In the waiting period, 1 and 6 months after OHT, they were asked to fill out the following questionnaires: the General Health Questionnaire, the Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Perceived Social Support Scale, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale and the Personal Reaction Inventory. A DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis was found in nine patients (41%); four patients (18%) presented with an Axis II diagnosis. One month after OHT, scores of depression, anxiety and general health significantly improved, while scores of social support, alexithymia and social desirability did not differ. In the sixth postoperative month, all psychological scores remained stable. A high prevalence of preoperative psychopathology was reported in 22 candidates who received OHT. Surgical intervention obviously improved the quality of life after cardiac transplantation.

HR recovery at 1, 3, 5, and 8 minutes also differed significantly within the groups (normal and CAD) based on the use of beta blockers. There was highly significant correlation between decrease in HR and peak HR, percent peak HR and HR reserve percent in normal and CAD groups. After correction of the HR recovery for dependence on peak HR and HR reserve percent, the difference in HR recovery between normal and CAD groups was markedly reduced. The difference in the decrease of HR within each group (normal and CAD), based on the use of beta blockers or not, was also markedly reduced. beta blockers have a significant impact on the decrease in HR due to its effect on chronotropism. HR recovery rate is highly dependent on the chronotropic response. Hence, the main portion of the abnormality in HR recovery after exercise can be explained by chronotropic incompetence.

Possible roles of dendritic cells (DCs) in allogeneic immune responses in host lymphoid tissues were characterized in situ by using rat DC transfer and cardiac transplantation models. When allogeneic DCs were intravenously injected, these cells selectively migrated to the T-cell area of hepatic lymph nodes, with peak accumulation at 18 h after injection. Donor DCs and proliferating host T cells formed clusters (rosettes) in which the T-cell proliferative response started. The donor DCs were CD80(+) CD86(+) and, ultrastructurally, were in intimate contact with lymphoblasts within the rosettes. As a novel finding, some of the migrated donor DCs were quickly phagocytosed by putative host interdigitating DCS: By 48 h, the remaining donor DCs had disintegrated within the rosettes. Host interdigitating DCs also formed rosettes throughout the T-cell area, and their kinetics correlated well with that of the T-cell proliferation. In the cardiac allograft model, a few donor DCs selectively migrated to the host spleen and hepatic nodes. Rosette formation by donor and host DCs, phagocytosis of donor DCs, and the T-cell proliferative response occurred in much the same fashion as they did in the first experiment.

The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) after reperfusion correlated with myocardial ATP (r = -0.65, n = 25, P = 0.003) and Ca concentrations (r = -0.68, n = 25, P = 0005). However, the parameter indicating LV elasticity (max LV -dp/dt) correlated with neither the Ca or ATP concentration following reperfusion. NDS prevented stiffness (increased LVEDP) better than HTK during normethermic cardioplegia for 30 min. These results in vitro suggest that NDS prevents myocardial Ca accumulation, depletion of ATP and cAMP, and preserves LV diastolic function, particularly stiffness after reperfusion, for up to 12 h. Furthermore, the myocardial Ca concentration is inversely correlated with the cAMP and cGMP concentrations.

In clinical organ transplantation monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to different surface molecules of immunocompetent cells become integral parts of the immunosuppressive therapy. In this study, a mAb against the rat leukocyte common antigen CD45 (RT7) was tested for its immunosuppressive potency after a single perioperative injection. Binding and depleting properties of the anti-RT7 mAb were investigated by flow cytometry. In the fully major histocompatibility complex-disparate heart and skin transplantation models (LEW [RT1l]--> LEW.1W [RT1u]), a single dose of anti-RT7 mAb (10 mg/kg) was administered intravenously (day -1). To characterize the long-term acceptance of heart allografts second set skin transplantation (day 100), mixed lymphocyte reaction studies (day 100) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis for intragraft cytokine expression (day 200) were performed. The anti-RT7 mAb bound to nearly all hematopoietic lineage cells, but particularly T and NK cells, and profoundly depleted these cells in circulation and lymphoid tissues. Anti-RT7 mAb-treated rats showed long-term acceptance of heart allografts (>200 days; n=12), whereas untreated recipients rejected allografts by day 8 (n=6). In contrast to hearts, primary skin allograft survival was only moderately prolonged. Animals with stable heart allograft acceptance showed normal in vitro lymphocyte proliferation responses to donor and third party antigen. These recipients also acutely rejected second set donor-strain skin grafts without inducing rejection of persisting heart allografts. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of intragraft cytokines showed up-regulation of Fas-ligand and IL-4 mRNA in long-surviving heart allografts. The findings demonstrate that a single injection of an anti-RT7 mAb in the rat can induce stable long-term acceptance of heart allografts by transient but profound T-cell depletion. Local immunoregulatory mechanisms seem to play a role for maintenance of long-term graft acceptance. ", "label": 0}{"text": "Apoptosis in chronic rejection of human cardiac allografts. We investigated the role of apoptosis (programed cell death) in the pathogenesis of chronic rejection. Epicardial coronary arteries from cardiac allografts with chronic rejection were examined for apoptosis by the TUNEL assay. Double labeling was carried out using anti-CD3, anti-CD68, and anti-von Willenbrand factor (vWF) monoclonal antibodies. Additional immunostaining was carried using anti-Fas, anti-Fas-L, and anti-Bcl-2 monoclonal antibodies. Apoptosis-associated oligonucleosomal DNA degradation was assessed by DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. The transcription level of apoptosis-related caspase genes were determined using microarrays. Apoptotic cells (TUNEL+) were detected within the arterial wall and in perivascular areas. Double labeling demonstrated that apoptotic cells included T cells (CD3+), monocyte/macrophages (CD68+), and vascular endothelial cells (VWF+). Numbers and densities of TUNEL+ cells did not correlate with the degree of arterial stenosis. Apoptosis-associated oligonucleosomal DNA degradation was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA, which showed DNA fragments of approximately 180 bp and multimers thereof (DNA laddering gel), which are characteristic for DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells. Microarray analysis demonstrated that the apoptosis related caspases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, were all transcribed (caspases 8, 9, and 10 were highly up-regulated). These results are consistent with the involvement of apoptosis in chronic rejection. Immunoreactivity for Fas/Fas-L was present at the sites of apoptotic cells. Immunoreactivity for Bcl-2 was present in areas with very few apoptotic cells. Apoptotic cells include T cells, monocyte/macrophages, and endothelial cells. Apoptosis, likely through the Fas/Fas-L system, is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic rejection in cardiac allografts.

Chronic rejection, or cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), remains the leading cause of late death in heart transplant recipients. The precise role and contributions of T lymphocyte subsets to CAV development remains unknown. Donor hearts from B6.C-H2bm12 mice were transplanted into T lymphocyte subset knockout recipients and T lymphocyte-reconstituted nude recipients. No immunosuppression was used. Intimal proliferation was measured morphometrically. In vitro studies were performed to analyze the donor-specific activation status of recipient CD8+ lymphocytes by examining cellular proliferation, interleukin-2 secretion, and interleukin-2Ralpha expression. Intracellular cytokine staining assay was performed to determine both the profile and source of intragraft cytokines. Hearts transplanted into wild-type recipients developed severe CAV by 24 days. Intimal lesions were absent in the hearts that were transplanted into nude and CD4-/- knockout mice (containing CD8+ lymphocytes). In contrast, the donor hearts in CD8-/- knockout recipients (containing CD4+ lymphocytes) developed CAV, but significantly less than in wildtype. Adoptive transfer of T lymphocyte subset populations into nude recipients confirmed that CAV was absolutely contingent on CD4+ lymphocytes, and that CD8+ lymphocytes played an additive role in intimal lesion progression in the presence of CD4+ lymphocytes. Although CD8+ lymphocytes alone did not cause CAV in vivo, we demonstrated that MHC class II disparate alloantigens activated CD8+ lymphocytes both in vivo and in vitro. Finally, both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes contributed to the intragraft IL-2 and IFN-gamma production. In this MHC class II mismatched murine model, CAV is a T lymphocyte dependent event, and absolutely contingent on the presence of CD4+ lymphocytes. Furthermore, CD8+ lymphocytes (1) are activated by MHC class II disparate antigens and (2) play a significant role in the progression of lesion development. Finally, both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes contribute to CAV development via secretion of IFN-gamma, a known mediator of CAV in this model.

Although treatment of LEW rats with Rapamycin (RPM) prolongs the survival of LBNF1 cardiac allografts to ca. 50 days, it fails to prevent late activation of macrophage/monocyte-associated chemokines. A 7-day course with RPM or CsA was introduced at 1-week posttransplant in RPM-pretreated hosts. At day 35, intragraft mRNA expression of IL-2, IFN-gamma, TGF-beta, IL-12 (p40), MCP-1, and RANTES was evaluated. RPM as a sequential treatment markedly inhibited mRNA levels coding for IL-2/IFN-gamma, and MCP-1. However, RPM monotherapy failed to prevent the expression of IL-12 (p40) and RANTES. Adjunctive treatment with CsA markedly depressed IL-12 (p40) and RANTES, and to a lesser extent MCP-1 mRNA, as compared with RPM-treated groups. Significant increase of TGF-beta mRNA expression was revealed after sequential RPM and adjunctive CsA treatment. A combination of RPM and CsA is more effective in restraining mRNA expression than RPM alone; however, either therapy is associated with TGF-beta hyperexpression.

Preservation of the heart for transplantation after infusion of cardioplegia and extirpation of a cardiac allograft results in an ischemic insult to the myocardium. This ischemic insult may lead to a loss of function in the transplanted heart. Hypothermic perfusion preservation with an oxygen hemoglobin carrying solution may avert ischemic injury and lead to improved recovery of cardiac function. The purpose of this study was to compare cardiac function after 8 hours of continuous hypothermic perfusion with a unique polyethylene-glycol-hemoglobin (PEG-Hb) solution to hearts preserved by 4 hours of hypothermic ischemic storage. Freshly extirpated hearts served as functional controls. The hearts of 26 anesthetized and intubated New Zealand white rabbits were harvested after cold cardioplegic arrest. Group I (n = 12) hearts were perfused with a PEG-Hb solution at 20 degrees C and 30 mm Hg for 8 hours. PO2 was maintained > or = 500 mm Hg. Group II (n = 7) hearts were preserved by cold ischemic storage for 4 hours at 4 degrees C. Group III (n = 7) were tested immediately after harvest. Left ventricular (LV) function was measured in the nonworking state at 15 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours after transfer to a standard crystalloid Langendorff circuit. Measurement of LV developed pressure, peak + dP/dt and -dP/dt revealed a superior trend between Group I and Group II hearts in comparison with freshly extirpated hearts. Heart rate was similar among all groups throughout testing (p = ns). Coronary blood flow was not significantly different between groups. Continuous perfusion preservation of rabbit hearts for 8 hours with PEG-Hb solution at 30 mm Hg and 20 degrees C yielded LV function that was similar to 4 hours of ischemic hypothermic storage. Furthermore, return of cardiac function after 8 hours of perfusion preservation using this PEG-Hb solution may be superior to that obtained in freshly extirpated hearts. These data suggest that some recovery of myocardial function may occur during perfusion preservation with this PEG-Hb solution after the ischemic insult of cardioplegic arrest. Continuous perfusion preservation using this PEG-Hb solution deserves further investigation in large animal transplant models.

The mRNA levels were determined by a semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method in 39 samples of endomyocardial biopsies obtained from 10 adult cardiac transplant recipients within the first six months after transplantation. Biopsies with ongoing acute rejection showed significantly higher CD40L, IFN-gamma and FasL mRNA expression than biopsies without rejection. The median values of mRNA expression in biopsies with and without rejection were 0.116 and zero for CD40L (P<0.003), 0.080 and zero for IFN-gamma (P<0.0009), and 0.156 and zero for FasL (P<0.002), respectively. In addition, the levels of IFN-gamma mRNA were significantly increased 7 to 15 days before the appearance of histological evidence of rejection (median of 0.086 in pre-rejection biopsies), i.e., they presented a predictive value.

Cyclosporine is used widely as an immunosuppressant in transplant recipients and for various autoimmune diseases. In some cases, these patients require therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). Cyclosporine is known to be highly bound to lipoproteins, and their removal by TPE would be expected to have an impact on drug dosing. We studied cyclosporine kinetics in a 54-year-old woman who is status post-cardiac transplant and has been receiving weekly TPE for familial hypercholesterolemia. We obtained serial measurements of cyclosporine, low-density lipoproteins, and high-density lipoproteins at scheduled times related to the dosing of the medication on days that she received TPE versus a day she did not. We also measured cyclosporine, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein levels in the fixed volume (3.5 L) of the discarded plasma. Our results show a similar rate of decline of serum cyclosporine levels on TPE days as compared with a day without TPE. Net cyclosporine in the discarded plasma was found to be approximately 1 mg per treatment or less, a relatively insignificant amount when compared with the ingested daily dose of 150 to 250 mg twice a day. Despite substantial removal of lipoproteins, there is minimal impact of TPE on serum levels of cyclosporine, and dosage adjustment is not needed for patients undergoing this procedure.

The prevention of xenograft rejection is substantially dependent on inhibiting antibodies (Ab) produced by B-cells independently of T-cell signals (TI-1). Due to their ubiquitous biochemical mechanisms of action, the immunosuppressants currently employed not only fail to discriminate between B- and T-cells but also have a narrow therapeutic window and, thus, their prolonged use in complex immunosuppressive regimens is problematic. By capitalizing on the target enzyme-bound (DHODH) structure 1b of one of these compounds, leflunomide, and modulating part of its multiple mechanisms of action to gain selectivity, the quinoline-8-carboxamide 3 was designed as a potentially weak enzyme inhibitor but effective immunosuppressant. Compound 3 fulfilled the mechanistic criteria set and had 10-fold B-cell over T-cell selectivity. Its pyridyl analogue 4 was found to be a highly potent and selective B-cell immunosuppressant with a 75-fold selectivity for B- over T-cells (as judged by the MLR data) and no general cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 160-fold higher than those required to inhibit B-cells.

We investigated whether intraoperative gene delivery of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) into donor hearts before transplantation would have a similar effect on an entire organ. In an allogeneic rabbit heart transplant model, liposomes complexed to the gene encoding eNOS were infused into the donor coronary circulation before transplantation. By 24 hours after transplantation, calcium-dependent nitrite production was significantly higher in eNOS-transfected donor hearts than in the 3 control groups: donor hearts transfected with empty plasmids alone, donor hearts treated with diluent only, and untransplanted native hearts. Intramyocardial neutrophil and T-lymphocyte populations were halved in eNOS-transfected hearts compared with control donor hearts (P<0.05).

Current thought on this process of vascular remodeling assumes that neointimal vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells and endothelium in TA are graft-derived, holding that medial VSM cells proliferate and migrate into the subendothelial space in response to signals from inflammatory cells and damaged graft endothelium. Using MHC class I haplotype-specific immunohistochemical staining and single-cell PCR analyses, we show that the neointimal alpha-actin-positive VSM cells in rat aortic or cardiac allografts are of recipient and not of donor origin.

Cyclosporine treatment prevents neointima formation and preserves the vascular media in aortic allografts. Recipient-derived ECs do not replace graft endothelium after cyclosporine treatment.

Human TR6 could cross-react with mouse LIGHT in immunoprecipitation. TR6-Fc also downregulates cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity in vitro and graft-versus-host responses in mice.

The mRNA levels for CTL genes (perforin, granzyme B, and Fas ligand) were similar in rejecting kidneys in WT and GKO hosts, and the host Ab responses were similar. The administration of recombinant IFN-gamma to GKO hosts reduced but did not fully prevent the effects of IFN-gamma deficiency: MHC was induced, but the prevention of necrosis and induction of MIG were incomplete compared with WT hosts. Thus, IFN-gamma has unique effects in vascularized allografts, including induction of MHC and MIG, and protection against parenchymal necrosis, probably at the level of the microcirculation. This is probably a local action of IFN-gamma produced in large quantities in the allograft. ", "label": 0}{"text": "Heart transplantation--surgical results. Heart transplantation has become a widely used therapeutic option for the treatment of end-stage heart failure. Since the first human orthotopic heart transplant in the late 1960s, the surgical technique has undergone several revisions. These revisions have addressed certain anatomic and geometric distortions that occurred with the original biatrial technique of Lower and Shumway. Early revisions have included the use of a bicaval technique for implanting the right atrium. Subsequently, the additional use of a direct pulmonary venous anastomosis has lead to the surgical concept of the total orthotopic heart transplant. These revisions of the original bi-atrial technique have led to a decrease in atrial size and distortion, conduction abnormalities and tricuspid and mitral valve regurgitation. This has also resulted in less atrial thromboembolic events, less need for permanent postoperative pacemaker placement, and in an overall increase in right and left heart performance in the early postoperative period. Overall, this has contributed to better clinical results with patients returning sooner to their normal exercise capacity. Ninety percent of heart transplant patients lead a relatively normal lifestyle having no limitations in their activity and 40 % return to work. We believe that the technique of total orthotopic heart transplantation has improved surgical results and clinical outcomes. ", "label": 0}{"text": "Heart transplantation in the young and elderly.

Preservation of rat hearts was extended to 16 hr when nitroglycerine (NTG) was added to colloid-free University of Wisconsin solution (MUW). This study examined the effectiveness of Celsior solution (CEL) and whether adding NTG to CEL would improve and extend cardiac preservation. Two studies were conducted: (a) 9-hr preservation with either CEL or MUW, (b) 16-hr preservation with CEL, CEL+NTG, or MUW+NTG. Rat heart isografts were flushed and stored at 0 degrees C before heterotopic transplantation with an indwelling externalized intraventricular balloon-tipped catheter. One and 7 days after transplantation, quantitative functional studies were performed. After 9-hr preservation, all (6/6) grafts preserved with MUW beat for 7 days, whereas only 1/6 hearts preserved with CEL continued to beat. After 16-hr preservation, 6/10 CEL+NTG hearts beat for 7 days compared with 7/8 MUW+NTG hearts; none of the hearts preserved with CEL survived. Function was similar in CEL+NTG and MUW+NTG groups on day 1 (left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP): CEL+NTG=64+/-16, MUW+NTG=104+/-16 mmHg; maximum dP/dt: CEL+ NTG=2024+/-551, MUW+NTG=3582+/-513 mmHg/sec) and day 7: (LVDP: CEL+NTG=126+/-25, MUW+NTG=177+/-24 mmHg; maximum dP/dt: CEL+NTG=3835+/-848, MUW+ NTG=5639+/-670 mmHg/sec).

The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of anti-Gal Abs and non-anti-Gal Abs in hyperacute rejection (HAR) of concordant pancreas xenografts compared with heart xenografts. In addition, we tested whether rejection of Lewis rat pancreas grafts was T-cell dependent and could be prevented by anti-T-cell treatment. To determine the role of anti-Gal Abs in the induction of HAR, Lewis rat pancreas and heart xenografts were transplanted into alpha1,3Galactosyltransferase knockout (GT-Ko) mice treated with normal human serum (NHS) or hyperimmune serum, or into presensitized GT-Ko mice. To investigate whether rejection of pancreas xenograft was mediated by a T-cell dependent response, Lewis rat pancreas grafts were transplanted into streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic GT-Ko mice treated with FK506, anti-CD4 mAbs (GK1.5), and thymectomy. Antidonor-specific IgM and IgG and anti-Gal Abs were analyzed by flow cytometry. Rejected and long-term surviving pancreas xenografts were assessed by functional (blood glucose) and histopathological examination. HAR of Lewis rat pancreas xenografts could not be induced by NHS (0.4 ml), whereas NHS (0.2 ml) resulted in HAR of Lewis heart xenografts. Infusion of Lewis rat-specific hyperimmune serum (0.2 ml) resulted in HAR of Lewis rat pancreas xenografts. In addition, second Lewis rat pancreas grafts were hyperacutely rejected by presensitized GT-Ko mice. Immunohistochemical staining showed a low expression of Galalpha1,3Gal antigen in the endocrine tissue compared with that in the cardiac grafts. The levels of anti-Gal Abs in pancreas xenograft transplantation did not increase in GT-Ko mice after pancreas xenograft transplantation that was significantly increased after heart transplantation. FK506 treatment induced long-term survival of Lewis pancreas xenografts (mean survival time (MST) >90 days). Anti-CD4 treatment delayed rejection of Lewis rat pancreas xenografts with MST of 34.3 days, whereas anti-CD4, in combination with thymectomy, synergistically prolonged survival of pancreas xenograft (MST=70.4 days). Pancreas xenograft is resistant to anti-Gal Abs-induced HAR but is susceptible to anti-donor specific Abs.

We evaluated them for the selection of heart donors and as predictors of early graft failure after heart transplantation. cTnI, cTnT, myoglobin, and creatine kinase (CK) levels and its isoenzyme MB (CKMB) activity and mass were measured in serum samples immediately before opening the pericardium from 126 consecutive brain-dead multi-organ donors over 10 years of age inspected by our harvesting team. Donors with serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL (n=6) were excluded from the analysis. Donors for high-urgency status recipients (n=2) were also excluded. The remaining donors were retrospectively divided into three groups: group I (n=68), grafts with good function; group II (n=11), grafts with impaired function; and group III (n=39), grafts not accepted for transplantation. No differences in donor and recipient characteristics were found among the groups. The mean values of cTnI (0.36+/-0.88 microg/L, 4.45+/-3.28 microg/L, and 3.02+/-7.88 micog/L, respectively) and cTnT (0.016+/-0.029 microg/L, 0.134+/-0.114 microg/L, and 0.123+/-0.245 microg/L, respectively) were lower in group I when compared with groups II or III (cTnI: P<0.0001, P=0.018; cTnT: P<0.0001, P=0.012). The cTnI value was higher in group II compared with group III (P=0.023). The cTnT values were similar in groups II and III. A cTnI value >1.6 microg/L as a predictor of early graft failure had a specificity of 94%, and a cTnT value of >0.1 microg/L had a specificity of 99%. The odds ratio for the development of acute graft failure after heart transplantation was 42.7 for donors with cTnI >1.6 microg/L and 56.9 for donors with cTnT >0.1 microg/L. No differences of myoglobin, CKMB activity, or CKMB/CK ratio were found among the groups. Significantly higher cTnI and cTnT values were found in peripheral blood at the time of explantation in donors of hearts with subsequently impaired graft function and in not accepted donors. cTnI and cTnT are useful as additional parameters for heart donor selection.

Our most recent observation that i.v. injection of Wistar-Furth (WF) major histocompatibility complex Class I peptide 5 (P5)-pulsed self-myeloid or lymphoid dendritic cells (DC) induces transplantation tolerance suggests that adoptive transfer of in vivo allopeptide-primed host T cells might induce acquired tolerance through their interaction with thymic DC. To examine this hypothesis, host myeloid DC cultured in rat granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor and interleukin 4 were pulsed in vitro with P5 and injected intravenously into syngeneic ACI rats. The T cells primed to P5 via the indirect pathway of allorecognition were harvested 7 days later and administered by either intravenously or intrathymically into syngeneic ACI recipients of WF cardiac allografts. Syngeneic T cells obtained from the spleen of P5-primed rats had a high mixed lymphocyte reaction proliferative response to P5 presented by self-DC. I.v. administration of 2x107 P5-primed alloreactive purified host splenic T cells alone on day -7 significantly (P<0.001) prolonged cardiac allograft survival from 10.5+/-1.0 days to 18.6+/-1.8 days in the WF-to-ACI rat combination. I.v. injection of P5-activated host T cells combined with 0.5 ml antilymphocyte serum (ALS)-transient immunosuppression on day -7 led to 100% donor-specific permanent graft survival (>200 days). Thymectomy before i.v. injection of P5-activated syngeneic T cells led to acute graft rejection, suggesting that the homing of in vivo activated T cells to the host thymus might play a role in the induction of tolerance. To further define the role of the recipient thymus in this model, we examined the effects of intrathymic (i.t.) injection of P5-primed alloreactive T cells on graft survival and found that i.t. administration of the P5-primed T cells on day -7 alone significantly prolonged graft survival (15.0+/-0.7 days) and when combined with 0.5 ml ALS led to donor-specific permanent graft survival. The long-term unresponsive recipients permanently (>100 days) accepted second-set donor-specific cardiac allografts but not third-party (Lewis) grafts. These findings demonstrate that the adoptive transfer of splenic T cells primed to an indirectly presented donor peptide induces transplantation tolerance in a transiently immunosuppressed secondary syngeneic recipient. Our data suggest that the interaction of thymic DC with activated peripheral T cells induces alloantigen (Ag)-specific T-cell tolerance by either inactivation or deletion of alloreactive T cells in the thymus. This observation provides the first formal evidence that the interaction between thymic DC and activated peripheral T cells that continuously circulate through the thymus plays an important role in the induction and maintenance of Ag-specific tolerance.

Although it has been well established that the microchimerism occurs in the peripheral blood of the recipients after various settings in both clinical and experimental organ transplantation, nevertheless, their roles in inducing and maintaining acquired transplantation tolerance are controversial. Furthermore, regarding the cell lineages, kinetics, and functions of the cells that constitute the microchimerism after organ transplantation, solid information is not available. Using rat heterotopic heart isografts from bone marrow chimeras between cross-sex and applying polymerase chain reaction with specific primers to rat sex determining region of Y chromosome, a relationship between a state of microchimerism and induction as well as maintenance of acquired tolerance to H-Y antigen were examined. Microchimeric cells of the peripheral blood (MCPB) after cardiac grafting contain bone marrow-derived and radiation-sensitive cells. Furthermore, removal of the primary cardiac grafts revealed that microchimeric cells in the peripheral blood are long-lived cells, i.e., more than 6 months. When the female rats that had contained long-lasting MCPB, were innoculated with syngeneic male dendritic cells, failure to sensitize female toward male specific antigen H-Y was found to occur. Thus it was suggested that radiation-sensitive, bone marrow derived, long-lived MCPB play a significant role in maintaining acquired transplantation tolerance to minor histocompatibility antigen H-Y.

The multifunctional cytokine transforming growth factor- (TGF) beta1 is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of graft vascular disease (GVD). Polymorphisms at codon 10, (Leu10-->Pro) and codon 25 (Arg25-->Pro) in the signal sequence of the TGF-beta1 gene regulate the production and secretion of the protein. We investigated whether these polymorphisms are risk factors for the development of GVD after clinical heart transplantation. TGF-beta1 polymorphisms, Leu10-->Pro and Arg25-->Pro, were determined in DNA from heart transplant recipients (n=252) and their donors (n=213), using sequence-specific oligonucleotide probing. GVD was angiographically diagnosed 1 year after transplantation. In addition other potential risk factors including underlying disease, recipient and donor age, recipient and donor gender, number of acute rejections in the first year, cold ischemia time, and HLA mismatches were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Univariate analysis showed that the recipient TGF-beta1 polymorphism Leu10-->Pro, (P=0.056, chi2 test), underlying disease (P=0.01, chi2 test), number of acute rejections in the first-year (P=0.03, analysis of variance), and donor age (P<0.001, analysis of variance) were risk factors for the development of GVD. The TGF-beta1 Arg25-->Pro polymorphism was not a risk factor. Also in the multivariate analysis, the recipient TGF-beta1 codon 10 polymorphism was associated with GVD, with patients homozygous for Pro at greatest risk (odds ratio 7.7, P=0.03). Apart for the recipient TGF-beta1 Leu10-->Pro polymorphism, donor age appeared to be an independent risk factor for the development of GVD at 1 year. Patients with older donor hearts were at greater risk than patients receiving grafts from younger donors (odds ratio 1.1/year, P<0.001). Recipient TGF-beta1 Leu10-->Pro polymorphism and higher donor age are independent risk factors for the development of GVD after clinical heart transplantation.

Therefore, every effort to identify patients with asymptomatic carcinomas before transplantation should be encouraged. Sixty-seven patients referred for heart transplantation were examined adhering to the scheme proposed at the 24th Bethesda Conference. To increase the sensitivity of this work-up, the following items were added: tumor marker assays (prostate-specific antigen in males, carcino embryogenic antigen), abdominal ultrasound, CT scan of the abdomen and the thorax, mammography/echography of the breasts, PAP smear, colonoscopy if carcino embryogenic antigen abnormal or occult blood in stool, prostate echography if prostate-specific antigen abnormal or prostate hypertrophy. Carcinoma was detected in 10 of the 67 patients; for 8 patients of this cancer group, transplantation was denied. Importantly, 9 of the 10 malignancies were detected by means of the diagnostic items that were added to the standard screening protocol. There were no significant differences between the cancer and the non-cancer group regarding mean age, sex, etiology of heart failure, and smoking history.

Members of the Clinical Practice Committee, American Society of Transplantation, have attempted to define referral criteria for solid organ transplantation. Work done by the Clinical Practice Committee does not represent the official position of the American Society of Transplantation. Recipients for solid organ transplantation are growing in numbers, progressively outstripping the availability of organ donors. As there may be discrepancies in referral practice and, therefore, inequity may exist in terms of access to transplantation, there needs to be uniformity about who should be referred to transplant centers so the system is fair for all patients. A review of the literature that is both generic and organ specific has been conducted so referring physicians can understand the criteria that make the patient a suitable potential transplant candidate. The psychosocial milieu that needs to be addressed is part of the transplant evaluation. Early intervention and evaluation appear to play a positive role in maximizing quality of life for the transplant recipient. There is evidence, especially in nephrology, that the majority of patients with progressive failure are referred to transplant centers at a late stage of disease. Evidence-based medicine forms the basis for medical decision-making about accepting the patient as a transplant candidate. The exact criteria for each organ are detailed. These guidelines reflect consensus opinions, synthesized by the authors after extensive literature review and reflecting the experience at their major transplant centers. These guidelines can be distributed by transplant centers to referring physicians, to aid them in understanding who is potentially an acceptable candidate for transplantation. The more familiar physicians are with the exact criteria for specific organ transplantation, the more likely they are to refer patients at an appropriate stage. Individual transplant centers will make final decisions on acceptability for transplantation based on specific patient factors. It is hoped that this overview will assist insurers/payors in reimbursing transplant centers for solid organ transplantation, based on criteria for acceptability by the transplant community.

We measured complement activation products, C4d (classical pathway) and SC5b-9 (terminal pathway), at the time of routine endomyocardial biopsy in heart transplant recipients. Ten patients in the immediate posttransplantation period (0-100 days) and 19 patients more than 6 months after transplantation were studied. No correlation was found between plasma levels of complement activation fragments and the presence of biopsy-proven acute allograft rejection or AGA (assessed by coronary angiography). However, plasma C4d and SC5b-9 were significantly elevated in 9 of 10 and 7 of 10 patients, respectively, in the immediate posttransplantation period. This was followed by progressive decrease in the levels of C4d and SC5b-9 fragments during the first 4-6 weeks after transplantation. We conclude that measuring plasma levels of fragments C4d and SC5b-9 is not a useful noninvasive method for detecting acute rejection or AGA after heart transplantation.

Four patients presented with variable degrees of endobronchial obstruction, and one patient presented with massive hemoptysis. Two of the patients with endobronchial obstruction were double lung transplant recipients who developed anastomotic strictures. The strictures were opened with endobronchial stents but became obstructed again by inflammatory granulation tissue overgrowth through the stent mesh. APC was used to maintain airway patency. One kidney transplant recipient developed pulmonary zygomycosis with secondary obstruction of the left main bronchus because of granulation tissue growth through endobronchial stents. Airway patency was reestablished with several treatments with APC. Another kidney transplant recipient developed subglottic and tracheal papillomatosis that was effectively removed with APC. A heart transplant recipient was referred with recurrent massive hemoptysis refractory to bronchial artery embolization. The bleeding was caused by hemorrhagic polypoid lesions, which were completely ablated by APC.

Pravastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, has been shown to be effective and safe for cholesterol reduction in adult heart transplant recipients. To our knowledge the safety and efficacy of pravastatin therapy in pediatric and adolescent heart transplant populations have not been previously analyzed. Therefore, we evaluated lipid profiles, liver transaminases, rejection data, and possible side effects in pediatric and adolescent cardiac transplant recipients treated with pravastatin. The study group consisted of 40 cardiac transplant recipients 10 to 21 years old (mean age 16.9 years). Twenty-two patients received pravastatin in addition to an immunosuppressive regimen of either cyclosporine or tacrolimus, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. Serial determinations of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides were available for all pravastatin-treated patients. Pre-treatment lipid values and hepatic transaminases were compared with those measured after therapy with pravastatin. Comparison of pravastatin-induced lipid reduction between groups treated with cyclosporine vs tacrolimus was also made. Patients receiving pravastatin experienced a mean 32 mg/dl decrease in TC (p < 0.005) and a mean 31 mg/dl decrease in LDL (p < 0.005), regardless of their immunosuppressive regimen. No statistical differences occurred in the magnitude of mean lipid reduction induced by pravastatin between the groups treated with cyclosporine vs tacrolimus. No significant changes in hepatic transaminase levels were noted, and no clinical evidence of pravastatin-induced myositis occurred in any subjects. Pravastatin therapy is effective and safe when used in pediatric and adolescent cardiac transplant recipients. Although the pravastatin-induced reduction in TC and LDL was more pronounced in patients receiving cyclosporine, the reduction was not statistically different from that in the tacrolimus group.

Cytokines play a major role in the inflammatory and immune responses that mediate allograft outcome. Several studies have shown that the production of cytokines varies among individuals and these variations are determined by genetic polymorphisms, most commonly within the regulatory region of the cytokine gene. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of these allelic variations on acute rejection after pediatric heart transplantation. We performed cytokine genotyping using polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primers in 93 pediatric heart transplant recipients and 29 heart donors for the following functional polymorphisms: tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (-308), interleukin (IL)-10 (-1082, -819, and -592), TGF-beta1 (codon 10 and 25), IL-6 (-174), and interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) (+874). The distribution of polymorphisms in this population did not differ from published controls. The patients were classified as either non-rejecters (0 or 1 episode) or rejecters (> 1 episode) based on the number of biopsy proven rejection episodes in the first year after transplantation. Forty-two of the 69 TNF-alpha patients (61%) in the low producer group were non-rejecters, while 9 of the 24 (37.5%) with high TNF-alpha were non-rejecters (p = 0.047). In contrast, IL-10 genotype showed the opposite finding. Forty-two of the 66 patients (64%) in the high and intermediate IL-10 group were non-rejecters, while 9 of the 26 (35%) in the low IL-10 group were non-rejecters (p = 0.011). The combination of low TNF-alpha with a high or intermediate IL-10 genotype was associated with the lowest risk of rejection (34/49 or 69% non-rejecters). Neither the distribution of the IL-6, INF-gamma, and TGF-beta1 genotype in recipients nor the donor genotype showed any association with acute rejection. Genetic polymorphisms that have been associated with low TNF-alpha and high IL-10 production are associated with a lower number of acute rejection episodes after pediatric heart transplantation.

To date leukocytes have been known to play a major role in reperfusion injury and have directed attention to leukocyte-endothelium interaction. This study was designed to investigate how much graft viability and the coronary microcirculatory function could be preserved by leukocyte depletion (LD) in a model of orthotopic cardiac transplantation. The heart in 10 beagle dogs was arrested by introducing a 4 degrees C St. Thomas' cardioplegic solution. They were harvested, immersed in the cold saline for 3 hours, and then orthotopically transplanted. Five recipients underwent LD (LD group) at reperfusion with the use of a Pall BC1B leukocyte depleting filter inserted into the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit. The other 5 dogs without filtration served as a control group. Leukocytes were about 80% filtrated and neutrophils were also 85% filtrated during the first 30 minutes of reperfusion in the LD group. A high level of adenosine triphosphate was maintained after transplantation in the LD group. The polymorphonuclear elastase level was significantly lower in the LD group. The cardiac function assessed by the slopes of the end-systolic pressure volume relation after transplantation was significantly higher in the LD group than in the control group (p < 0.05). The coronary vascular resistance responses to acetylcholine and nitroglycerin after transplantation were preserved significantly better in the LD group than in the control group (p < 0.05). These results suggest that a leukocyte depleting filter placed in the CPB circuit would prevent leukocyte-mediated endothelial cell injury, improve microcirculation of the myocardium, and lead to excellent graft function.

The classic dogma, still prevalent in cardiology, that the adult myocardium is a terminally differentiated tissue unable to produce new cardiomyocytes needs to be revised in light of recent results. In human and experimental animals there is now incontrovertible evidence that new myocytes are continuously generated throughout life in response to physiological and pathological stimuli. Moreover, the elucidation of mechanisms responsible for the hypertrophic response indicate similarity and overlap with the mechanisms involved in cell death by apoptosis as well as cell growth. During cardiac development, from birth to adulthood, there is a balance between the stimuli induce cell growth -by hypertrophy and hyperplasia- on one hand and those that induce programmed cell death on the other. In human and experimental animals it has been well documented that pathological conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, can increase dramatically the rate of cell death. Moreover, high rates of cell death have been measured in normal adult human hearts and those of mice and rats. No surprisingly, these values increase significantly with age and high in senescence. By themselves, these high rates of normal cell death provide a very compelling argument in favor of cardiomyocyte regeneration. Without cell renewal, these rates of cell death would be incompatible with survival because the heart would disappear before early adulthood. As expected, direct measurement of rates of new cell formation in adult hearts demonstrate high rates of cell renewal that compensate for cell death. Thus, the heart is in continuous cellular turnover with new myocardial cells replacing the older ones. Experiments with fetal mouse cardiocytes shows that the retinoblastoma protein is responsible for the cardiocyte withdrawal from the cell cycle during development. The identification in the adult heart of a subpopulation of quiescent cells that have many of the characteristics of stem cells able to rapidly enter the cell cycle and generate new cardiocytes is yet another evidence that the heart continuously produces new cardiocytes to replace those that disappear either by apoptosis or necrosis.Surprisingly, stem cells other that those from the heart are able to produce new cardiocytes and repopulate the myocardium. We have used bone marrow stem cells injected into the border zone of post-coronary occlusion necrosis. Remarkably, these cells have proven to be very effective in generating new myocardium in the necrotic zone that is integrated to the rest of the muscle and irrigated by new vessels. These results demonstrate that stem cells provide a new avenue for the generation of new contractile tissue. This approach could prove useful in the treatment of chronic cardiac failure and post-ischemic necrosis. ", "label": 0}{"text": "[Hypothyroidism and myocardial damage in cardiac donors].

The use of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A (CsA) in solid organ transplantation can be associated with the development of vasculopathy as part of the complex immune response involved in chronic rejection, including autoimmune recognition. Although CsA can directly affect endothelial cells, this drug alters the T cell repertoire promoting autoimmune recognition. The present studies evaluated the ability of CsA-induced autoreactive T cells to mediate vascular lesions in syngeneic heart grafts. Graft vasculopathy developed in syngeneic heart grafts following either the primary induction of autoimmunity with CsA or the adoptive transfer of CsA-induced autoreactive T cells. Initially, an inflammatory response occurred in the medial wall of the small arterial vessels, accompanied by a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate (including a lymphocytic infiltrate into the myocardium), followed by progression of vascular disease with endothelial cell proliferation. The development and progression of vascular disease correlated with the cytokine profile of the infiltrating lymphocytes with type 1 cytokines detected early and type 2 cytokines detected as the disease progressed. Initiation of this response correlated with upregulation of the target antigen recognized by the CsA-induced autoreactive T cells, the MHC class II-invariant chain peptide complex. This antigen complex, when upregulated on endothelial cells by interferon, allowed effective targeting by the autoreactive T lymphocytes. Strategies to inhibit the upregulation of MHC class II antigens by treatment of the recipients with chloroquine truncated the disease process. The results of these studies suggest that CsA-induced autoreactive mechanisms can contribute to the development of graft vasculopathy.

To address this question, we transplanted CD28-deficient mice with fully allogeneic vascularized cardiac allografts and studied the effect of selective blockade of B7-1 or B7-2. These mice reject their grafts by a mechanism that involves both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Blockade of CTLA-4 or B7-1 significantly accelerated graft rejection. In contrast, B7-2 blockade significantly prolonged allograft survival and, unexpectedly, reversed the acceleration of graft rejection caused by CTLA-4 blockade. Furthermore, B7-2 blockade prolonged graft survival in recipients that were both CD28 and CTLA-4 deficient.

To test the hypothesis that altered loading conditions play a key role in hemodynamic instability and cardiac dysfunction in the brain dead (BD) organ donor. BD was induced by inflation of a subdural balloon catheter. In the first part of the study, left ventricular function was assessed in a canine in situ cross-circulated heart model (n=6). Pre- and afterload and coronary perfusion pressure were kept identical in all hearts throughout the experiment. In the second part of the study, hearts (n=6) were investigated in vivo allowing the interaction between left ventricular contractility and arterial load. Left ventricular pressure--volume loops were obtained by a combined conductance-pressure catheter and the slope of the endsystolic pressure--volume relationship (Ees), arterial elastance (Ea), stroke work (SW), pressure--volume area, ventriculo--arterial coupling ratio (VAC) and mechanical efficiency (Eff) were calculated. Induction of BD led to a hyperdynamic response in both models with a significant increase of most hemodynamic parameters. In the in situ isolated heart model, left ventricular contractility returned to baseline without any further deterioration. In contrast, in the intact circulation the hemodynamic parameters declined significantly in comparison to baseline 4 h after BD (Ees: 4.07+/-0.51 vs. 8.06+/-1.09 mmHg/ml, P<0.05, Ea: 3.17+/-0.39 vs. 4.42+/-0.30 mmHg/ml, P<0.05).

BD induction leads to an initial hyperdynamic reaction followed by hemodynamic instability. The facts that no cardiac dysfunction occurred if loading conditions were kept constant and the ventriculo--arterial coupling ratio and mechanical efficiency remained constant in the intact animal model indicate that decreased contractility reflects to decreased arterial elastance after brain death.

The program also included preemptive ganciclovir treatment for those patients with the highest risk of developing CMV disease, i.e., with either high-level viremia (>10 infectious units [IU]/106 PBL) or low-level viremia (<10 IU/106 PBL) and either D+/R- CMV serostatus or treatment for graft rejection. During 1995-96, 90 solid organ transplant recipients (39 kidneys, 28 livers, and 23 hearts) were followed up. A total of 60 CMV infection episodes occurred in 45 patients. Seventeen episodes were symptomatic. Of 26 episodes managed according to the program, only 4 presented with CMV disease and none died. No patient treated preemptively for asymptomatic infection developed disease. In contrast, among 21 episodes managed in non-compliance with the program (i.e., the monitoring was not performed or preemptive treatment was not initiated despite a high risk of developing CMV disease), 12 episodes turned into symptomatic infection (P=0.0048 compared to patients treated preemptively), and 2 deaths possibly related to CMV were recorded. This difference could not be explained by an increased proportion of D+/R- patients or an increased incidence of rejection among patients with episodes treated in non-compliance with the program. Our data identify compliance with guidelines as an important factor in effectively reducing CMV morbidity through preemptive treatment, and suggest that the complexity of the preemptive approach may represent an important obstacle to the successful prevention of CMV morbidity by this approach in the regular healthcare setting.

The recent development of powerful agents such as mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus has altered current regimens for the prevention and treatment of allograft rejection. Questions have been raised about these newer regimens in terms of susceptibility to opportunistic infections and effects on host defenses. Severe hypogammaglobulinemia has been infrequently described in solid organ transplant recipients, but has been recently noted in six heart transplant recipients at one center, of whom five were receiving a combination of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. Case summaries of six recent heart transplant recipients with total immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels of less than 310 mg/dl, five of whom had cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and three of whom had multiple infections including Nocardia, invasive Trichophyton, and Acinetobacter bacteremia. Previous literature was reviewed with the aid of a Medline search using the search terms hypogammaglobulinemia; kidney, liver, heart, lung, and organ transplantation; mycophenolate mofetil; tacrolimus; cyclosporine; azathioprine; and nocardiosis. We here report six cardiac transplant recipients seen over a period of one year who were found to have immunoglobulin G levels of 310 mg/dl or below (normal: 717-1400 mg/dl). The first five patients were diagnosed because of evaluation for infections; the sixth, who was asymptomatic with an IgG level of 175, was found during screening for hypogammaglobulinemia instituted as a result of these first five patients. All six patients had received steroid pulses for rejection; all received mycophenolate mofetil; and 5/6 had been switched from cyclosporine to tacrolimus because of steroid-resistant rejection. Transient neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than 1000) was observed in 2/6; 3/6 had received OKT3 therapy for refractory rejection. These six patients were treated with a combination of antimicrobials, immunoglobulin replacement, and decrease in immunosuppressive therapy. The finding of unexpected hypogammaglobulinemia and concomitant infectious complications in six heart transplant recipients highlights a possible complication in a subset of patients receiving newer immunosuppressive agents. A larger prospective study is underway to determine risk factors for development of post-transplant hypogammaglobulinemia and to assess pre-transplant immune status of these recipients. Monitoring of immunoglobulin levels in high-risk patients receiving intensified immunosuppressive therapy for rejection may help to prevent infectious complications.

Primary T cell activation requires B7-CD28 and CD40-CD154 costimulation, but effector T cell functions are considered to be largely independent of these costimulatory pathways. Although blockade of costimulation with cytolytic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4-immunoglobulin (CTLA-4-Ig) or monoclonal antibody (mAb) to CD154 prolongs allograft survival, chronic rejection follows, which suggests that additional key costimulatory pathways are active in vivo. We found that both antibody to inducible costimulator (anti-ICOS) and an ICOS-Ig fusion protein suppressed intragraft T cell activation and cytokine expression and prolonged allograft survival in a manner similar to that in ICOS-/- allograft recipients. The combination of anti-ICOS therapy and cyclosporin A led to permanent engraftment. In addition, ICOS-B7RP-1 costimulation was required for the development of chronic rejection after CD40-CD154 blockade. These data demonstrate a key role for the ICOS-B7RP-1 pathway in acute and chronic rejection and highlight the benefits of targeting this pathway in combination with the use of conventional immunosuppressive agent.

This study was designed to investigate the effects of the selective endothelin-B (ET-B) receptor agonist IRL1620 and the selective ET-B receptor antagonist BQ788 on myocardial and endothelial function after reversible deep hypothermic ischemia and reperfusion. Isogenic intraabdominal heterotopic heart transplantation was performed on Lewis rats. After one hour of cold ischemic preservation, reperfusion was started either after application of saline vehicle or IRL1620 or BQ788 or both. Left ventricular pressure-volume relations and myocardial blood flow were assessed after one and 24 hours of reperfusion. Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation to acetylcholine (ACH) and endothelium-independent vasodilatation to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were also determined. IRL1620 attenuated and BQ788 improved myocardial contractility significantly as indicated by the left or upward shift of the systolic pressure-volume relation, respectively, and significantly changed myocardial blood flow during early reperfusion (p<0.05). Although myocardial function and baseline myocardial blood flow were similar in both groups after 24 hours of reperfusion, endothelium-dependent vasodilatation was still significantly lower in the IRL1620 and higher in the BQ788 group (p<0.05). These results suggest that activation of the ET-B receptors contributes to reperfusion injury after cardiac preservation in a rat heart transplant model.

A PVG to ACI rat heterotopic heart transplantation model was used. Lu-Tex (10 mg/kg) was intravenously administered 90 days after transplantation. Photoactivation was performed 24 hr after Lu-Tex administration. A light-emitting diode, central wavelength of 742 nm, was used to illuminate the intraperitoneally placed allografts via a laparotomy (light fluence of 75 J/cm2 at a power density of 75 mW/cm2). Animals were divided into four groups according to postoperative treatments: PDT with Lu-Tex injection and light illumination (n=21), Lu-Tex injection and laparotomy (n=14), laparotomy with light only (n=14), and laparotomy only (n=16). GCAD was quantitatively assessed 14 days after treatments. Lu-Tex localized in atherosclerotic plaque in vessels with GCAD. PDT significantly reduced both the percent of affected vessels and intimal proliferation compared to all other control study groups. alpha-Smooth muscle cell actin and anti-rat macrophage antibody-positive areas were significantly reduced within the neointima in allografts treated with PDT compared to all other study groups.

We have previously demonstrated that mixed xenogeneic chimerism and donor-specific T-cell tolerance can be induced in the rat-to-mouse species combination by using a relatively nontoxic, nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen. However, natural antibodies (NAbs) against Galalpha1,3Gal (Gal) pose an additional major barrier to pig-to-human vascularized xenograft acceptance. To determine whether the mixed chimerism approach could also overcome this humoral barrier, T cell-depleted rat (GalT+/+) bone marrow cells (BMC) were transplanted to alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase deficient (GalT-/-) mice conditioned with a nonmyeloablative regimen, consisting of transient T cell and natural killer (NK) cell depletion, 3 Gy whole body irradiation, and 7 Gy thymic irradiation. By giving a high dose (180x106) of rat BMC, persistent mixed chimerism could be induced in GalT-/- mice, although the level of donor-type hematopoietic repopulation declined over time. Induction of mixed chimerism was associated with a rapid disappearance of anti-Gal and anti-rat NAb in the sera. Both anti-Gal Ab-producing cells and B cells with receptors recognizing Gal were undetectable in mixed chimeras, even when the chimerism levels declined, suggesting that a very low level of chimerism could effectively maintain B-cell tolerance to Gal, probably by clonal deletion and/or receptor editing. Mixed chimeras accepted subsequently transplanted donor-type rat hearts (>100 days) without immunosuppressive therapy, whereas delayed vascular and even hyperacute rejection of rat hearts occurred in conditioned control GalT-/- mice. Cellular rejection occurred by 5-6 days in conditioned control wild-type mice. These findings demonstrate that induction of mixed chimerism with a nonmyeloablative regimen can prevent vascularized xenograft rejection by cellular and anti-Gal Ab-dependent pathways in GalT+/+-to-GalT-/- species combinations.

We hypothesized that l-arginine polymers administered to cardiac allografts ex vivo would translocate across vascular cellular membranes, up-regulate inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) production of NO, and inhibit the development of GCAD. Three groups of PVG rat donor hearts were incubated with either 0.8 ml phosphate-buffered saline, (PBS, n=12) or 50 microM L-arginine polymer solutions of length five (R5, n=12) or nine (R9, n=12) prior to heterotopic transplantation into ACI recipients.

All subjects had been hemodialysis dependent before transplantation. Seven patients suffered from an intrinsic renal disease that were diabetic nephropathy in three cases, small fibrotic kidneys of undetermined origin in two cases, one lupus nephritis, and cyclosporine nephrotoxicity in one patient who had a previous heart transplant. In one patient renal insufficiency was considered to be solely due to renal hypoperfusion because no intrinsic renal disease could be detected. All patients were on cyclosporine-based triple immunosuppression, transplanted for 4 to 10 years, exhibited cardiac ejection fractions of more than 50% and had normal serum creatinine values. Radioisotopic scan showed no function of the native kidneys in all seven patients with intrinsic renal disease but exhibited normal function of the native kidneys as well as the renal transplant in the patient without intrinsic kidney disease before transplantation.

Histopathological analysis revealed classical acute cellular rejection with moderate to severe diffuse interstitial CD4+ and CD8+ cellular infiltrates and significant intra-graft deposition of IgG and complement. In contrast, HLA-A2+ grafts were not rejected when transplanted into CD4-KO mice or HLA-A2+ mice. CD8-KO recipients treated with an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody, but not with an anti-NK monoclonal antibody, failed to reject their allografts with prolonged administration of antibody (30 days). Spleen cells from mice rejecting HLA-A2+ allografts failed to lyse HLA-A2+ target cells indicating a lack of involvement of CD8+ T cells in the rejection process. In contrast, spleen cells from rejecting animals proliferated significantly to both HLA-A2+ cells and to a peptide derived from the HLA-A2 molecule. Development of anti-HLA-A2 antibodies was observed in all animals rejecting HLA-A2+ allografts.

At days 7 and 24, RANTES production by graft-infiltrating cells was defined with intracellular RANTES staining and multicolor FACS analysis. Intimal thickening was quantitated morphometrically. In murine hearts and in six explanted human hearts with advanced CAV, RANTES was also localized immunohistochemically. NK, NKT, and gammadelta+ cells, in addition to CD4+, CD8+ lymphocytes, and CD11b+ macrophages, produced RANTES in early and late stages of CAV. RANTES-producing NK, NKT, and gammadelta+ cells tripled in number during CAV development; by day 24, NK and gammadelta+ cells each outnumbered CD4+ lymphocytes and CD11b+ macrophages. The presence of CD4+ lymphocytes was required for sustained RANTES production in allografts, which correlated with mononuclear cell recruitment and preceded intimal thickening. In murine and explanted human hearts with advanced CAV, RANTES immunolocalized with graft-infiltrating mononuclear cells and vessel wall cells. We present evidence that other cell types in addition to CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, and CD11b+ macrophages contribute significantly to RANTES production in CAV. In this MHC II-mismatched murine model of CAV, sustained RANTES production requires CD4+ lymphocytes, correlates with mononuclear cell recruitment, and precedes intimal thickening. In experimental and human CAV, vessel wall cells may also produce RANTES. Interventions aimed at inhibiting RANTES production in CAV may need to target several types of cells, and neutralization of RANTES bioactivity may reduce mononuclear cell recruitment and CAV development.

However, little is known about the agreement between these 2 methods. Thus, correlation between (11)C-hydroxyephedrine (HED) PET and invasively measured norepinephrine (NE) release was investigated in transplant recipients in this study. Using PET and the catecholamine analog HED, 17 patients were studied between 2 mo and 13.6 y after transplantation. Based on results in completely denervated hearts, areas with HED retention >7%/min were defined as reinnervated. Additionally, transcardiac NE release induced by intravenous tyramine (55 microg/kg) was measured by coronary sinus and aortic catheterization within 1 wk of the PET study. NE levels between coronary sinus and aortic root, DeltaNE(CS-AO), were calculated at baseline and after tyramine administration. Differences of more than 3 SD of baseline (>163 pg/mL) were interpreted as reinnervation. HED retention indicated reinnervation in 10 patients. Maximal HED retention ranged from 4.3%/min to 16.4%/min. DeltaNE(CS-AO) 1 min after tyramine administration ranged between -10 pg/mL and 1157 pg/mL, and 8 patients were above the reinnervation threshold. Fisher's exact test demonstrated good agreement between results of PET and DeltaNE(CS-AO) measurements (P = 0.002). Maximal HED retention was also significantly correlated with NE release (r = 0.69; P = 0.001). Results of invasively measured NE release and noninvasive (11)C-HED PET are well correlated.

A GSC was defined as a condition for which a general surgeon had been consulted or as a general surgical condition recognized at the time of autopsy. The records of 453 consecutive patients who underwent OHT between 1981 and 1999 were reviewed to identify patients who developed a GSC. Kaplan-Meier actuarial analysis on this cohort, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression models applied to a subpopulation of 324 consecutive OHT patients between 1987 and 1997 were used to determine factors associated with and predictive of GSC after OHT. Of 453 OHT patients, 371 (81.9%) were men, and the average age was 44.5 +/- 15 (standard deviation) years. Median followup was 2,086 days (range 1 to 6,642 days). Ninety-three patients (20.5%) developed 111 GSCs. Of these, 78 were men, and the average age was 49.9+/-10.2 years. There were 83 general surgical interventions. Actuarial analyses revealed that age greater than 50 years, pretransplant diagnosis of ischemic (PTDxI) versus nonischemic heart disease, and previous general surgical history were factors associated (p < 0.05) with a higher GSC incidence. Gender, more urgent transplant priority status, cardiopulmonary bypass time, total graft ischemic time, and intensive care unit length of stay were not associated with GSC. Factors associated with GSC on univariate analysis, with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) included: age analyzed as a continuous variable (OR 1.04 per year; CI 1.01, 1.06 per year; p = 0.0021), PTDxI (OR 2.40; CI 1.39, 4.15; p = 0.0016), and pretransplant general surgical history (OR 3.35; CI 1.65, 6.82; p = 0.0008).

A pretransplant diagnosis of ischemic heart disease and previous history of a general surgical procedure are two independent risk factors that predispose OHT patients to development of GSC.

Our laboratory has studied the role of CD40 ligand (CD40L, CD154) in the primate immune response to allogenic and infectious challenges.

Monotherapy fails to prevent late graft loss, which often occurs in association with rising antidonor antibody titers and allograft vasculopathy, despite continuing anti-CD40L therapy. In contrast, the primary humoral response to T helper dependent influenza viral antigen is inhibited during anti-CD40L therapy, and responses to subsequent immunization are blunted after discontinuation of therapy. These results are encouraging with regard to the tolerogenic potential of costimulatory blockade for specific T helper dependent antigens.

Heart function parameters (aortic flow, coronary flow and cardiac output) were measured when the heart was reperfused following the 2, 4 or 6 h of preservation. The effects of nicorandil, an ATP-sensitive potassium channel opener, on heart function following preservation were also evaluated. Nicorandil was injected intravenously before heart harvesting. The results showed that the energy status was well preserved in the IPC groups. The 2-cycle IPC group showed better recovery of heart function following preservation. Pretreatment with nicorandil also improved functional recovery of the heart following preservation. The present study showed that IPC of the rat heart resulted in improved myocardial energy metabolism and functional recovery after hypothermic preservation, and that nicorandil has potential for pharmacological preconditioning in heart preservation for transplantation.

Diabetes mellitus that develops after organ transplantation may predispose patients to further complications. We studied the value of pre-transplant oral glucose tolerance testing or maximum random plasma glucose, and HLA-DR3 and/or DR4 phenotype as predictors of post-transplantation diabetes mellitus in heart transplant recipients. In 228 cardiac allograft recipients (median age, 50 years; mean follow-up, 4.77 years), we used either pre-transplant oral glucose tolerance testing results (Group I, n = 141)-excluding patients with pre-existing diabetes (n = 9)--or maximum random plasma glucose values (Group II, n = 78) to study predictability of post-transplant diabetes. In addition, we investigated its relation to rejection treatment and clinical course. Cumulative incidence of post-transplant diabetes (n = 43) was 19.6%, 83% of which became manifest within 3 months post-transplant; pre-transplant body mass index was higher (p < 0.01) in this group. Mortality did not increase. Of 123 patients in Group I who survived > 3 months, post-transplant diabetes occurred in 32% vs 16% of those with impaired and normal glucose tolerance respectively (ns), and in 55% of patients with isolated post-load hyperglycemia (p < 0.05 vs normal). Maximum random glucose values (Group II) did not predict post-transplant diabetes. Prevalence of the HLA-DR3, DR4, and DR3DR4 phenotypes did not increase in post-transplant diabetes; relation to rejection treatment was likely in 30%. Approximately 50% of posttransplant diabetes patients required only temporary drug treatment. The risk of post-transplant diabetes increased parallel to pre-transplant degree of glucose intolerance, but was considerable even in normal glucose tolerance.

Heart transplant (HTx) recipients risk acquiring hepatotropic viral infections such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and the impact of these infections on post-HTx survival remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to define the prevalence, clinical features, and natural history of HBV and HCV infections in a cohort of HTx recipients. We retrospectively studied 360 consecutive patients who had undergone HTx. Clinical picture, hepatic injury indexes, and HBV/HCV viral serology were followed post-transplant. During follow-up (average, 8 +/- 3.1 years), 49 (16.5%) of the HTx recipients tested positive for at least 1 of the 2 viruses (3.1% HBV, 12% HCV, 0.5% concomitant infection). The prevalence of HCV infection in heart transplant recipients transplanted before and after 1990 was 28% and 4.2%, respectively, the latter being markedly lower (p < 0.001) than in earlier series of HTx recipients and much lower than expected in the age- and sex-matched general population. All HBV-positive and 58% of HCV-positive recipients developed chronic liver disease. Sixteen percent of patients developed cirrhosis during follow-up, and 8% died of end-stage liver disease. The prevalence of HBV and HCV in a large population of HTx recipients is not very different from that reported in the general population. Active viral replication of HBV and an aggressive natural history of both infections are seen in HTx recipients, however. The low prevalence of HBV- and HCV-related infection in recent series probably reflects current viral screening and vaccination policies.

Historically, these patients were not considered operative candidates because of their high morbidity and mortality. Heart transplantation is now considered standard treatment for select patients with end-stage heart disease; however, it is applicable only to a small number of patients. In an effort to address this problem, newer and alternative surgical approaches are evolving, including mitral valve annuloplasty, the Batista procedure, and other left ventricular shape changing technologies.

We sought to determine the role of conventional atherosclerosis risk factors in the development and progression of transplant coronary artery disease (CAD) using serial intravascular ultrasound imaging. Transplant artery disease is a combination of allograft vasculopathy and donor atherosclerosis. The clinical determinants for each of these disease processes are not well characterized. Intravascular ultrasound imaging is the most sensitive tool to serially study these processes. Baseline intravascular ultrasound imaging was performed 0.9 +/- 0.5 months after transplantation to identify donor atherosclerosis. Follow-up imaging was performed at 1.0 +/- 0.07 year to evaluate progression of donor atherosclerosis and development of transplant vasculopathy. Conventional risk factors for CAD included recipient age, gender, smoking history, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Donor-transmitted atherosclerosis was present in 36 patients (39%). At follow-up, progression of donor lesions was seen in 15 patients (42%) and 42 patients (45%) developed transplant vasculopathy, leaving 35 patients (38%) without any disease. There was no difference in any conventional risk factors in patients with and without allograft vasculopathy. However, the severity of allograft vasculopathy was associated with a larger increase in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from baseline (p = 0.02). High one-year posttransplant serum triglyceride level and pretransplant body mass index were the only significant predictors (p = 0.03) for progression of donor atherosclerosis. Conventional atherosclerosis risk factors do not predict development of allograft vasculopathy, but greater change in serum LDL cholesterol level during the first year after transplant is associated with more severe vasculopathy. Therefore, maintenance of LDL cholesterol as close to pretransplant values as possible may help to limit the rate of progression of acquired allograft vasculopathy.

We tested a hypothesis that tranilast inhibits the vasculopathy characterized by diffuse intimal thickening in a murine heart transplantation model. Hearts from DBA/2 mice were heterotopically transplanted into B10.D2 mice as allografts. Oral administration of tranilast started 3 days before transplantation at doses of 550 or 1040 mg/kg per day until the animals were killed. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy was defined as luminal stenosis caused by neointimal formation. The percentage of luminal stenosis and cardiac rejection were analyzed 14 and 28 days after transplantation. Tranilast administration was associated with a marked reduction in luminal occlusion but with no significant effect on cardiac rejection. Immunohistochemical study of the tranilast-treated graft coronary arteries revealed enhancement of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and decreased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in the neointima.

Mean age was 53 years. Patients underwent two TT of peak VO(2) using the modified Naughton protocol and three (one practice) ISWT. Investigations were performed on consecutive days. Main outcome measures were repeatability of TT and ISWT assessments; relation between peak VO(2) and distance walked in the ISWT; and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to establish a distance walked in the ISWT that predicted which patients would have a peak VO(2) greater than 14 ml/min/kg. Both the ISWT and the TT were highly reproducible. Following the first practice walk, mean (SD) ISWT distances were 400.0 (146) m (ISWT2) and 401.3 (129) m (ISWT3), r = 0.90, p < 0.0001.

We have shown that a rare population of regulatory CD4+ T cells plays a key role in the acquisition of infectious tolerance in rat sensitized recipients of cardiac allografts pretreated with nondepleting anti-CD4 mAb. This study was designed to analyze the TCR Vbeta expression patterns in this transplantation model. First, we used Vbeta-specific RT-PCR to show that there was no differential usage of TCR Vbeta genes by T cells mediating rejection or tolerance. Indeed, graft-infiltrating lymphocytes expressed most of the 22 known rat TCR Vbeta genes in both recipient groups, suggesting unrestricted TCR Vbeta repertoire in alloreactive T cells. Then, we applied CDR3 spectrotyping of TCR beta-chain to assess the clonality of T cells at different anatomic sites. CDR3 size restriction, indicative of the presence of T cell clones, was observed in graft-infiltrating lymphocytes but not in draining lymph nodes or spleen of tolerant hosts. Consisent with the clonal expansion, T cells in tolerated grafts exhibited the memory phenotype at a much higher percentage as compared with peripheral lymphoid organs. Moreover, in tolerated graft-infiltrating lymphocytes, the CD3 size restriction occurred in limited Vbeta gene families, with Vbeta8.1 and Vbeta18 most frequently detected. Hence, T cells at the graft site of tolerant recipients contain T cell clones expressing selective Vbeta genes. This phenotypic characteristics of the tolerogenic GILs may potentially be used as a novel marker to identify operational regulatory T cells in organ allograft recipients.

Studies of cardiac allograft arteriosclerosis, i.e., chronic rejection, have largely focused on mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates in the vascular wall and periphery of the occluded vessels. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of mast cells in the development of acute and chronic rejection in rat cardiac allografts. In the acute rejection model, transplant recipients were not treated with immunosuppressants, and the grafts were removed 5 days after transplantation at the time of severe acute rejection. In the chronic rejection model, the recipients were administered triple-drug immunosuppression, and the grafts were removed 90 days after transplantation. During acute rejection, the number of mast cells was not increased, but the localization pattern differed from that of syngeneic grafts. In acute rejection, mast cells were located in the perivascular region of the allografts, but in syngeneic grafts, mast cells had a more interstitial location. In the chronic rejection model, the cardiac allografts with severe intimal thickening showed large numbers of mast cells at perivascular sites of occluded intramyocardial vessels and in the interstitium. Linear regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between the numbers of perivascular and interstitial mast cells and the intensity of intimal thickening. The majority of mast cells showed positive immunoreactivity to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Macrophage bFGF expression was not so prominent, but macrophages were more frequent in numbers. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression was detected mainly in macrophages and in only a few mast cells. When the intensity of arteriosclerosis was decreased by an increase in the intensity of immunosuppression, the numbers of intragraft mast cells and other mononuclear cells, and also the production of their respective cytokines, bFGF and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, gradually diminished. Taken together, our data show that the intensity of intramyocardial mast cell infiltration was associated with the intensity of chronic inflammation and allograft arteriosclerotic changes, but not with acute rejection, and that mast cells, in addition to macrophages, are a major source of myocardial bFGF. The results also demonstrate that when the T-cell activation pathway is blocked using cyclosporin, the number of mast cells is decreased. Cyclosporin may have affected the cytokine production that interfered with both the mast cell-dependent initiation and the leukocyte- and mast cell-dependent amplification and progression of the immune responses influenced by mast cell-leukocyte cytokine cascades. bFGF produced by mast cells may contribute to enhanced inflammation, neovascularization, and fibrosis during cardiac allograft arteriosclerosis.

Kinetics and role of host and donor dendritic cells (DCs) in transplantation immunity are still ill-defined.

Host and donor DCs were defined as host- or donor-type class II major histocompatibility complex antigen single-positive cells by double-immunostaining. Proliferative response of both donor and host cells were also analyzed. Host DCs were recruited to the graft soon after transplantation. These cells represented definitive precursors because of high labeling index by a continuous bromodeoxyuridine infusion, their small round shape, and their putative bone marrow origin. Donor interstitial DCs showed a significant self-replicating capability. Both recruited host DCs in a regraft experiment and donor DCs preferentially performed blood-borne migration to the T-cell area of host spleen. Furthermore, they also migrated to the T-cell area of hepatic lymph nodes after executing the sinusoids-lymph translocation as a novel pathway for these DCs. Selectively at their migration sites, a strong T-cell proliferative response occurred, which preceded that in the graft tissues. Removal of spleen and hepatic lymph nodes significantly prolonged the mean graft survival time. We conclude that allogeneic heart transplantation induces the recruitment of host DC precursors to the graft tissues and the blood-borne migration of both recruited host and donor DCs to the host spleen and hepatic nodes where effector cells are predominantly sensitized.

We proposed a protocol of step-by-step conversion from ECMO to LVAD after assurance of the reversibility of right ventricle and pulmonary function. After femoral venoarterial ECMO was inserted for the critical patients, the left atrial drainage was added to the ECMO firstly and the femoral arterial inflow was shifted to the ascending aorta for preventing possible peripheral vascular complications. Temporary clamp of right heart drainage was tried to test right heart function 24 to 48 hours later. The sweep gas flow of oxygenator could be reduced gradually to test the pulmonary function. Therefore, the right heart drain and the oxygenator could be withdrawn to become a non-pulsatile LVAD or shift to pneumatic LVAD directly.

The transplant group was significantly younger (54.8 years) than the nontransplant group (70.0) and contained more men (88%) than women (51%). AKs from transplant recipients were statistically more likely to demonstrate bacterial colonization, confluent parakeratosis, hyperkeratosis, increased mitotic activity, and verrucous changes. After controlling for age only, hyperkeratosis failed to be more prevalent in the transplant group. Certain histopathologic features are more common in AKs of immunosuppressed transplant recipients and may be used to distinguish between those removed from otherwise healthy persons.

Pre-graft priming of heart allograft recipients with donor strain blood induces tolerance in 100% of adult rats in the congenic LEW.1W to LEW.1A combination. This tolerant state is specific for donor MHC antigens as third-party blood transfusions fail to induce tolerance, and third-party skin grafts are promptly rejected by tolerant graft recipients. In this study we have characterized the immunodominant donor (RT1u) class I and II allogenic peptides which elicit an in vitro proliferative response to splenocytes from recipients (RT1a) undergoing acute rejection or tolerant to a LEW.1A cardiac allograft. Paradoxically, splenocytes from tolerant animals responded more vigorously to a broader set of donor peptides than splenocytes from rejecting animals. In addition, several of these peptides were observed to be stimulatory only for tolerant splenocytes. These findings suggest that regulatory cells may be involved in tolerance induction or maintenance and are selected by specific motifs, which could be utilized for manipulating the immune system of graft recipients.

The metabolic side effects of steroids are well known and could lead to significant morbidity and mortality in the posttransplant period. There is growing evidence to suggest that steroids may not be a requirement for adequate immunosuppression and that morbidity may be reduced by withdrawing steroids in select patients. We have reviewed our series of patients undergoing heart transplantation in whom steroids were weaned postoperatively. We retrospectively reviewed all adult patients undergoing heart transplantation at our institution between November 1993 and April 2000 treated with a-triple-drug immunosuppressive regimen. Medications were recorded at discharge and at 6, 12, and 24 months posttransplant to determine the success of steroid weaning. Freedom from infection and rejection as well as overall survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods. By 24 months posttransplant, almost 70% of patients were receiving double-drug therapy. Survival for the entire group was excellent with 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival of 98%+/-2.0%, 93.2%+/-3.8%, and 88.3%+/-6.0%, respectively. Freedom from rejection at 6 months was 60.7%+/-6.5%, at 1 year was 60.7%+/-6.5%, and at 2 years was 58.5%+/-6.7%. Infectious complications were low with freedom from infection at 6 months of 78.5+/-5.5%, at 1 year of 76.5%+/-5.7%, and at 2 years of 72.0%+/-6.2%. Our data suggest that an immunosuppressive regimen without long-term steroid administration results in excellent survival rates without an apparent increase in rejection or infectious complications.

Cardiac harvest teams are usually committed to immediately transfer the explanted donor heart into its cold storage solution. We tested the opposite hypothesis that a brief prestorage episode of heat-enhanced ischemic preconditioning could be protective. Fifty-three isolated isovolumic rat hearts underwent 4 hours of cold (4 degrees C) storage in the Celsior preservation solution and 2 hours of reperfusion. Control hearts were immediately immersed after arrest. In the 3 treated groups, 2 customized thermal probes were first applied onto the left ventricular free wall of the explanted heart at 22 degrees C, 37 degrees C or 42.5 degrees C for 15 minutes before immersion. Each of the selected temperatures were monitored at the probe-tissue interface by a thermocouple. Whereas base line end-diastolic pressure was set at = 8 mm Hg in all groups, it increased during reperfusion (mean +/- SEM) to 28+/-3, 27+/-3, 17+/-1, and 18+/-2 mm Hg in control, 22 degrees C, 37 degrees C and 42.5 degrees C-heated hearts, respectively (37 degrees C and 42.5 degrees C: p < 0.05 versus controls and 22 degrees C). Slopes of pressure-volume curves featured similar patterns. Likewise, reperfusion dP/dT (mm Hg/s(-1)) was significantly lower in control and 22 degrees C hearts (1,119+/-114 and 1,076+/-125, respectively) than in those undergoing prestorage heating to 37 degrees C and 42.5 degrees C (1,545+/-109 and 1,719+/-111, p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 versus controls and 22 degrees C, respectively). Western blot analysis of LV samples did not demonstrate any upregulation of HSP 72 in either group. Conversely, the involvement of preconditioning was evidenced by the loss of protection in the 42.5 degrees C-heated hearts when, in 2 additional groups, the storage solution was supplemented with either the protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase inhibitors chelerythrine (5 micromol/L) and genistein (50 micromol/L) or the mitochondrial K(ATP) channel inhibitor 5-hydroxydecanoate (200 micromol/L).

In patients with acute profound cardiogenic circulatory failure unresponsive to conventional resuscitation, we instituted immediate aggressive application of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to restore circulatory stability. Long-term hemodynamic support was accomplished with an early \"bridge\" to ventricular assist device (VAD) before definitive treatment with cardiac transplantation. A respective review of ECMO and VAD data registries was instituted. From May 1996 to July 2000, 23 patients were placed on ECMO support for profound cardiogenic circulatory failure. Eleven patients (47%) were withdrawn from support due to severe neurologic injury or multisystem organ failure. Three patients (13%) were weaned off ECMO with good outcome. Nine patients (39%) were transferred to a VAD. Two patients expired while on VAD support, and 7 of the VAD-supported patients (78%) survived to transplantation. Overall survival was 43%. Emergent ECMO support is a salvage approach for cardiac resuscitation once conventional measures have failed. In neurologically intact patients, the early transfer to a VAD quickly stabilizes hemodynamics, avoids complications, and is essential for long-term circulatory support before definitive treatment with cardiac transplantation.

The activation of T cells by B7 costimulation in trans has been demonstrated in vitro, but the in vivo relevance is unknown. To study costimulation in trans of CD4(+) T cells in vivo, we performed cardiac transplants from B7-1/B7-2-deficient mice to recipients that do not express MHC class II molecules on peripheral APCs, but do have functional CD4(+) T cells (II(-)/4(+) mice). This model restricts the B7-dependent activation of CD4(+) T cells to costimulation in trans and excludes any contribution from indirect Ag presentation. We find that II(-)/4(+) recipients reject B7-deficient grafts as rapidly as wild-type grafts, suggesting that costimulation in trans can mediate rejection as potently as costimulation in cis. Treatment of II(-)/4(+) recipients of B7-deficient grafts with depleting Abs to CD4 or CD8 demonstrates that indirect Ag presentation to CD8(+) cells does not significantly contribute to rejection. This is the first demonstration that costimulation in trans can mediate an immune response in vivo and has important therapeutic implications.

Leptin, the protein product of the ob gene, has been linked to a faster heart rate in animal and human studies. The interaction between leptin and heart rate in the denervated heart is not known. Therefore, we studied the relationship between plasma leptin levels and heart rate in heart transplant recipients. We studied 32 male patients (mean age, 56.5+/-9.3 years; range, 41 to 74 years) after orthotopic heart transplantation. All subjects underwent a physical examination, anthropometric measurements, blood chemistry analysis, and office blood pressure measurements. A blood sample was collected from each subject while fasting. In univariate analysis, heart rate was related to leptin levels (r=0.47, P=0.007) but heart rate was not related to systolic or diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, body mass index, or catecholamines. Leptin levels were only strongly associated with heart rate and body mass index (r=0.73, P<0.0001). In multivariate analysis, heart rate was independently and positively associated with leptin levels (F=2.61, P=0.017). We also observed a strong, independent association between leptin levels and body mass index (F=5.8, P<0.00001). We show an independent association between leptin levels and heart rate in heart transplant recipients. We speculate that this may be due, in part, to a direct effect of leptin on heart rate, conceivably mediated through cardiac leptin receptors.

Up to 40% of children and adolescents with chronic illness experience school-related problems, including learning difficulties and problems in social adjustment and peer relationships. Despite the life-threatening nature of heart and heart-lung transplantation and the severity of illness, which results in the necessity for surgery, there is little information on the school performance of children after transplantation. Eighty-one children and adolescents were assessed with regard to their academic attainments and behavior at school at regular intervals after heart (n=47) or heart-lung (n=34) transplantation and comparisons made with a group of healthy children. Cognitive ability and performance on academic attainments were within the normal range and did not change significantly as a function of time since transplant. However, performance was at a significantly lower level than that of the healthy children. Although the prevalence of behavior problems was only 8% at 6 months posttransplant, at 3 years, it had increased to 29% and, at 5 years, it was still 27%. Children with an initial diagnosis of congenital heart disease had more academic and behavioral difficulties than those with either cardiomyopathy or cystic fibrosis. A significant number of children who had undergone successful transplantation experienced difficulties at school. Contrary to expectations, educational problems were more prevalent in the medium term, rather than short term, after transplant. Initial diagnosis was a salient factor in posttransplant psychological functioning at school. Early intervention and close liaison with schools is indicated to reduce psychological morbidity and enhance adaptation within the school environment.

The acceptance of skin allografts has historically been among the most challenging problems in the field of transplantation, attributed, at least in part, to the existence of antigens expressed by skin but not by other tissues. Many studies have suggested the existence of skin-specific antigens in rodents, but data in large-animal models are more limited. We have recently developed protocols for attaining stable mixed hematopoietic chimerism in miniature swine, using MHC-matched donors and recipients. We have now assessed tolerance to donor-derived skin and cardiac allografts in these chimeric animals. Skin-graft rejection was seen in four of six animals receiving skin grafts taken from the respective hematopoietic donors. In the other two animals, donor-derived skin grafts survived indefinitely. No cardiac-allograft rejection was observed in mixed-chimeric animals that received heart transplants from their hematopoietic donors, even in animals that had already rejected skin allografts from the same donors. In all animals assessed, in vitro hyporesponsiveness to donor hematopoietic cells persisted. These findings support the concept that skin expresses immunogenic alloantigens that either are not expressed or are not immunogenic in cardiac or hematopoietic tissue.

FTY720 lowers the peripheral lymphocyte count (PLC) by accelerating the migration of circulating lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs. We investigated the efficacy of combined FTY720+cyclosporine (CsA) treatment versus monotherapy on prolonging graft survival and on lowering the PLC. BALB/c hearts were heterotopically grafted in C3H mice. FTY720 was administered alone or in combination with CsA. PLC and body weight were determined on day 7, day 28, or the day of rejection. Combining FTY720 with CsA prolonged, dose-dependently and significantly, the allograft survival. FTY720, but not CsA, lowered the PLC dose-dependently. The granulocyte count was not reduced in any group. FTY720 concentrations were not influenced by the CsA co-administration. Combined FTY720 and CsA treatment was well tolerated, promoted graft survival, and suppressed the inflammatory allo-response. The PLC lowering correlated well with the antirejection effects in the two-drug regimens, suggesting that the PLC might guide FTY720 therapy at low doses.

Gap junction channels formed by the connexin43 protein are considered to play crucial roles in development and function because they allow the direct cell-to-cell exchange of molecules that mediate multiple signaling events. Previous results have shown that connexin43 channels are intricately gated by phosphorylation and that disruption of this regulation gives rise to severe heart malformations and defects of laterality in human, chick and frog. Here we report the identification of connexin43 gene mutations that represent a minor population of connexin43 alleles, which could be reliably detected by using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to visualize normal and mutant DNAs that were separately sequenced. In contrast, sequencing of total PCR products without DGGE-pre-selection failed to consistently identify these mutations. Forty-six controls and 20 heart transplant recipients were examined in this study. In the latter group, 14 children had hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) in which connexin43 gene defects were detected in eight. The remaining six transplant patients with HLHS and all controls showed no defects. All eight HLHS children with gene defects had the same four substitutions: two that were silent polymorphisms, and two that were missense, replacing arginine codons at positions 362 and 376 with codons for glutamines. All four of these substitutions are identical to the nucleotide sequence of the connexin43 pseudogene, suggesting the possibility of an illicit recombination. A breakpoint region was identified 5' to the mutation site in a 63bp domain that is 100% identical in the gene and pseudogene. Results from in vitro phosphorylation indicate that the absence of arginines 362 and 376 completely abolishes phosphorylation in the connexin43 channel regulation domain suggesting a possible mechanism for the pathologies associated with HLHS.

The occurrence of right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary arterial hypertension is a major postoperative complication of cardiac surgery in children and adults. The selective pulmonary vasodilation produced by inhaled nitric oxide (NO) constitutes a fundamental therapeutic advance in the management of this pathology. NO binds immediately with haemoglobin, resulting in its immediate inactivation. This results in perfect maintenance of systemic and coronary blood pressures. A first study performed in 1989 after mitral valve replacement for mitral stenosis with pulmonary hypertension and clinical trials after surgical correction for congenital heart disease and heart transplantation with pulmonary hypertension suggested the efficacy and safety of 20 to 40 ppm NO concentrations in these indications. Potential toxicity of NO (NO2 production by oxidation, methaemoglobin formation) leads to caution with its use.

A total of 104 patients had 113 episodes of Afl; 102 patients had 117 episodes of AF. The incidence of Afl (12.7%) was the same as AF (13.1%). Sixty-nine AF episodes occurred in first 2 weeks after transplantation, and 22 of which were associated with rejection. In contrast, only 20 Afl episodes occurred the first 2 weeks after OHT, 10 of which were associated with rejection. Fifty-two episodes of Afl occurred during from the third week to 6 months after transplantation, 34 of which were associated with moderate to severe cellular or humoral rejection and/or transplant coronary artery disease (TCAD). All 41 Afl episodes that occurred 6 months after transplantation were associated with cellular and humoral rejection, and/or TCAD. The prevalence of Afl was significantly higher in biatrial than bicaval anastomosis. Atrial conduction defect, manifested by the increase of terminal force of the P wave in lead V(1) of the surface electrocardiogram, predicted the occurrence of Afl and AF associated with rejection in OHT with a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 92%.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) complicates 5--10% of heart and heart--lung transplant patients. We report our experience of peritoneal dialysis (PD) in 17 such patients. Between March 1995 and February 1999, 13 heart transplant and four heart--lung transplant patients (11 male, 6 female) joined our PD programme (10 continuous ambulatory PD, seven automated PD). Median time from heart or heart--lung transplantation to ESRD was 9 years (range 1--13 years), and median age at introduction of renal replacement therapy was 51 years (range 23--66 years). The frequency of exit-site infections, peritonitis, and PD survival (including technique failure and death) in the transplant group (TxP) was calculated retrospectively. These were compared with two contemporary control groups: PD patients immunosuppressed for other indications (ISP, n=19) and, all other patients recruited onto the PD programme (NISP, n=132). Median follow-up was 10 months (range 2--27 months) for TxP, 7 months (range 2--29 months) for ISP, and 14 months (range 1--48 months) for NISP groups. The frequency of exit-site infections was similar in each group: 1 in 26 months for TxP; 1 in 30 months for ISP, and 1 in 27 months for NISP (P=NS). The frequency of peritonitis was greater in the TxP group at 1 in 15 months, compared with 1 in 20 months for ISP and 1 in 29 months for NISP (TxP vs NISP, P<0.05).

We have previously demonstrated in vitro that proteasome inhibitors could suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis of activated T cells. This finding suggests that such inhibitors could be used as a novel category of immunosuppressants in blocking allograft rejection. The proteasome inhibitor dipeptide boronic acid (DPBA) was tested in vitro for its inhibitory effect on mouse T-cell proliferation and lymphokine secretion. DPBA was also used in vivo to treat mouse heterotopic heart allograft rejection. Possible side effects of this compound were examined according to blood chemistry of mice treated with DPBA. DPBA suppressed the T-cell proliferation and potently inhibited interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-gamma produced by anti-CD3-activated T cells. Given i.p. starting 1 day after transplantation at 0.66 mg/kg per day for 16 days, or at 1 mg/kg per day for 4 days followed by 0.5 mg/kg per day for 12 days, DPBA could prolong heart allograft survival to 35.5 days (mean survival time, MST) and to 36.2 days, respectively.
