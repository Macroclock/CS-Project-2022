Stroke rehabilitation and the cardiac transplantation patient. A paucity of information exists concerning the mechanism and occurrence rate of stroke associated with cardiac transplantation. Furthermore, the rehabilitation of such patients has not been elaborated on. This report explores these issues and reviews the medical history and rehabilitation progress of four individuals who suffered a stroke before, or associated with, the transplantation process. Physiologic factors relevant to the rehabilitation of the post-heart transplantation stroke patient will also be discussed.
