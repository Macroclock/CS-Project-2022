Management of hand and upper-extremity infections in heart transplant recipients. Hand and upper-extremity infections are routinely managed by antibiotics, immobilization, and limited incision and drainage. However, in immunocompromised patients, these infections may be more aggressive and they may require more emergent treatment. The authors performed a retrospective review of the Stanford University Medical Center experience with hand and upper-extremity infections in 911 cardiac transplant recipients over the past 30 years. Thirteen heart transplant recipients were treated for infections of the hand and upper extremity on an inpatient basis. Ten patients (77 percent) required operative debridement, and three (23 percent) required more than one operative procedure. Nine patients (69 percent) had bacterial infections, six (46 percent) had fungal infections [four of these patients (31 percent) had both bacterial and fungal infections], one (7.7 percent) had a mycobacterial infection, and one (7.7 percent) was not cultured. Hand and upper-extremity infections in transplant recipients frequently resulted in deep-space infections, tenosynovitis, and osteomyelitis. The authors believe such infections represent a surgical emergency, requiring immediate evaluation by hand surgeons and early, aggressive treatment.
