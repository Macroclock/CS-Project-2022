Protective effect of short-tem calcitriol or cyclical etidronate on bone loss after cardiac or lung transplantation. Bone loss is most rapid in the immediate period after cardiac or lung transplantation. This randomized study compared the efficacy of 6 months of treatment with either calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; 0.5 microg/day) or two cycles of etidronate plus calcium in preventing bone loss in 41 patients undergoing cardiac or lung transplantation. Patients were followed for 18 months after cessation of treatment. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). There were no significant differences between groups with respect to age or cumulative dose of prednis(ol)one or cyclosporin over the 2 years. Bone loss did not differ between groups after 6 months and, despite 6 months prophylaxis with either agent, bone loss was significant in both groups at 6 months and 12 months. However, compared with an untreated reference group, both therapies offered significant protection at 6 months and etidronate provided significant protective carryover after therapy had been discontinued. These data suggest short-term prophylaxis with calcitriol or cyclical etidronate is partially effective in reducing bone loss after cardiac or lung transplantation but treatment needs to be continued for a longer term.
