Aerosolized iloprost for severe pulmonary hypertension as a bridge to heart transplantation. Preexisting pulmonary hypertension in pediatric patients is associated with poor outcome after cardiac transplantation because of donor right ventricular dysfunction. To avoid a combined heart-lung transplantation in a 17-year-old patient, we used an intensified pretreatment with intravenous prostacyclin and dobutamine combined with an inhalative therapy with the aerosolized prostacyclin-analog Iloprost. With this regimen, the patient was hemodynamically stabilized for the waiting period of 21 days after which an uneventful cardiac transplantation was performed.
