Cardiac transplantation in a patient with hereditary hemochromatosis: role of adjunctive phlebotomy and erythropoietin. We describe the case of a 36-year-old woman with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) resulting in end-stage cardiomyopathy and treated successfully with orthotopic cardiac transplantation. Before and after transplantation, the patient underwent aggressive treatment with frequent phlebotomy. We used erythropoietin concomitantly to maintain adequate hematocrit to support continued phlebotomy. We believe that aggressive use of phlebotomy provided the patient hemodynamic benefit and hastened the return of endocrine function post-transplantation. We also believe that the patient's history of high-dose vitamin C usage may have accelerated iron deposition in the heart and other vital organs.
