Short-term bridge to transplant using the BVS 5000 in a 22-kg child. The availability of pulsatile mechanical assist devices for bridge to transplant in pediatric patients is limited owing to the patients' small sizes. Pulsatile devices offer potential advantages over nonpulsatile devices but the risk of hypertensive bleeding must be balanced against that of device thrombosis. We describe our experience using the BVS 5000 external pulsatile device in an 8-year old patient with a body surface area of 0.88 m2.
