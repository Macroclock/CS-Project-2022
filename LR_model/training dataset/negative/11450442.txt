[Liver mitochondria in antigenic stress in rats]. The penomenon of reciprocal regulation of succinate dehidrogenase activity in rat liver mitochondria was elicited in antigenic strain induced by the administration of activated lymphocytes from animals with allotransplated heart. Two coupled but opposite changes (simultaneous activation and inhibition) in succinate depended ATP synthesis and calcium transport occur. The inhibition was correlated with the activation of synthetic processes in hepatocytes. Similar changes were provoked by epinephrine (either administered i.p. or released endogenously under immobilization stress and in myocardium infarction) as well as in patients with stomach tumor. The physiological significance of the reciprocal regulation of succinate dehydrogenase is discussed.
