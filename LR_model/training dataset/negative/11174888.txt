Treatment of advanced heart failure. The incidence of chronic heart failure has increased, with a corresponding increase in morbidity and mortality, and has made a substantial financial impact on our society. Improved therapy for heart failure has resulted in a significant prolongation of survival, a decreased number of hospitalizations, and an enhanced quality of life for many patients. It can reasonably be expected, therefore, that adherence to a rational medical regimen for these patients might decrease costs as well. Management of patients with severe heart failure begins with identifying the etiology and educating the patients and their families. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the cornerstone of therapy but only after diagnostic tests are performed to establish the etiology and extent of myocardial dysfunction. Because cardiac transplantation is a therapeutic option for only a limited number of patients, other surgical and medical therapies have to be viewed as the mainstay of a treatment strategy.
