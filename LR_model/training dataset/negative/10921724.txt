Successful weaning of a transplanted heart from biventricular assist device. Exceptionally few cases worldwide have survived weaning from a biventricular assist device following heart transplantation in contrast to those who underwent early retransplantation. We present a successful outcome after biventricular assist device implantation following initial biventricular failure after heart transplantation. Weaning could be performed after 1 week, although pulmonary vascular resistance remained markedly elevated.
