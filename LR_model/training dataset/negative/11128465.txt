Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair in cardiac transplant recipients. We present here two cases of asymptomatic thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms that were successfully operated on in heart transplant patients 8 and 23 months after transplantation. Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm was present prior to transplantation in one patient. In the other patient only the abdominal aortic aneurysm was found before transplantation. Indications for transplantation were ischemic and valvular cardiomyopathy. Surgical aortic aneurysm repair was performed with the standard technique. Both patients were discharged from the hospital. The possible contributing factors to the development and enlargement of aortic aneurysms and perioperative assessment are also discussed. Radiologic surveillance is warranted in any heart transplant recipient with abdominal or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms because of the more rapid aneurysm expansion.
