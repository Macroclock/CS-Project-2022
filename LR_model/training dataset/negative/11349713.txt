Differential NF-kappaB and IkappaB gene expression during development of cardiac allograft rejection versus CD154 monoclonal antibody-induced tolerance. The Rel/NF-kappaB transcription factor pathway, regulated by IkappaB proteins, is considered central to immune responses, although there are surprisingly few in vivo data concerning alloresponses. We undertook analysis of NF-kappaB and IkappaB mRNA intracardiac allograft expression, and NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, during acute rejection versus CD154 monoclonal antibody (mAb)-induced tolerance induction in fully MHC-disparate mice. Intragraft expression of all nine NF-kappaB and IkappaB genes increased during development of rejection, and nuclear translocation of p50, p52, and p65 was detected. CD154 mAb therapy decreased mRNA levels of all nine NF-kappaB and IkappaB genes, and impaired nuclear translocation of p50, p52, and p65 NF-kappaB proteins. However, prolonged survival could not be induced by CD154 mAb in p50- or p52-deficient allograft recipients, indicating an absolute requirement for expression of these genes in CD154 mAb-induced tolerance. We conclude that, whereas blanket approaches to NF-kappaB suppression are unlikely to be effective strategies for tolerance induction, a better understanding of the roles of individual NF-kappaB and IkappaB genes may allow development of more precise and effective therapies.
