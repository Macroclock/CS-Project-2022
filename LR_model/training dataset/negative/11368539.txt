Organ transplant specificity of tolerance to skin grafts with heart or kidney grafts plus nondepleting anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (RIB 5/2) and intravenous donor alloantigen administration. CD4+ T cells play an essential role in allograft rejection. Monoclonal anti-rat CD4 antibody, RIB 5/2, has been shown to modulate the CD4 glycoprotein without eliminating recipient T cells. A single dose of monoclonal anti-rat CD4 antibody RIB 5/2 plus donor splenocytes results in donor-specific unresponsiveness to heart and kidney allografts, but not skin allografts. This study examined whether tolerance to the more resistant skin graft could also be achieved with RIB 5/2. Buffalo (RT1(b)) recipients were given a single dose (20 mg/kg) of monoclonal antibody RIB 5/2 IP plus IV Lewis (RT1(l)) splenocytes (25 x 10(6)) 21 days before Lewis heart, kidney, or skin grafts. In addition, Lewis skin was grafted either simultaneously with or after long- term Lewis heart or kidney allograft acceptance (>50 days). While IV alloantigen plus RIB 5/2 results in long-term acceptance of both heart and kidney, skin allografts are rejected when transplanted alone. Simultaneous transplantation with a Lewis kidney, but not with a Lewis heart, resulted in long-term Lewis skin graft acceptance. However, recipients tolerant to Lewis kidney or heart alone will not accept subsequent Lewis skin grafts, while recipients of simultaneous Lewis skin and kidney grafts subsequently accept a second Lewis, but not third-party Brown Norway (RT1(n)), skin graft. RIB 5/2 plus Lewis donor splenocytes tolerize for donor-specific heart and kidney but not skin grafts. However, Lewis skin grafted simultaneously with a Lewis kidney, but not Lewis heart, is accepted and protects a subsequent donor-specific Lewis skin graft.
