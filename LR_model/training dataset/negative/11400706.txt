Recurrent Epstein-Barr virus associated disease in a cardiac transplant patient: evolution from plasmacytic hyperplasia to diffuse large cell lymphoma. An Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-seronegative 31-year-old male underwent cardiac transplantation in 1991 for congenital cardiomyopathy. He presented with a protracted course of waxing and waning lymphadenopathy beginning four years after transplantation with eventual progression to a fulminant EBV-positive large cell lymphoma eight years after transplantation. Risk factors for the development of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease in this patient, the importance of a standardized approach to pathology in assessing therapeutic options, and the management strategies used are discussed.
