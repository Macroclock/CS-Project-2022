Lack of effects of recombinant human growth hormone in a child with a complex cardiovascular malformation and dilated cardiomyopathy. Recent studies have suggested the beneficial effects of GH treatment in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. We have treated with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) a 6-year-old female with a complex congenital heart defect (severe tricuspid hypoplasia and malposition of the great arteries), who developed a progressive dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology. rhGH treatment (0,1 U/kg/day, for 3 months) did not improve cardiac function, nor clinical symptoms, although we have no clear explanations for this. However, a trial with rhGH may be offered to children with dilated cardiomyopathy and waiting for heart transplantation.
