Efficiency of organ procurement and transplantation programs. The number of donations per million population (pmp) per year and the number of transplants pmp/year enables one to compare donation or transplant programs made in different years in the same area or made the same year in different areas. These pmp indexes may be integrated with an evaluation system by which each organ is evaluated separately in terms of the efficiency of its procurement and transplant systems using the procurement index (percentage in terms of number of organs utilized/number of organs procurable from donors utilized in a single area during 1 year) and the transplant index (percentage in terms of number of transplants performed/number of organs harvested in a single area during 1 year). We have called them Caldes I (procurement) and Caldes II (transplant) indexes. The harvest index evaluates the efficiency of utilization of organs retrieved from suitable donors. It usually ranges between 80-90% for the kidney, 70-95% for the liver, 40-50% for the heart, and 5-15% for the lungs. The transplant index evaluates for each organ the transplant team capacity to use available organs which can be harvested locally or in different areas. It usually ranges between 60-120%. Index determination did not require information different from the standard data available. Both the harvest and transplant indexes could be used to compare the efficiency of donation and transplant programs and policies in the same area during different years or at the same time in different areas. They can be critical in evaluating: (a) marginal donor utilization, (b) marginal organ utilization, and (c) dishomogeneity of organ retrieval and organ transplantation in different regions belonging to the same area. They also enable to evaluate if organs considered not available in a single area are offered to other areas or are not retrieved at all from available donors.
