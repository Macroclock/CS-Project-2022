Orthotopic heart transplantation with concurrent aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting. We report a case of successful orthotopic heart transplantation of a donor heart with normal ventricular function, 2-vessel coronary artery disease, and a bicuspid aortic valve, which required concurrent aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting. In confronting the disparities in demand and supply, we must consider the so-called marginally acceptable heart for either critically ill recipients or those who may be disadvantaged on the waiting list.
