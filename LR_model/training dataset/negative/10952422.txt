Surgical therapies for heart failure. Heart transplantation remains the best hope for patients with end-stage heart failure unresponsive to conventional therapy, but the number of transplant candidates continues to exceed the number of available donor hearts. Despite major advances in the medical management of heart failure, researchers continue to explore alternative surgical therapies designed to augment cardiac function. Many of these surgical therapies are still in the experimental or clinical trial phases. Surgical approaches include coronary revascularization, mitral valve repair or replacement, cardiomyoplasty, left ventricular volume reduction surgery, and bridging to recovery with the use of ventricular assist devices. Although cardiac surgeons have gained considerable experience in the treatment of patients with heart failure, many improvements and innovations lie ahead.
