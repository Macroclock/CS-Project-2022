Hemolytic and uremic syndrome after heart transplantation. Two cases of hemolytic and uremic syndrome in heart transplant recipients are reported. Among solid organ transplantations, this complication mainly occurred in renal transplantation and only 1 case was reported in heart transplantation in the literature. Cyclosporine was the only etiologic factor found. The renal outcome was severe with end-stage renal failure and no recovery of the renal function despite stopping cyclosporine, corticoids and plasma exchange.
