Detection of T suppressor cells in patients with organ allografts. Specific immunosuppression of host's immune response to donor HLA antigens has been a major goal to clinical transplantation. Recent evidence has been accumulating to show that a distinct population of T cells expressing the CD8(+) CD28(-) phenotype display suppressor function and inhibit Th activation and proliferation by modulating the APC function. To assess the presence of Ts in transplant recipient's circulation, we have developed a flow cytometry method that measures the expression of costimulatory molecules on donor APC exposed to recipient Th and Ts. Our results demonstrate that quantitation of the capacity of CD8(+) CD28(-) T cells from patient circulation to suppress the activation of costimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86) on donor APC offers a reliable tool for monitoring specific immunosuppression against the graft in solid organ transplantation.
