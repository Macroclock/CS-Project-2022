Optimization of ex vivo pressure mediated delivery of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to ICAM-1 reduces reperfusion injury in rat cardiac allografts. Our purpose was to optimize hyperbaric pressure as a vector for ex vivo transfection of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODN) to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 to limit reperfusion injury (RI) in cardiac allografts. We investigated the effects of increased pressure, incubation time, and AS-ODN concentrations on transfection efficiency and toxicity. PVG (RT1c) donor hearts were heterotopically transplanted to ACI (RT1a) recipients. Donor hearts were harvested and the various groups were treated at: (1) different pressure (1-9 atm) for 45 min with 80 micromol/liter AS-ODN; (2) different incubation times (15 min to 6 hr) at 5 atm with 80 micromol/liter AS-ODN; 3) different AS-ODN concentrations (80-240 micromol/liter) at 5 atm for 45 min. Hearts were procured 24 or 72 hr after transplantation. Transfection efficiency was determined with fluorescein-labeled AS-ODN. The degree of RI was determined with biochemical and histological analysis. Increasing pressure from ambient (1 atm) pressure to pressures as high as 9 atm leads to a increase in transfection efficiency from 1.7+/-.5 to 62+/-3.9% and a reduction in RI. Increased incubation time up to 45 min increased transfection efficiency and reduced RI, but longer incubation times induced significant toxicity to the allograft. Increased AS-ODN concentrations improved transfection and reduced RI. Hyperbaric pressure is a safe and effective vector for the ex vivo delivery of AS-ICAM-1-ODN to rodent cardiac allografts and results in a reduction in reperfusion injury.
