Early post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease following heart transplantation in the absence of lymphocytolytic induction therapy. We report a case of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease presenting as a disseminated polymorphous B-cell lymphoma involving the cardiac allograft 3 months following transplantation in a recipient who did not receive anti-lymphocyte induction immunosuppression. In situ hybridization for the lytic Epstein-Barr virus marker NOT I was positive within a lymphocytic infiltrate on endomyocardial biopsy. Our case is the third of early post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (within 6 months of transplantation) involving the heart allograft in the absence of anti-lymphocyte induction immunosuppression. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease of the heart allograft should be considered in the presence of an atypical cardiac lymphocytic infiltrate, with possible differentiation from allograft rejection using in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus.
