Selection and management of ventricular assist device patients: the Muenster experience. Because of the growing discrepancy between the availability of donor organs and the number of patients with end-stage heart disease who need heart transplantation, a larger proportion of patients waiting for a suitable donor heart require pre-operative mechanical circulatory assistance. The criteria for the selection and management of these patients as applied at Muenster University Hospital are reviewed. The study population consists of 631 patients referred to our center for transplantation between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1996. Two hundred ninety-seven patients were listed for transplantation and 157 were transplanted. Of 41 patients who underwent implantation of a ventricular assist device (n = 34, Novacor; n = 6, TCI HeartMate; n = 1, Medos), 39 received the device as a bridge to transplantation and 2 as permanent support. For the purpose of the analysis, the study population was divided into 3 groups (elective bridging, urgent bridging, emergency bridging) and compared with heart transplant candidates who did not require mechanical circulatory assistance. Patients who underwent elective or urgent assist-device implantation were younger and had greater hemodynamic compromise than the remainder of patients waiting for heart transplantation, as suggested by a higher functional class and lower mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, serum sodium, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure. Survival of patients who electively underwent implantation of an assist device was better than that of patients who were stable on the waiting list and did not undergo heart transplantation during follow-up. This finding suggests that earlier implantation of assist devices may facilitate resolution of organ dysfunction before heart transplantation.
