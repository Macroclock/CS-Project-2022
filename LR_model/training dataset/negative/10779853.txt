Postpericardiotomy syndrome during intensive immunosuppression after cardiac transplantation. A 15-year-old man with end-stage heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy, underwent heart transplantation. In the second postoperative week, while being treated with monoclonal antibodies (OKT3), cyclosporine and azathioprine, he developed a postpericardiotomy syndrome and cardiac tamponade, which necessitated emergency pericardiocentesis. Corticosteroids, administered according to the immunosuppression protocol, resulted in the prompt subsidence of the syndrome. This is the first report of a large pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade due to a postpericardiotomy syndrome in an adult cardiac recipient.
