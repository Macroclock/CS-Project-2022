Cyclosporine metabolism in patients after kidney, bone marrow, heart-lung, and liver transplantation in the early and late posttransplant periods. Cyclosporine is used in the prevention of allograft rejection. Owing to its narrow therapeutic index, regular monitoring of the whole blood levels of cyclosporine is required. We observed that immunoassays measured significantly higher cyclosporine levels than did high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) over time after transplantation. As cyclosporine metabolites cross-react even with immunoassays, this observation might be due to alterations of the cyclosporine metabolism. We analyzed cyclosporine metabolite concentrations in the early and in the late posttransplantation periods in 127 patients after kidney, bone marrow, heart-lung, and liver transplantation by HPLC and determined whole blood levels of cyclosporine by 4 immunoassays (enzyme-multiplied immunoassay [EMIT], cloned enzyme donor immunoassay [CEDIA], AxSYM [Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL], and TDx [Abbott Laboratories]). Despite reduced dose, we found significantly higher cyclosporine concentrations measured by the EMIT, AxSYM, and TDx assays in various patient groups. These results are due to the increased metabolite/cyclosporine ratio in the late posttransplantation period. In particular, the metabolites AM1 and AM19 increased significantly over time in bone marrow transplant recipients. Therefore, cyclosporine levels measured by immunoassays should be interpreted with caution.
