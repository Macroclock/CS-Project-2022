Low-density lipoprotein apheresis in the treatment of atherosclerosis and other potential uses. This review concerns the clinical impact of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis for patients with refractory hypercholesterolemia. We examine and provide examples of investigations that have demonstrated the clinical benefits of LDL apheresis. In addition to benefits derived from the stabilization or regression of arterial lesions, we highlight other possible mechanisms related to clinical improvement. We also discuss the potential advantages of lipid apheresis for the treatment of patient populations other than those characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia and premature coronary heart disease.
