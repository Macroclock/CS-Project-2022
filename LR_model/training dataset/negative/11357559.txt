Alternative technique to cannulate the descending aorta for abdominal organ procurement in a hemodynamically unstable patient. During organ procurement, maintaining adequate organ perfusion is crucial. Hemodynamic instability may compromise organ viability and demand quick intervention, sometimes rapid, early cannulation of vessels, so that organs may be salvaged. In this case report of an unstable donor with large retroperitoneal hematoma, a surgical approach is presented that has previously not been described. The technique facilitated hemodynamic stability while allowing rapid cannulation of the retrocardiac descending aorta.
