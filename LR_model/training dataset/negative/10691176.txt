Heart transplantation: influence of the surgical technique on sinus function. This study analyzes the influence of the surgical technique on the development of sinus dysfunction. Cycle length, corrected sinus node recovery time, and sinoatrial conduction time were determined in 4 groups of dogs under the following conditions: group 1, controls; group 2, subjected to heterotopic heart transplantation with conservation of atrial anatomy; group 3, subjected to orthotopic heart transplantation by using a standard technique; and group 4, treated as in group 3, but with an ischemic time of 24 hours. The cycle length was prolonged in all the treated groups when compared with the controls (P < .01), an effect attributed to the disconnection of the autonomic nervous system during the transplantation procedure. The corrected sinus node recovery time and sinoatrial conduction time were significantly longer in all the animals in groups 3 and 4 when compared with those of groups 1 and 2 (P < .01); however, there were no significant differences between groups 3 and 4 or between groups 1 and 2. These results suggest that the atrial anatomy play a more relevant role than the ischemic time in the origin of sinus dysfunction occurring after orthotopic heart transplantation.
