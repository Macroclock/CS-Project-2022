Primary bronchogenic carcinoma after heart or lung transplantation: radiologic and clinical findings. Chronic immunosuppression in organ transplant recipients predisposes to the development of malignant disease. The authors describe their 29-year institutional experience of bronchogenic carcinoma developing after heart and lung transplantation. Seven cases of bronchogenic carcinoma were diagnosed in 1,119 heart and lung transplant recipients. Computed tomography scans and radiographs at time of diagnosis, as well as prior radiographs available in six patients were retrospectively analyzed by two radiologists in consensus. The seven cases involved six heart and one lung transplant recipients. Six patients were smokers with a mean smoking history of 66 pack-years. Mean time interval from transplantation to cancer detection was 25 months. Radiologic findings consisted of a solitary pulmonary nodule (n = 3), mass with satellite nodules (n = 1), and obstructive pneumonitis (n = 1). In the sixth patient, the cancer was not radiographically visible because of obscuration by adjacent fibrosis. On review, radiographic abnormalities were present a mean of 12 months prior to diagnosis in 66% of patients. In the heart or lung transplant population, bronchogenic carcinoma develops in recipients with extensive smoking histories. It presents radiographically as a nodule, mass, or obstructive pneumonitis, and is usually visible on radiographs before the time of diagnosis.
