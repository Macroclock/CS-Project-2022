Pseudoaneurysm after heart transplantation with history of LVAD driveline infection. An infective complication of the aorta is a potential cause of early and late mortality after heart transplantation. We report the case of a 21-year-old male cardiac transplant patient in whom a pseudoaneurysm of the recipient site of ascending aorta coincided with the site of the outflow prosthesis of a preexisting left ventricular assist device; this condition developed 9 months after transplantation.
