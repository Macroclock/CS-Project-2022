[HLA-G: fetomaternal tolerance]. HLA-G is a non-classical major histocompatibility complex class I molecule selectively expressed on cytotrophoblasts. We have demonstrated ex vivo (from voluntary pregnancy interruption samples) the protector role of the HLA-G molecule present on the surface of cytotrophoblast cells versus the lysis carried out by the decidual uterine NK cells. This occurs under semi-allogenic conditions (maternal uterine NK cells and their trophoblast counterparts), as well as in allogenic conditions (maternal uterine NK cells and trophoblast cells from different mothers), thus defining the absence of maternal rejection at the moment of the implantation of the fertilized egg during pregnancy. Moreover, the expression of HLA-G on the cytotrophoblasts permits migration in maternal circulation and infiltration of maternal tissue (particularly in the skin), thereby probably creating a general state of tolerance. In the context of heart transplantation, in preliminary studies, we show that the presence of HLA-G in cardiac biopsy tissue prelevated from grafted patients significantly reduces acute rejects and shows an absence of chronic rejects. In the tumour context, the expression of HLA-G protein at the surface of primitive melanoma and metastatic cells confers protection from NK and CTL lytic activity. This suggests that HLA-G expression may impede the elimination of malignant cells by anti-tumour immune effector cells, constituting a newly described mechanism by which tumour cells may evade immunosurveillance. From there on E.D. Carosella introduced the breakthrough concept of 'HLA a tolerance molecule' in the heart of histocompatibility antigens, which had been described up till then as antigenes of defence and rejection, and the dramatic role of HLA-G in immunotolerance.
