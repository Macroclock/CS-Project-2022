Cardiomyopathy in a carrier of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. During the third trimester of her pregnancy, a 25-year-old carrier of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy developed severe cardiac failure and required mechanical circulatory support and transplantation. Her cardiac function improved during 311 days of circulatory support. However this improvement was not sufficient to allow removal of her left ventricular assist device before transplantation.
