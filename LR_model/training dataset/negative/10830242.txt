Impact of chronic infection with chlamydia pneumoniae on incidence of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Chronic infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP) is associated with development of coronary disease. However, little information exists concerning CP infection and impact on posttransplant cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). A total of 202 patients were investigated 5.5+/-3.1 years after cardiac transplantation (46.5+/-11.0 years; 169 male, 33 female). Assessment of CAV was performed by annual coronary angiograms. Chlamydia serology (IgG/IgA) was performed using micro-immunofluorescence. Statistics comprised analysis of variance and Kaplan-Meier analysis. A total of 152 patients were CAV positive. Elevated titers were present in 45% (IgG) and 72.8% (IgA) of patients. Generally, serostatus was not associated with development of CAV when evaluated over the total postoperative interval. However, after month 14 there was a significant trend toward lower actuarial freedom from CAV in patients with elevated IgA titers. CP seems not to play a significant role in the development of CAV early after heart transplantation but might be a predicting risk factor after the first postoperative year.
