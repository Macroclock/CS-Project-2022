Magnetic resonance imaging angiography in patency evaluation of bronchial artery revascularization grafts. In this report we present our experience of non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MR) angiography and selective catheter angiography in assessing the patency of bronchial artery revascularization grafts after an en bloc double-lung and heart-lung transplantation. We studied 8 patients who had undergone pulmonary transplantation with direct bronchial artery revascularization. Catheter angiography was performed 10 days to 63 months postoperatively. MR angiography was performed within 24 h of the catheter procedure and the results were compared with the findings from catheter angiography. Catheter angiography showed the bronchial revascularization graft to be patent in 6 patients and occluded in 2. At MR angiography, the patency of bronchial artery revascularization grafts was reliably identified in 7 of the 8 patients. One patient had inadequate image quality because of void artefacts caused by haemostatic clips. It is concluded that MR angiography is a reliable method for assessing the patency of bronchial artery revascularization grafts.
