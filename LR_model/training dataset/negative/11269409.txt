Bridge to transplantation with a Thoratec left ventricular assist device in a 17-kg child. A Thoratec left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was used to support a 7-year-old 17-kg boy with viral cardiomyopathy for 23 days before heart transplantation. The boy is still living more than 1 year posttransplant, and functional except for some spastic paresis of the left hand, a residual from a stroke during device support. He is the smallest person to be supported with this device. We discuss techniques for using the Thoratec in children.
