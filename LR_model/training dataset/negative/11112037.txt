Are heart transplant recipients more likely to develop skin cancer than kidney transplant recipients? Non-melanoma skin cancer is frequent in organ transplant recipients. The risk of posttransplant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in Norwegian heart transplant recipients (n = 148) and kidney transplant recipients (n = 1020) on triple immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisolone, transplanted between 1983 and 1992, were studied. After adjustment for age at transplantation in multivariable Cox models, heart transplant recipients had a significantly 2.8-times higher risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma relative to kidney transplant recipients. The risk relative to the general population (standardized incidence ratio) was higher in heart transplant recipients than in kidney transplant recipients. The results indicate that heart transplant recipients are more likely to be diagnosed with skin cancer than kidney transplant recipients, probably due to the higher doses of cyclosporine and azathioprine after heart transplantation used at our center in the study period.
