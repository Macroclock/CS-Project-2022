Expression of allograft inflammatory factor-1 is a marker of activated human vascular smooth muscle cells and arterial injury. The cytokine-induced activation and proliferation of medial vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) leading to intimal hyperplasia is one of the most critical cellular events in the formation of transplant arteriopathy and balloon angioplasty-induced restenosis. Allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1) is a calcium-binding protein that we have previously shown to be expressed in balloon angioplasty-injured rat carotid arteries. We hypothesized that AIF-1 expression may be associated with the VSMC response to injury. In this study, we examined AIF-1 expression in immunologic and mechanical models of arterial injury. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western analysis demonstrated that AIF-1 is acutely and transiently expressed in aortic medial smooth muscle cells of rat cardiac allografts, with mRNA and protein peaking at 3 to 7 days after transplant and declining by 10 days after transplant. Immunohistochemical analysis identified abundant AIF-1 in the medial VSMCs of these vessels. Immunohistochemical analysis of balloon angioplasty-injured swine coronary arteries also demonstrates an acute AIF-1 expression detectable by 24 hours and continuing up to 14 days after the procedure. AIF-1 in these vessels also localizes to the medial VSMCs and cells of the developing neointima. AIF-1 protein is not expressed in quiescent cultured human VSMCs but is induced in cells challenged with various inflammatory cytokines, primarily by interferon-gamma, interleukin-1beta, and T-cell-conditioned media. Transfection and overexpression of AIF-1 in human VSMCs result in enhanced growth of these cells. Taken together, these data indicate that AIF-1 expression is associated with vascular trauma and suggest that this protein may play a role in VSMC activation subsequent to arterial injury.
