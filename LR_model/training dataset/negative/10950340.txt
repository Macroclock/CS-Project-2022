Fetal echocardiographic features of twisted atrioventricular connections. We present an example of corrected transposition with twisted discordant atrioventricular connections in which both fetal and postnatal echocardiograms were obtained. We correlate the fetal echocardiograms with the postnatal echocardiograms, placing emphasis on the echocardiographic clues to the diagnosis which were present in fetal life. The diagnosis should be suspected when the cardiac chambers and great arteries show an unexpected spatial relationship for the given segmental connections, and when the axes of opening of the atrioventricular valves are not parallel.
