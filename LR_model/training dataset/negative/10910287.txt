Prolonged survival of heart allografts from p53-deficient mice. Acute rejection of the heart allograft is the major cause of heart failure in the first month after transplantation. Most studies on the prevention of acute rejection have concentrated on immune suppression of the recipients, whereas little is known about the effects of genetically manipulated donor organs on heart allograft survival. Herein, we describe a mouse model of heart allografts donated by p53-/- mice that can prolong the survival time of the grafts. Hearts of p53-/- or p53+/+ C57BL/6J mice were grafted to the neck carotid artery and jugular vein of BALB/c mice using a cuff technique. The graft survival was observed daily. The hearts were analyzed using several techniques, including histology, immunofluorescence, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL), and Western blot analysis. p53+/+ allografts ceased beating at 7.6+/-0.5 days, whereas p53-/- hearts were beating at 10.5+/-1.1 days after transplantation (P<0.01). Mean histological rejection scores were significantly lower in allografts donated by p53-deficient mice. Furthermore, apoptotic cells, determined by TUNEL and a reagent kit for detection of cardiac apoptosis, were of high numbers in the allograft sections from wild-type hearts but rare in p53-/- allografts (4.2+/-1.3 vs. 0.7+/-0.5/250x field). Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis revealed that high levels of p53 and proapoptotic protein Bax were expressed in wild-type grafts but not p53-/- allografts. Interestingly, Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein, was abundant in cardiac allografts from p53-/- mice and almost undetectable in grafts from wild-type mice. Thus, p53 is involved in cardiac apoptosis induced by alloimmune reaction, and prolonged survival of heart allografts can be achieved when p53 is lacking.
