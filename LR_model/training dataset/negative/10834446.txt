Successful launch of cardiac transplantation in Japan. Osaka University Cardiac Transplant Program. Cardiac transplantation has been established as a therapeutic strategy for patients with end-stage heart failure. In Japan, however, cardiac transplantation has not been performed since the first case in 1968, and even now, after legislation for the approval of brain death was passed in 1997, it is still not performed regularly. Following long and steady efforts to enlighten Japanese society about the concept of brain death and the importance of organ transplantation, the first cardiac transplantation under the new legislation was successfully performed at Osaka University Hospital on February 1999. The patient was 47-year-old male in the dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who had been supported with an implantable left ventricular assist device. This article briefly reviews the situation prior to the first case of cardiac transplantation under the new legislation and discusses the current status of the therapy in Japan.
