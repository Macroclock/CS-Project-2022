Midterm follow-up of patients discharged from hospital under left ventricular assistance. Against the background of increasing demand for long-term mechanical circulatory support, discharging patients to their homes while on assist devices becomes more and more important. This report describes the midterm follow-up of 66 patients who were allowed to leave the hospital under left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support with Novacor or HeartMate systems. Between May 1994 and January 2000, 66 patients (9 women, 57 men, between 15 and 68 years old) under LVAD support fulfilled our criteria for being discharged home on the device. Intent to treat comprised bridging to transplantation in 59 patients, bridging to recovery in 5 patients, and alternative to transplantation in 2 patients. Forty-four patients received support with Novacor, 18 patients with the VE HeartMate, 2 patients with centrifugal pumps and Novacor, and 1 patient each with Novacor and Thoratec/Medos HIA-VAD. The mean out-of-hospital (OOH) follow-up period was 162 +/- 187 days, with a cumulative OOH experience of 30 patient years. Twenty-nine patients were not readmitted, and 37 patients were readmitted 54 times (23 patients were readmitted once, 11 patients twice, and 3 patients 3 times). The primary reasons for readmission included neurologic disorders and infection complications. At 229 days, 50% of all patients were free from readmission. The readmission rate was 1.8 patient/year. Sixteen patients died while on LVAD support (24%). Our midterm follow-up results show the safety and efficacy of this therapeutic option. Acceptable hospital readmission rates strongly support the future use of this technology as an alternative to transplantation in managing end-stage heart failure patients.
