Right ventricular dysplasia in an asymptomatic young man: an uncommon case with biventricular involvement and no known family history. A 33-year-old man had cardiomegaly on a routine x-ray examination. He was asymptomatic with no history of infarction, syncope, or palpitations. There was no family history of congenital heart disease or sudden death. Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated marked enlargement of the right atrium and ventricle with severely depressed right and left ventricular function that was consistent with right ventricular dysplasia. The patient was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and did well for 6 months, but then developed symptomatic left-sided congestive heart failure. Short-term improvement was obtained with intravenous inotropic therapy, but he continued to have progressive symptoms of heart failure. Approximately 7 months after his initial presentation, the patient underwent orthotopic heart transplantation for intractable congestive heart failure. Pathologic examination of the explanted heart established the diagnosis of right ventricular dysplasia with left ventricular involvement. This is an uncommon presentation of right ventricular dysplasia with biventricular involvement and no known family history.
