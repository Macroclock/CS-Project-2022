Genetic variations of the apolipoprotein E gene determine the plasma triglyceride levels after heart transplantation. To study whether the presence of the polymorphism in the apolipoprotein E (apo E) gene influences the lipid profile in heart-transplant recipients. A cohort of 103 recipients of heart transplant (93 men and 10 women, with a mean age of 47 +/- 13 years) under triple immunosuppressive therapy were submitted to a genetic study of the apo E gene region. Anthropometric and analytical data, including lipid profile and arterial blood pressure were collected prior to transplantation and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after it. 65 subjects present the genotype E3E3, 27 the genotype E3E4, 6 the genotype E2E3, and 5 the genotype E2E4. Carriers of the E2 allele (that is, genotypes E3E2 and E4E2) had higher total plasma triglyceride (TG) levels after 3 months (3.47 +/- 1.88 mmol/liter p < 0.001) and after 1 year of transplantation (3.13 +/- 1.77 mmol/liter p < 0.05) than the other genotypes. There were no differences in the plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the apoprotein E gene polymorphism determines 5% (p = 0.0425) and age 8.7% (p < 0.009) of the variants in TG levels. The presence of the E2 allele in heart-transplant recipients produces a greater rise in total TG plasma levels than the other genotypes.
