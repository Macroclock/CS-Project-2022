Severe left main stem stenosis in a cardiac transplant recipient: successful treatment by coronary stenting. A 58-year-old male underwent orthotopic cardiac transplantation for ischemic cardiomyopathy. At routine coronary angiography 2 years later, he was found to have severe concentric stenosis of the left main coronary artery but was asymptomatic. Revascularization was recommended on prognostic grounds and after discussion with his cardiac transplant surgeon, percutaneous coronary intervention with elective stenting was offered. This was performed successfully with a single stent and a good angiographic result was maintained 6 and 18 months later.
