Cyclosporin A increases basal intracellular calcium and calcium responses to endothelin and vasopressin in human coronary myocytes. Cyclosporin A (CsA) is a widely used immunosuppressive agent with severe side effects including hypertension. Here, we investigated the effects of CsA on intracellular free calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) and the mechanisms involved in vasoconstriction in cultured human coronary myocytes. We used the Fura-2 technique for Ca(2+) imaging. Acute application of CsA at therapeutic concentrations (0.1-10 micromol/l) had no effect. Chronic exposure to CsA (1 micromol/l) for 24 h induced a small (20 nmol/l) but highly significant increase of basal [Ca(2+)](i) and enhanced the occurrence of spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations. Endothelin- and vasopressin-induced rises of [Ca(2+)](i) were also enhanced. The demonstration that CsA increases basal [Ca(2+)](i) in addition to its impact on agonist receptor stimulation is of major importance for new therapeutic approaches.
