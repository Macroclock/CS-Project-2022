Endothelin-1 circulating levels increase in patients with orthotopic heart transplantation and in chronic therapy with cyclosporine. The aim of the study was to investigate the behaviour of plasma levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1), an endothelial peptide with vasoconstrictive and proliferative actions, in patients with cardiac transplantation and in chronic treatment with cyclosporine A, some of whom became hypertensive after cardiac transplantation. We studied: 1) 18 consecutive patients (15 M, 3F; mean age 53 +/- 7 yrs) who underwent cardiac transplantation about six months ago at least (range 6-108 months); 2) 15 patients with essential arterial hypertension (10 M, 5 F; mean age 42 +/- 15 yrs) without organ damage; 3) 21 normal subjects (15 M, 6 F; mean age 31 +/- 12 yrs). Plasma levels of ET-1 (RIA), haemodynamic and functional renal parameters were determined in all groups and plasma levels of cyclosporine were measured in patients with cardiac transplantation. ET-1 was higher in patients with cardiac transplantation than in the other two groups (p < 0.05); instead there was no difference between patients with essential arterial hypertension and controls (p>0.05). A statistical difference was found between circulating ET-1 in hypertensive transplanted patients. In heart transplanted patients a positive and significative correlation was found between plasma levels of ET-1 and systolic (r=0.525; p<0.037) blood pressure.
