Hypotensive reactions associated with transfusion of bedside leukocyte-reduction filtered blood products in heart transplanted patients. Severe hypotensive reactions that occur during transfusions of blood products to non-transplanted patients were recently linked to the use of bedside leukocyte-reduction filters, sometimes in association with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment. We present the first report of such reactions in patients who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation. Fourteen (47%) of the 30 transfused patients experienced severe hypotensive reaction during filtered transfusion of at least 1 unit of blood product, with a total of 24 episodes. Eleven (79%) of these patients were treated pre-operatively with ACE inhibitors.
