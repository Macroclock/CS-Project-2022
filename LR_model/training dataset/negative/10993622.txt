Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for cardiac support in pediatric patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used for pediatric cardiac support in settings of expected mortality due to severe myocardial dysfunction. We reviewed the records of 34 children (<18 years) placed on ECMO between March 1995 and May 1999. Demographic, cardiac, noncardiac, and outcome variables were recorded. Data were subjected to univariate analysis to define predictors of outcome. Eighteen patients were placed on ECMO after cardiac surgery (Group A); seven of 18 were weaned off ECMO, and four survived to discharge (22%). Thirteen patients were placed on ECMO as a bridge to cardiac transplantation (Group B), six of 13 received a heart transplant, one recovered spontaneously, and six survived to discharge (46%). Three patients were placed on ECMO for failed cardiac transplantation while awaiting a second transplant (Group C); one recovered graft function, two received a second heart transplant, and two of three survived (66%). The primary cause of death was multiorgan system failure (68%). Group A patients supported on ECMO for more than 6 days did not survive. Mediastinal bleeding complications and renal failure requiring dialysis were associated with nonsurvival. We conclude that ECMO as a bridge to cardiac transplant was more successful than ECMO support after cardiotomy. Mediastinal bleeding and renal failure were associated with poor outcome. Recovery of cardiac function occurred within the first week of ECMO support if at all. Longer support did not result in survival without transplantation.
