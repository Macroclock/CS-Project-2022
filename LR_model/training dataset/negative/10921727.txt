Heterotopic cardiac transplantation and Batista operation. We report the case of an infant who was first seen with dilated cardiomyopathy at the age of 3 1/2 months and 2 months later, successfully underwent heterotopic cardiac transplantation in combination with partial left ventriculectomy. The benefits of combining both procedures in such a young infant particularly with regard to containment of early graft dysfunction, reduction of respiratory problems, and weight mismatch are discussed.
