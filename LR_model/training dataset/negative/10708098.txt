Expression of tissue factor mRNA in cardiac xenografts: clues to the pathogenesis of acute vascular rejection. Acute vascular rejection destroys vascularized xenografts over a period of hours to days and is now considered the major hurdle to the clinical application of xenotransplantation. The hallmark of acute vascular rejection is diffuse intravascular coagulation; however, the pathogenesis of coagulation is a matter of controversy. One line of evidence points to activated endothelial cells and another to activated inflammatory cells as a source of tissue factor and thus as a primary cause of this lesion. The distinction between the two mechanisms inducing coagulation in the xenograft provides an opportunity for specific intervention. To explore these mechanisms, we studied the expression of tissue factor mRNA by in situ reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in relation to the histopathologic manifestations of acute vascular rejection in guinea pig hearts transplanted into rats treated by cobra venom factor to avoid the hyperacute rejection. Three hours after transplantation and before the deposition of fibrin, tissue factor mRNA was expressed in the endothelial cells lining small and medium blood vessels and in smooth muscle cells of guinea pig cardiac xenografts. Sixteen hours after transplantation, while rat tissue factor mRNA was expressed only in occasional infiltrating cells, cardiac xenografts showed prominent deposits of fibrin in small vessels. Maximum expression of tissue factor on rat infiltrating cells was observed 48 hr after transplantation. These results suggest that in acute vascular rejection, coagulation is initiated on the donor vascular system, while the procoagulant characteristics of infiltrating cells may reflect a response to tissue injury rather than a cause.
