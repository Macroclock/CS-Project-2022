[Liver transplantation with a graft taken from a heart transplant patient who was brain-dead]. The shortage of organ donors has led to progressive softening of selection criteria for organ donation. We report on hepatic transplantation in a 55-year-old woman with primary biliary cirrhosis, whose donor was a 50-year-old heart transplant recipient who became brain stem dead, due to cerebral bleeding 8 months after transplantation. An orthotopic liver transplantation was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful and the recipient was alive and had normal liver function after a 42-month follow-up. Analysis of the literature included ethical consideration, potential hepatotoxic effects of immunosuppressive drugs and modification of the graft immunogenicity. It confirms that transplanted patients should not be a priori excluded from organ donation.
