Left circumflex coronary artery-to-left atrium fistulas detected by transesophageal echocardiography in heart transplant recipients. Coronary fistulas are uncommon after heart transplantation. We report two cases of fistulas from an atrial branch of the circumflex coronary artery to the left atrium after heart transplantation. This has not been previously reported in the literature. They were detected with transesophageal echocardiography, and images are shown for the first time. Transesophageal echocardiography may be useful in the follow-up of heart transplant recipients.
