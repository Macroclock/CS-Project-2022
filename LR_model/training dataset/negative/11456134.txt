Fatal atypical mycobacterial infection in a cardiac transplant recipient. A 37-year-old female underwent heart transplantation for giant cell myocarditis. The patient died within three-and-a-half months of cardiac transplantation. Postmortem specimens from the heart and lung showed multiple necrotizing granulomas with numerous acid-fast bacilli. Polymerase chain reaction done on both the postmortem samples confirmed the presence of atypical mycobacterial infection. This fatal case of atypical mycobacteriosis in a cardiac transplant patient is reported for its rarity.
