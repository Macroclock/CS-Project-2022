Heart transplantation in children in foreign countries with reference to medical, transportation, and financial issues. Heart transplantation is increasingly becoming accepted worldwide as therapy for end-stage heart failure not only in adult patients but also in pediatric practice. The new law in Japan for organ transplantation from brain-dead patients was established on 16 October 1998, but there is no definite law or protocol for brain death in children under the age of 6 years and children less than 15 years of age cannot become donors. These facts make organ transplantation from the cadavers of neonates, infants and young children almost impossible in Japan, even though there are children who need heart or heart-lung transplantation. The present authors have to date transferred 8 patients to the USA or Germany for heart transplantation: 4 successfully underwent heart transplantation, but 4 died during the waiting period overseas. There are many things to consider; not only the medical problems involved in transportation, but also the financial issues when transferring patients to other countries. This report details the experience with the 8 cases that were transferred overseas for heart transplantation, and highlights the problems that need to be considered.
