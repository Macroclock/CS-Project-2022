Cardiac allograft vasculopathy--the cellular attack. Studies using genetically manipulated mice show that CD4 T cells and macrophages are important components of the recipient response to transplanted tissues, playing a major role in the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). Under attack, the cells of the graft respond by producing cytokines and growth factors that ultimately lead to fibroproliferative lesions in the graft vasculature. The progression and severity of these lesions are influenced by genetic variation in both donor and recipient.
