Autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation following heart transplantation for primary systemic amyloidosis. A 47 years old woman was admitted with severe congestive heart failure. Cardiac echography showed increased intra-ventricular septum thickness, and there was a serum Ig G lambda monoclonal component. Cardiac biopsies confirmed diffuse amyloidosis of Al type. To avoid cardiac toxicity of chemotherapy, the patient received first a heart transplantation (HT), followed six months later by melphalan 200 mg/m(2) and autologous peripheral blood stem cell support (PBSCT). This case suggests that such strategy is feasible with a favorable outcome, and HT may be an appropriate procedure for some patients with Al amyloidosis who meet the criteria for PBSCT.
