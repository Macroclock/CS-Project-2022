Allograft tolerance induced by cyclophosphamide without prior inoculation of donor cells--immune suppression and redirection. To determine the possibility and cellular mechanism of inducing allograft tolerance by multiple injection of a lower dose of cyclophosphamide without prior infusion of donor cells. Heterotopic heart grafts were performed in MHC mismatched strain combinations (C57/B6 vs. BALB/c). Cyclophosphamide (40 mg/kg) was given intravenously on days 0, 2, 4 and 7 without prior infusion of donor cells. Long-term (> 100 days) allograft survival with normal histology was achieved. The long-term survivors accepted the donor skin grafts, but rejected the third-party skin grafts. Cyclophosphamide treatment initially led to profound lymphocytopenia, inhibition of spontaneous blastogenesis and low levels of lymphocyte proliferation response to both donor and third-party antigens. Ultimately, donor-specific tolerance occurred demonstrated by normal levels of peripheral lymphocytes, spontaneous blastogenesis and lymphocyte proliferation response to third-party antigens, and low levels of lymphocyte proliferation response to donor antigen. A switch of cytokines from IFNgamma dominant to IL-4 dominant, a low level of IgM and a high level of IgG1 were found in tolerant mice. Allograft tolerance can be induced by a short course of cyclophosphamide without prior donor cell inoculation. Tolerance induced is characterized initially by non-specific immunosuppression, which progresses to donor-specific hyporesponsiveness associated with the development of a Th2 dominant cytokine response.
