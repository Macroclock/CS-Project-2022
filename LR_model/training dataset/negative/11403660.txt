First experiences with outpatient care of patients with implanted axial flow pumps. As known from patients with pulsatile ventricular assist devices (VADs), early mobilization, physical exercise, and return to normal life are essential for optimal recovery. Recently, implantable rotary pumps became available for extended left ventricular support as bridges to transplantation. Modified procedures are essential for patient training and hospital discharge. The MicroMed-DeBakey VAD was implanted in 10 patients with end-stage heart disease. After recovery, regular ergometer training was performed with loads adapted to the patient's condition. Procedures for patient observation under outdoor conditions and a blood pressure measuring device for low pulse pressure conditions were developed. Improvement of physical condition was achieved in 8 patients. In the first 2 patients, exercise capacity was limited due to flow obstruction. In the following patients, an increase of workload on the ergometer up to 120 W was observed. Correlated with training, lactate/load relationship and heart rate decreased. Three patients were discharged from the hospital during support. The DeBakey-VAD system can support patients for extended time periods and is suitable for recovery and exercise. Under optimal patient and environmental conditions, discharge from the hospital can be obtained.
