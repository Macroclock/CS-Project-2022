Parental considerations for children undergoing cardiac transplantation. There have been profound improvements in the survival of children following cardiac transplantation as surgical techniques, organ preservation, and immunosuppression have advanced. The sensitivity to individual parental differences and concerns throughout the beginning and long-term experience of pediatric cardiac transplantation must be accompanied by support from all the members of the transplant team. Quality of life for children, measured as functional status, at 3 years posttransplant is reported to be excellent. This quality of life is dependent not only on the medical and surgical success of the procedure, but also on an intact, supportive family. Further research needs to be done on quality of life issues after pediatric cardiac transplantation. Beyond the long-term medical, developmental, and psychological impact of the transplanted child, studies need to address the emotional, social, and financial impact of transplantation on the parents and the well siblings.
