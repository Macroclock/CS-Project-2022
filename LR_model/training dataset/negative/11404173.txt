A leukocyte depleting filter reduces endothelial cell dysfunction and improves transplanted canine heart function. To date leukocytes have been known to play a major role in reperfusion injury and have directed attention to leukocyte-endothelium interaction. This study was designed to investigate how much graft viability and the coronary microcirculatory function could be preserved by leukocyte depletion (LD) in a model of orthotopic cardiac transplantation. The heart in 10 beagle dogs was arrested by introducing a 4 degrees C St. Thomas' cardioplegic solution. They were harvested, immersed in the cold saline for 3 hours, and then orthotopically transplanted. Five recipients underwent LD (LD group) at reperfusion with the use of a Pall BC1B leukocyte depleting filter inserted into the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit. The other 5 dogs without filtration served as a control group. Leukocytes were about 80% filtrated and neutrophils were also 85% filtrated during the first 30 minutes of reperfusion in the LD group. A high level of adenosine triphosphate was maintained after transplantation in the LD group. The polymorphonuclear elastase level was significantly lower in the LD group. The cardiac function assessed by the slopes of the end-systolic pressure volume relation after transplantation was significantly higher in the LD group than in the control group (p < 0.05). The coronary vascular resistance responses to acetylcholine and nitroglycerin after transplantation were preserved significantly better in the LD group than in the control group (p < 0.05). These results suggest that a leukocyte depleting filter placed in the CPB circuit would prevent leukocyte-mediated endothelial cell injury, improve microcirculation of the myocardium, and lead to excellent graft function.
