Prognostic value of neurohormonal activation and cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with chronic heart failure. We compared the value of plasma neurohormones and cardiopulmonary exercise testing for predicting long-term prognosis in patients with moderate congestive heart failure (CHF). We studied 264 consecutive patients with CHF due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), norepinephrine, and endothelin-1 were measured at rest in all patients, who also underwent a symptom-limited maximal exercise with oxygen consumption (VO(2)) determination. After a median follow-up of 789 days, 52 deaths and 31 heart transplantations occurred, of which 4 were urgent. In an univariate analysis, New York Heart Association functional class, systolic blood pressure at rest, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, left ventricular ejection fraction, peak VO(2), percent of predicted peak VO(2), plasma ANP, plasma norepinephrine, and plasma endothelin-1 were associated with survival without urgent heart transplantation. In a multivariate stepwise regression analysis, only plasma ANP (p = 0.0001), left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.007), and plasma norepinephrine (p = 0.035), but neither peak VO(2) nor percentage of predicted peak VO(2), were independent predictors of death or urgent heart transplantation. Determination of plasma ANP and norepinephrine provides additional independent information for long-term prognostic determination compared with exercise testing alone. Measurement of plasma neurohormones should therefore be considered routinely as a complementary or alternative tool for identifying high-risk patients with moderate CHF.
