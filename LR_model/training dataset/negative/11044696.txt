Interatrial conduction of atrial tachycardia in heart transplant recipients: potential pathophysiology. Surgical suture lines formed at the site of anastamosis have been considered to be electrically inert and thus present a line of block to conduction. However, a number of reports have suggested that conduction is occasionally possible across suture lines. Most of these cases have reported conduction between donor and recipient atria following cardiac transplantation. We report an illustrative case successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation, and present pathology findings that may give insight into the pathophysiology.
