Hemorrhagic colitis due to a novel Escherichia coli serotype (O121:H19) in a transplant patient. Infection due to enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) has not been described in immunosuppressed patients. We recently saw a case of EHEC infection caused by a novel Shiga toxin II-producing Escherichia coli serotype (O121:H19) that caused hemorrhagic colitis in a patient with renal and cardiac transplants. The patient's signs, symptoms, and colon pathology were similar to reports of EHEC infection in immunocompetent patients. This case suggests that the immunosuppressed state may not alter the clinical presentation or histopathologic findings of this disorder. Assays for EHEC are not routinely done at most hospitals. Therefore, clinicians caring for transplant patients should be aware of the typical clinical presentation of EHEC infection, so that they can initiate appropriate laboratory investigation in suspected cases.
