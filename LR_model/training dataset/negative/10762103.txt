The role of patients' ability to pay, gender, and smoking history on public attitudes toward cardiac transplant allocation: an experimental investigation. This study assessed public attitudes toward organ allocation through vignettes that were varied by patient's ability to pay (insured or uninsured), gender, and smoking history (current, former, or never). Participants were 681 adults contacted at a state driver's license office who read a vignette about a heart transplant candidate and subsequently rated their likelihood and priority of offering transplantation. Results revealed main effects for patient smoking history exclusively. Post hoc analyses for likelihood of offering transplantation revealed that participants gave higher ratings for never smokers than current smokers. For priority of transplantation, analyses revealed higher ratings for never smokers than for both former smokers and current smokers. Results suggest that public opinion about organ allocation may include the consideration of smoking history but not ability to pay or gender.
