Altered expression of matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases in acutely rejected myocardium and coronary arteriosclerosis in cardiac allografts of nonhuman primates. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are important in any process of tissue remodeling. However, there is no report evaluating their expression in cardiac allografts in human or non-human primates. Heterotopic cardiac transplantation was performed on Japanese monkeys. Subjects were treated with chimeric anti-human lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 monoclonal antibody for 2 weeks. Heart grafts were harvested at days 1-95 (n = 7). Native monkey hearts were used as controls (n = 2). We examined expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 using immunohistochemistry and in situ reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In the myocardium, the expression of MMP-2 was increased in the spindle-shaped cells of acutely rejected myocardial interstitium and prior to the presence of mononuclear cell infiltration at days 1-41. TIMP-1 and 2 expression was enhanced in association with the progression of fibrosis at days 40-95. In the coronary arteries of chronically rejected allografts, enhanced MMP and decreased TIMP expression was observed in both thickened intima and media at days 40-95. The medial MMP mRNA expression was observed before the development of intimal thickening occurred at days 7-28. MMPs are critical for the progression of acute and chronic rejection, and TIMP predominance plays important roles in fibrosis in association with acute rejection. Expression of MMPs and TIMPs is a sensitive indicator of acute and chronic cardiac rejection.
