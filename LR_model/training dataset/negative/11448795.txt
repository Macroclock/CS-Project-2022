Severe tricuspid regurgitation after heart transplantation. Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is common after heart transplantation. However, the incidence of severe TR and the incidence of symptoms after echocardiographic diagnosis of severe TR have not been documented. The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of severe TR and its clinical significance in the heart transplant population. We reviewed echocardiograms (echo) of all heart transplant patients coming for regular echocardiographic follow-up between 1990 and 1995. We reviewed the charts of all patients who had echo diagnosis of severe TR. A total of 336 patients had echo follow-up during this time period. The number of months post-heart transplant to last echo was 54 +/- 50 (range, 1 to 265 months). Ninety patients had moderate TR and 23 patients had severe TR. Mean time from heart transplantation to diagnosis of severe TR was 43 +/- 38 months (range, 1 to 132). Using Cutler-Ederer analysis, at 5 years, 92.2% of surviving patients were free from severe TR. At 10 years, 85.8% of surviving patients were free from severe TR. Of the 23 patients with severe TR, 17 had charts available for review. The mean number of prior endomyocardial biopsies was 28 +/- 21 (range, 3 to 88). These patients were followed for 35 +/- 18 months after diagnosis. During this period, they developed significant heart failure and peripheral edema. Six patients eventually underwent tricuspid valve replacement. Moderate to severe TR commonly occurs following heart transplantation. Severe TR is associated with significant morbidity.
