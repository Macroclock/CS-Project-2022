Angiographic presentation of coronary artery spasm in heart transplant recipients. We describe the angiographic characteristics of coronary artery spasm observed in 12 out of 247 (4.9%) patients who underwent 808 coronary angiographies after heart transplantation. Coronary artery spasm was diagnosed when localized and reversible narrowing of the coronary lumen was identified. After coronary artery spasm identification all patients were followed-up clinically for a mean period of 5.1 years. Coronary artery spasm was documented 1-3 years after heart transplant. Coronary artery spasm affected 1 main coronary artery in 10 patients and 2 in 2 patients; in 3 patients 1 or more secondary branches were also affected. The right coronary artery was affected by coronary artery spasm in 8 patients and the anterior descending coronary artery in 6 patients. In 6 patients coronary artery spasm was mechanically induced by the catheter tip. The degree of luminal narrowing due to coronary artery spasm ranged from mild to almost complete occlusion. Coronary artery spasm appeared as a single tubular smooth and concentric stenosis in 8 patients, was discrete in 2 patients and multiple on the same vessel in 2 patients. In 1 patient coronary artery spasm was erroneously interpreted as an organic lesion and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was planned. During follow-up 3 patients out of 4 who had shown multiple coronary artery spasm died and 2 patients developed critical organic stenosis. In conclusion coronary artery spasm after heart transplant is less rare than commonly believed. Although it usually has a peculiar appearance, it can be misinterpreted as an organic lesion. Multiple coronary artery spasm appears to carry a poor prognosis.
