[Variation in cholesterol, lipoproteins and triglycerides after heart transplantation in children]. Total cholesterol, HDL and LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels may contribute to the development or progression of coronary artery disease of the transplanted heart. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the short and long-term lipid profiles of transplanted children and to identify factors influencing these dyslipidemias. Twenty-three patients aged 9.5 +/- 5.9 years at cardiac transplantation were followed up for 5.8 +/- 3.1 years. All were on triple therapy with normal diets. The total cholesterol increased by 17% during the first year (4.47 +/- 1.01 mMol/l to 5.25 +/- 1.22 mMol/l at 1 year: p < 0.05) with a peak at 3 months of 5.31 +/- 1.28 mMol/l correlating with the dosage of prescribed corticosteroids. LDL-cholesterol levels increased by 20% during the first year (2.26 +/- 0.67 mMol/l to 3.29 +/- 0.99 mMol/l at 1 year: p = 0.018). HDL-cholesterol levels increased from 1.02 +/- 0.27 mMol/l to a maximum of 1.55 +/- 0.4 mMol/l at 1 year, p < 0.05. Lipoprotein A1, a protecting sub-fraction of HDL, did not change significantly. Changes in triglyceride levels were not significant despite a tendency to hypertriglyceridaemia in the early phases. After one year, serum cholesterol and lipoprotein levels remained higher than the initial values. These results show that cardiac transplant children are exposed to the risk of atherogenic hyperlipidaemia and require systematic lipid profile monitoring, dietary advice and lipid lowering drugs.
