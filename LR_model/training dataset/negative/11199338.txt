Uptake of prolactin and tyroliberin by the heart. The aim of this study was to observe the specificity of prolactin and tyroliberin uptake and thus to determine their affinity for the heart ventricles and atria. Comparison of the uptake of the examined substances revealed that more of these hormones reached the atria than the ventricles. The contents of prolactin and tyroliberin in the atria were statistically significant compared with 125J. The results observed provide evidence for nonuniform prolactin uptake by the heart.
