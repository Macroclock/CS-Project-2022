Comparison of myocardial oxygen consumption using 11C acetate positron emission tomography scanning in a working and non-working heart transplant model. In acute cardiac rejection, changes in myocardial oxygen consumption occur; non-invasive detection of these metabolic changes would have obvious clinical utility. In the classic cervical, heterotopic, canine, transplant model, the heart is non-working. It has a low myocardial oxygen consumption. Creation of a working model with normal myocardial oxygen consumption would enhance validity of non-human studies. Clearance of 11C acetate was determined by positron emission tomography (PET) scanning and compared with myocardial oxygen consumption in normal and transplanted canine hearts. Donor hearts from mongrel dogs (2.5-3 kg; n=4) were transplanted into the neck of adult beagles (12-15 kg; n=4), no immunosuppression was given. Two non-working hearts were modified to eject only coronary flow via the right ventricle. In two hearts, a novel working model was created with aortic regurgitation to load the left ventricle. Working and non-working hearts underwent PET scanning on post-operative days 2 and 4. Normal dog hearts (n=2) and native hearts of transplanted dogs (n=3) were used to validate the scanning technique. Coronary sinus and aortic oxygen saturation data along with myocardial blood flow (radiolabeled microspheres) confirmed that clearance of 11C acetate in normal and transplanted hearts followed a bi-exponential model. Myocardial oxygen consumption was correlated with the rate constant of 11C acetate rapid phase clearance (r=0.91) in normal and transplanted hearts. The working hearts had increased myocardial oxygen consumption compared to non-working hearts. This study (1) introduces a model of a working heterotopic cardiac transplantation with near-normal oxygen consumption; and (2) demonstrates that regional myocardial oxygen consumption in transplanted hearts can be detected by 11C acetate PET.
