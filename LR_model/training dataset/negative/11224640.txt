Heart transplantation indicated only in the most severely ill patient: perspectives from the German heart transplant experience. The COCPIT study, performed in a complete national cohort of adult patients consecutively listed for cardiac transplantation in Germany in 1997, found a beneficial effect only in the group that was at high risk of dying from heart failure without transplantation. If these results can be reproduced in other countries, the discussion on the respective roles of pharmacological and organ-saving surgical therapies for advanced heart failure, medical urgency and waiting time as heart transplantation allocation criteria, and the feasibility of a randomized clinical trial testing the survival benefit of transplantation must be reopened.
