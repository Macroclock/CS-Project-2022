[Long-term management after heart transplantation--an assessment of current status]. Due to an improvement of results after heart transplantation, there is a continuously growing number of long-term surviving patients. Aimed at a characterization of established diagnostic and therapeutic protocols, the Working Group of Thoracic Organ Transplantation within the German Society of Cardiology performed a survey among all German heart transplantation centers. Based on the experience of 1,500 patients, the clinical relevance as well as approaches for prevention and treatment of rejection, infection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, malignancy, hypertension, renal insufficiency, and quality of life were assessed by a questionnaire. As a result, a time dependency of expected complications could clearly be shown. While early after HTX acute rejection and infection episodes were judged as clinically important, later on cardiac allograft vasculopathy, malignancy, and renal insufficiency predominate as relevant complications. This spectrum was reflected by a differentiated diagnostic protocol (early after HTX more frequent diagnostic procedures for rejection and infection, later intensified examinations to identify cardiac allograft vascular disease and malignancy) as well as by different intensities of immunosuppression and concomittant medication. Regarding further improvement of survival rates and quality of life, future clinical and scientific activities should be focused on the prevention of late complications after heart transplantation.
