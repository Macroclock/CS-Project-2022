Insights into ventricular repolarization abnormalities in cardiac allograft vasculopathy. We investigated the relationship of QT dispersion and cardiac allograft vasculopathy in heart transplant recipients. The findings suggest that the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy is associated with an increase in QT dispersion, suggesting the presence of abnormal repolarization in these patients.
