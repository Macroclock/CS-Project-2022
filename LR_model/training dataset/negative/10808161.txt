Lack of acute cyclosporine nephrotoxicity in late heart-transplant recipients. Cyclosporine induces daily renal hypoperfusion in subjects with normal atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels, but its acute effects in heart transplant patients with increased ANP remain to be determined. Cyclosporinemia and creatinine clearance were monitored during 7 hours following cyclosporine administration in 6 heart transplant patients. No acute cyclosporine-induced decrease in creatinine clearance was observed after heart transplantation. These data suggest that maintenance cyclosporine dose may be less nephrotoxic than suspected and that increased ANP might protect the renal function late after heart transplantation.
