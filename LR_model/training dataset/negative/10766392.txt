Oral findings in three different groups of immunocompromised patients. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of oral, dental and periodontal findings in three different groups of immunocompromised patients and in a healthy control group, to evaluate whether there is a correlation between manifestations of disease and immunologic parameters. The survey included 46 patients with a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus, 48 heart transplant recipients, and 53 adult patients suffering from acute leukemias. Fifty matched healthy subjects were used as a control group. Each patient had to answer questions on medical and dental health and underwent a thorough oral, dental and serological investigation. Oral mucosal lesions were found in nearly half of all immunocompromised patients (49.6%), but in only 26% of control patients. No significant associations were found between different types of oral lesions and the underlying cause of immunosuppression. Leukemia patients showed age-unrelated higher scores in periodontal indices (P<0.05). Laboratory parameters failed to be significant in the assessment of oral health.
