[Blade atrial septostomy in an infant with hypoplastic left heart syndrome awaiting heart transplantation]. Blade atrial septostomy was performed in a 36 day-old infant diagnosed with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and restrictive atrial septal defect. The patient was awaiting cardiac transplantation. The defect was enlarged using a 9.4-cm blade. The mean atrial gradient was reduced from 19 to 2mmHg. After septostomy the patient showed marked clinical improvement and aortic oxygen saturation increased from 68% to 88% with no complications. Twenty-five days later orthotopic heart transplantation was successfully performed.
