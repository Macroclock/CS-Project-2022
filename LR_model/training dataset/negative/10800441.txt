[Cytomegalovirus infection after heart transplantation. Retrospective analysis of an antiviral CMV prevention]. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most common viral infection in the early period after heart transplantation (HTX) and causes a significant morbidity and mortality. Although controversial, CMV is related to acute and chronic allograft rejection and to the development of graft vascular disease. It therefore plays an important role in the long-time outcome after solid organ transplantation. 45 patients received a new heart between 1.1.97 and 31.12.1998. All of them were enrolled postoperatively in three-month antiviral prophylaxis (Cymevene). Only those patients were excluded from prophylaxis who were seronegative for CMV and received hearts from seronegative donors (n = 6). The pp65 antigenaemia assay and the murex hybrid capture CMV DNA assay on peripheral blood as well as the early antigen detection in the urine were used for CMV detection and also for monitoring. A total number of 580 assays were analysed (12.9 assays/patient). 561 tests (96.7%) were negative, 19 (3.3%) were positive. For CMV testing the pp65 antigenemia assay was used in 64.1%, the murex hybrid capture CMV DNA assay in 18.4% and the urine early antigen detection in 17.4%. Three patients (6.7%) developed viraemia during the first 3 postoperative months. Two patients (4.4%) suffered from CMV infection 8 and 9 months after heart transplantation and had to be treated with antiviral agents. Three patients (6.7%) died early after transplantation, but none had a CMV infection. Prevention of CMV disease was successful with three months of antiviral CMV prophylaxis after HTX. Asymptomatic viraemia during the prophylaxis period did not lead to tissue invasive disease. It is possible to carry out rapid CMV detection and CMV monitoring with the commercially available antigenaemia assays.
