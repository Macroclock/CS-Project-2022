Anaesthetic management of baboons undergoing heterotopic porcine cardiac xenotransplantation. A detailed anaesthetic technique for baboons (Papio anubis) undergoing heterotopic abdominal cardiac xenotransplantation is described. Twenty-two baboons served as transplant recipients. Donors were either crossbred farm pigs (Sus scrofa) (n = 4) or transgenic pigs (Sus scroefa) (n = 18) expressing human complement regulatory proteins on the endothelium. Intra-operative management was complicated by the physiological consequences of infrarenal. abdominal aortic cross-clamping, in addition to the immunological sequelae related to cross-species transplantation. In choosing anaesthetics for this procedure, we considered the need for maximal cardiac stability throughout a long surgical procedure that required abdominal aortic cross-clamping to facilitate the implantation of an oversized porcine cardiac graft. Baboons received a balanced anaesthetic consisting of inhaled isoflurane in oxygen, intravenous fentanyl and intravenous pancuronium. The pharmacological techniques employed were found to be safe and reliable and were well tolerated by our recipients without any significant side-effects.
