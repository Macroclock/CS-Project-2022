The role of magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy in transplantation: from animal models to man. Critical success factors in solid organ and vascular transplantation are the assessment of graft status/viability as well as stringent monitoring of transplant recipients, preferentially using noninvasive techniques. This review addresses the application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) in the field of transplantation. The first section is devoted to the description of the main MR techniques used for monitoring the status of the graft noninvasively. Subsequently, the role of MRI/MRS in the analysis of the viability of organs for transplantation is discussed. Since chronic rejection remains a major difficulty, development of new therapies is still ongoing. Thus, the third part is devoted to the use of MRI/MRS for monitoring graft rejection in animal models of transplantation. This is followed by a discussion of clinical studies of transplantation involving MRI/MRS. Finally, a general appraisal is made on available imaging techniques for the non-invasive characterization of grafts in situ, highlighting the role of MR methods in the field of transplantation.
