[Strategies for a greater supply of organs for transplantation]. The number of recipients waiting for a solid organ transplantation has increased greatly in the past 5 years. The supply of donor organs during this period has not kept pace, resulting in a large shortage of suitable organs. In an effort to overcome the disparity between supply of donor and demands, various strategies have emerged to expand the existing donor selection criteria. Kidneys from very old donors can be used successfully when a pre-transplant biopsy shows a modest degree of glomerular injury. Kidneys from donors of 50 years or more, or with a history of hypertension and diabetes, or other evidence of renal disease, currently not accepted for single' kidney transplantation, provide excellent function when transplanted together. In contrast, one liver can be enough for two patients. Split-liver transplantation, i.e. sharing one liver between an adult and a pediatric recipient, is becoming routine procedure and has the potential for meeting the need for liver replacement among children without interfering with adult waiting list. Splitting the liver for transplantation in two adults is a further step forward in the more efficient use of hepatic grafts from cadaver donors. Adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation can further alleviate the pressure in the waiting list, but the risk for the donor must not be underestimated. The decrease in the number of heart-lung transplants in favour of more single and double lung transplants has also made more hearts and more lungs available. It is difficult to quantify the impact of all these procedures on the shortage of organ donors, but the waiting list should be cut by at least one-third for kidney and may be more for liver and lung transplants.
