Aortic dissection with fistula to right atrium after heart transplantation: diagnosis by transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. Aortic dissection with rupture into the right atrium is an extremely rare and rapidly fatal condition that may occur after cardiac surgery. We report the case of a 59-year-old woman with a 6-year history of heart transplantation who presented with subacute illness characterized by chest pain and severe cardiac decompensation accompanied by a continuous murmur in the precordium. The diagnosis of aortic dissection complicated by right atrial fistula was made by the combination of transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic examination.
