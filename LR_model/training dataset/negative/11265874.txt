Device and patient management in a bridge-to-transplant setting. A variety of sophisticated devices have been developed for mechanical circulatory support in patients bridged to cardiac transplantation. Based on 13 years' experience, we have developed specific protocols for patient selection and management for different devices. The principal systems applied in the bridge-to-transplant cohort are the Thoratec ventricular assist device (n = 144, mean duration of support 53 +/- 57 days), the Novacor left ventricular assist system (LVAS) (n = 85, mean duration of support 154 +/- 15 days), and the HeartMate LVAS (n = 54, mean duration of support 143 +/- 142 days). The Thoratec device is used for biventricular assistance or if the duration of support is expected to be less than 6 months. For long-term support, either the Novacor or HeartMate LVAS are preferred. Despite careful postoperative patient management, this group of patients is prone to a variety of complications. Bleeding occurred in 22% to 35%, right heart failure in 15% to 26%, neurologic disorders in 7% to 28%, infection in 7% to 30%, and liver failure in 11% to 20% of patients. Complications varied with the device applied and the patient's preoperative condition. A total of 73 patients were discharged from hospital for a mean period of 184 days; this cumulative experience amounted to 37.5 patient-years. The Novacor and the HeartMate systems offer the additional possibility of discharging patients during support if they fulfill certain criteria. The main reasons for rehospitalization were thromboembolic and infectious complications.
