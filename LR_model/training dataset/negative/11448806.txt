A technique of heterotopic, infrarenal heart transplantation with double anastomosis in mice. Mouse heart transplantation is frequently used to investigate mechanisms of rejection and immune response. A fully vascularized technique is presented in which the graft ascending aorta is anastomosed end-to-side to the recipient's aorta and the pulmonary aorta is anastomosed end-to-side to the inferior vena cava using 11-0 Ethilon suture. We suggest that this double anastomosis technique is a valuable tool to investigate immune mechanisms in mice.
