Role of apoptosis in cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a major long-term complication of heart transplantation. Coronary endothelial injury provokes immunological reactions leading to inflammation and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Recent studies suggest that cell death of endothelial cells during early phases of transplant arteriopathy development proceeds via programmed cell death (apoptosis). The potential role of apoptosis in CAV is discussed. Based on these concepts, therapeutic strategies might be envisaged aimed at the prevention of apoptosis during the initiating phase of CAV.
