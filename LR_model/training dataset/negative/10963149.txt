Cardiac pacemakers in the transplanted heart: short term with the biatrial anastomosis and unnecessary with the bicaval anastomosis. Sinus node dysfunction occurs commonly after orthotopic heart transplantation and may be caused by surgical trauma, ischemia to the sinus node, rejection, drug therapy and increasing donor age. In the past, using the standard biatrial technique described originally by Lower and Shumway, many series have reported permanent pacing in more than 10% of patients. Unlike sinus node dysfunction in nontransplanted patients, which typically worsens with time, sinus node dysfunction in the transplanted heart usually improves over a period of weeks to months. Delaying the implantation of a permanent pacemaker may render it unnecessary. The development of the bicaval technique for implantation of the donor heart appears to have decreased even further or even eliminated the need for early permanent pacing. Because sinus node dysfunction in the transplanted heart does not predict subsequent development of atrioventricular (AV) node dysfunction, rate-responsive atrial pacing should be used in the majority of cases. Even after appropriate pacing for sinus node dysfunction, the sinus node may recover and permanent pacing may be discontinued. AV conduction abnormalities are far less common and generally occur late after transplantation. Dual-chamber pacing is required and permanent pacing should be continued indefinitely.
