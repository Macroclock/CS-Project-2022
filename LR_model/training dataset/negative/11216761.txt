Posttransplant function of a nonbeating heart is predictable by an ex vivo perfusion method. We attempted to predict the posttransplant cardiac function of nonbeating donor hearts. A total of 13 dogs were studied. Hearts were left in situ for 45 minutes after cardiac arrest caused by exsanguination. Hearts were then excised and reperfused in an ex vivo perfusion apparatus after 60 minutes of warm ischemia to test whether they could eject against an 80 mm Hg afterload from a preload of 10 mm Hg. Thereafter, all hearts were transplanted orthotopically. Four of 13 hearts were able to eject in the apparatus (group A). However, the other nine hearts could not eject under the defined conditions (group B). All four hearts in group A showed good posttransplant hemodynamics (systolic arterial pressure > 80 mm Hg with mean left atrial pressure < 10 mm Hg) without dopamine. However, none of nine hearts in group B could support the circulation without dopamine. Nonbeating donor heart function evaluated in the perfusion apparatus predicts posttransplant heart function. This method may be applicable for selection of transplantable hearts from nonbeating heart donors.
