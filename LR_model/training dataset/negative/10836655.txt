Heart transplantation for radiation-associated end-stage heart failure. Radiation-induced heart disease is an increasingly recognized late sequela of mediastinal radiation therapy for malignant neoplasms. We report four cases of heart transplantation for end-stage heart failure induced by mediastinal radiation therapy. Short-term and intermediate-term results are excellent with all four patients currently surviving a mean of 48 months after transplantation. Neither a second malignancy nor recurrence of the primary malignancy has been observed to date. The early results of heart transplantation for end-stage, radiation-induced heart disease are encouraging.
