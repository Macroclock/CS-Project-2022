Long-term small bowel allograft function induced by short-term FK 506 application is associated with split tolerance. Functional long-term allograft survival after experimental small bowel transplantation (SBT) is limited by chronic rejection. Initial application of high-dose FK 506 has been shown to induce stable long-term graft function. In order to examine whether this long-term function is associated with donor-specific tolerance, we analyzed the functional status of recipient T cells in vivo and in vitro. One-step orthotopic SBT was performed in the allogeneic Brown Norway (BN)-to-Lewis rat strain combination. FK 506 was given daily at a dose of 2 mg/kg from days 0-5 in the rejection model and from days 0-9 in the long-term functional model. Mean survival time in the rejection model was 98 +/- 2.8 days. Histological examination of these small bowel allografts disclosed signs of chronic rejection. In contrast, all animals of the long-term functional model survived long term (> 250 days) without clinical signs of chronic rejection. The latter model, furthermore, produced evidence of donor-specific tolerance. Whereas heterotopic Dark Agouti (DA) hearts were rejected regularly within 7 days, BN hearts survived indefinitely (> 70 days). In vitro, mixed leukocyte reactivity of CD4+ T cells was similarly strong against donor (BN) antigens as against third-party (DA) antigens. The split tolerance revealed by our in vivo and in vitro results enabled acceptance of both the small bowel allograft without signs of chronic rejection and of donor-specific heart allografts.
