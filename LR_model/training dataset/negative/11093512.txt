Normalization of native heart function years after heterotopic transplantation. We describe a patient whose native heart function has normalized several years after heterotopic heart transplantation. The native heart sustained the patient's circulation at a time when the donor heart was temporarily dysfunctional. Native heart improvement, let alone normalization, is considered rare after heterotopic transplantation but has been noted with increased frequency after long-term unloading with left ventricular assistance.
