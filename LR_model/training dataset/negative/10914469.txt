[Classical electrocardiography and the Wigner distribution in the detection of rejection of heart transplants]. Acute cardiac allograft rejection can be detected by the SA ECG only with intraindividual comparison of the recordings. Standard SA ECG parameters are not useful in the rejection detection and until now no absolute spectral parameter indicating acute rejection was discovered. Frequency analysis of the QRS complex is characterized by changes in the frequency spectra 70-110 Hz. The Wigner-Ville analysis provides new possibilities for frequency analysis and markers of acute and chronic cardiac allograft rejection using Wigner-Ville distribution are intensively studied.
