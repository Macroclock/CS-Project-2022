Ventricular remodeling of the native heart after heterotopic heart transplantation. Although ventricular remodeling after long-term unloading of the heart has been reported in patients after the use of medical therapy or left ventricular assist devices, it has rarely been reported in patients after heterotopic heart transplantation. Here, we describe a case of ventricular remodeling of the native heart after heterotopic heart transplantation. A 61-year-old man with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy underwent heterotopic heart transplantation because of high pulmonary vascular resistance and a small donor heart. After the operation, echocardiography showed ventricular remodeling of the native heart, with decreased size and improved contractility of the left ventricle. Six months after the transplantation, acute graft failure of the donor heart occurred. However, the patient remained in good condition with the support of the improved native heart.
