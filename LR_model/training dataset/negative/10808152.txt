Predictive factors and long-term evolution of early endothelial dysfunction after cardiac transplantation. Abnormal coronary vasomotion appears to be a common finding after heart transplantation (HTx). However, the pathophysiology and outcome of this functional disturbance remains poorly understood. Aims of the study were to determine the prevalence, predictive factors and long-term evolution of endothelial dysfunction after cardiac transplantation. The endothelium-dependent coronary vasomotion of 50 patients, who showed angiographically normal coronary arteries, were studied early (at 3 +/- 1 months) and at follow-up (16 +/- 5 months) after HTx. Endothelial function was studied by selective infusion of serial doses of acetylcholine (ACh) (10(-8), 10(-7)and 10(-6) mol/l) in the left anterior descending coronary artery. Changes in mean luminal diameter after the infusion of each dose were evaluated by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). At early study, 17 patients (34%) showed a vasoconstriction after maximal dose of ACh (-13.3 +/- 13%) indicative of endothelial dysfunction. Logistic regression analysis identified the following variables as independent predictors of early endothelial dysfunction: donor inotropic support (p = 0.004), female donor (p = 0.04) and rejection at the time of the study (p = 0.01). Forty-one patients were re-studied at follow-up. Nine of them (22%) presented endothelial dysfunction. Early endothelial dysfunction was restored in 6 patients (43%) at follow-up. The number of episodes of rejection was the only variable associated to late endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction is a common finding after cardiac transplantation. The pathogenesis of this functional disturbance appears to be donor-related and immune-mediated. The reversibility of this phenomenon observed at follow-up suggests the episodic nature of the immunologic injury.
