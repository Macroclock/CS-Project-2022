Ontogeny of antipig xenoantibody and hyperacute rejection. Neonatal primates have been reported to receive pig hearts without hyperacute rejection (HAR). We examined the ontogeny of the anti-pig xenoantibody (XenoAb) and HAR in the neonatal and infant monkeys. Twenty-six serum samples from 15 monkeys ages 14-192 days were subjected to hemagglutination titration against pig erythrocytes. Ten pig hearts were heterotopically transplanted into the monkeys. Six monkeys, ages 52-114 days, received pig hearts without HAR, and those ages 129-191 days hyperacutely rejected them. XenoAb titers were increased according to the age (Spearman's rank correlation value=0.909 (P<0.01)). XenoAb titers in 16 monkeys <4 months were significantly (P<0.01) lower than those in 10 monkeys >4 months. Anti-pig XenoAb titers increased with the age of the monkeys. XenoAb levels in monkeys >4 months are high enough to reject pig hearts hyperacutely.
