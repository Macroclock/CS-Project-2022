Cyclosporin A upregulates phospholipase C beta1 in fibroblasts from gingival overgrowth. In an attempt to evaluate the influence of cyclosporin A (CsA) on fibroblast metabolism, the phospholipase C beta1, (PLC beta1) nuclear expression was evaluated in fibroblasts from heart transplantation patients treated with CsA who exhibited gingival overgrowth (GO) and from controls. PLC beta1 was assessed by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry means. Findings did not show any difference in terms of PLC beta1 expression between the 2 groups when fibroblasts were incubated in media without CsA, while the addition of CsA highly stimulated the fibroblasts from CsA-treated patients compared to controls. The abnormal fibroblastic response in CsA-treated patients was detected both in cells from enlarged gingival sites and in cells from clinically healthy gingival sites. These results do not explain whether the exaggerated reactivity to in vitro CsA is the consequence of a genetically transmitted susceptibility to CsA that identifies those subjects at risk for developing GO, or whether it is a secondary effect of the long-term in vivo exposure to CsA. However, the present data underline the lack of any close relationship between enhanced fibroblast activity and clinical signs of GO and support the hypothesis that some other factors, together with CsA, are involved in the pathogenesis of CsA-induced GO.
