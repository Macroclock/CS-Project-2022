Fluvastatin decreases soluble thrombomodulin in cardiac transplant recipients. We conducted a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, cross-over study, to assess the effects of a 4-week fluvastatin therapy on plasma markers of endothelial activation or injury in 20 transplanted heart recipients. The levels of thrombomodulin and von Willebrand factor antigen were higher at baseline in cardiac transplant recipients than in age and sex-matched healthy controls. Plasma total cholesterol showed a 21% reduction on fluvastatin therapy (p = 0.0001). Fluvastatin treatment had no significant effect on creatininemia, plasma cyclosporine, PAI-1 antigen, PAI-1 activity, tPA antigen, and Von Willebrand factor. However, fluvastatin produced a significant decrease of plasma thrombomodulin (66.7 ng/ml on placebo versus 58.8 ng/ml on fluvastatin, p <0.001), suggesting a rapid improvement of endothelial injury in these patients.
