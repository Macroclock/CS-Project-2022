Cardiac MR spectroscopy in the new millennium. Spectroscopy is close to becoming an integral part of the clinical MR examination to achieve a complete morphological, functional, and metabolic evaluation of the human heart. 31P-NMR spectroscopy is used to noninvasively assess human myocardial energy metabolism. Abnormalities in the phosphocreatine (PCr) to ATP ratio are observed in ischemic heart disease, heart failure, transplanted hearts, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. NMR spectroscopy 31P spectra obtained at rest, during exercise or pharmacological stress allow the observation of the earliest metabolic responses of myocardial ischemia. 1 spectroscopy can evaluate the concentration of intracellular creatine and myocardial lipids as a means of evaluating myocardial viability. The increase in total 23Na in ischemic tissue provides information about the extent and location of viable tissue. Higher magnetic fields, gradient strength, and technological advances in pulse sequence and localization will result in better spatial and temporal resolution improving the clinical utility of the technique.
