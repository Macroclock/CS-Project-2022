Role of RANTES in experimental cardiac allograft rejection. The host response to alloantigen results in upregulation of Class II MHC antigens and associated cytokine production (especially IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)) as well as lymphocytic infiltration and cellular activation which leads to graft damage/destruction. RANTES (Regulated upon Activation, Normal T-cell Expressed and presumably Secreted) is a member of the beta subfamily (CC) of chemokines and has been shown to function as a lymphocyte chemoattractant. We now describe the requirement for RANTES in cardiac heterotopic allograft (brown Norway into Lewis rats) rejection in rats. By Northern blot analysis, mRNA could be detected in allografts at 6 and 8 days post-transplantation but not in isogenic (Lewis) grafts. RANTES protein could be demonstrated by Western blot analysis in homogenates from allografts at day 8 but not at day 0 and could not be identified in isogenic cardiac transplants. By immunostaining, RANTES protein was present in mononuclear cells of allografts at day 6 but was absent in the isogenic transplants. When rats were treated with anti-RANTES serum, there was a significant delay in rejection time (cessation of beating) of the allografts. These data demonstrate that expression of RANTES in rat cardiac allografts is linked to the rejection phenomenon.
