Cardiac transplantation following a 24-h preservation using a perfusion apparatus. We developed a new apparatus for heart preservation and have already reported successful transplantation following 12 h of preservation using this apparatus. The efficacy of coronary perfusion with an oxygenated Celsior solution was investigated through transplantation following 24 h of preservation using the apparatus. After being harvested, grafts were preserved with a combination of immersion in a 4 degrees C Celsior solution and perfusion with an oxygenated Celsior solution using the apparatus in the coronary perfusion (CP) group and simply immersed in a 4 degrees C Celsior solution in the simple immersion(SI) group. beta-Adenosine triphosphate (beta-ATP), phosphocreatine (Pcr), and inorganic phosphate (P(i)) levels and myocardial pH (pH(i)) were measured immediately after the heart was excised and at 12 and 24 h after preservation. Following preservation, orthotopic transplantation was performed. Cardiac function was measured 2 h after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). beta-ATP/P(i), Pcr/P(i), and pH(i) levels were significantly higher in the CP group than in the SI group at 12 and 24 h after preservation. Four of six animals in the CP group and two of six in the SI group were successfully weaned from CPB. The recovery rates of cardiac function were better in the CP group than in the SI group. Twenty-four hours of heart preservation may be possible with a combination of immersion in a 4 degrees C Celsior solution and perfusion with an oxygenated Celsior solution using the perfusion apparatus.
