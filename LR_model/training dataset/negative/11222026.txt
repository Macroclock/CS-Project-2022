Hypothermic storage of coronary endothelial cells reduces nitric oxide synthase activity and expression. Preservation with University of Wisconsin (UW) solution has been implicated in coronary artery endothelial damage and loss of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of this solution on basal nitric oxide (NO) release from porcine coronary endothelial cells (CEC). Cultures were exposed to cold (4 degrees C) storage in UW solution for 6, 8 and 12 h. Parallel cultures were incubated with control medium at 37 degrees C. After treatment, NO release was evaluated by nitrite production, a stable metabolite of NO. Activity of the constitutive endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was measured by the conversion [3H]-l-arginine to [3H]-l-citrulline and eNOS protein expression by Western blotting. Nitrite production by control cells was augmented with increasing times of incubation, whereas no change was observed in those cultures preserved with UW solution. Activity of eNOS was significantly decreased compared to the respective control group by cold storage of cells for longer periods than 6 h. Such decrease was correlated with a diminished eNOS protein expression in CEC preserved with UW solution after 8- and 12-h storage. These results suggest that prolonged hypothermic storage of CEC with UW solution does not preserve basal NO release because of a certain loss of eNOS protein, which may contribute to the reported injury of heart transplants after long-term preservation.
