Use of complementary therapies, adherence, and quality of life in lung transplant recipients. The purpose of this study was to describe complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use by lung transplant patients and to determine whether CAM users differ from nonusers with respect to health status, quality of life, or medical adherence. A mailed survey seeking CAM, quality of life, and adherence information was sent to 145 lung transplant recipients, and 99 responded. The majority (88%) used at least 1 form of CAM (median, 2; range, 0-17). Prayer (68%), support groups (43%), and relaxation techniques (31%) were the most common. Only 44% of users reported discussing CAM with their providers. CAM users were adherent to their transplant regimen. Few differences were found between CAM users and nonusers. Education, high symptom burden, female sex, and depression symptoms were associated with various types of CAM use. Most lung transplant recipients are using CAM. Providers must explore potential for interaction or enhancement between CAM and standard therapy to optimize care.
