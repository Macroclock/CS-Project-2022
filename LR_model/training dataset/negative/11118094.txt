Risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer in Italian organ transplant recipients. A registry-based study. Organ transplant recipients are at an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer. Few data concern heart transplantation and populations from southern Europe. A total of 1,329 patients who received their first kidney (1,062 subjects) or heart allograft (267 subjects) were included in a partly retrospective cohort study to evaluate the risk of skin cancer. The incidence rate per 1,000 person-years and the cumulative incidence were computed. Standardized morbidity ratio was estimated by comparison with Italian cancer registry data. To analyze the role of potential prognostic factors, Cox's regression method was used. The overall incidence rate of nonmelanoma skin cancer was 10.0 cases per 1,000 posttransplant person-years (95% confidence interval 8.2-11.7). This estimate was far higher than expected in the general population. The overall risk of developing skin cancer increased from a cumulative incidence of 5.8% after 5 posttransplant years to an incidence of 10.8% after 10 years of graft survival. In a Cox proportional hazard risk model, the most important factors that appeared to favor the development of skin cancer were age at transplantation and sex. After adjustment for age at transplantation and sex, no definite increased risk was documented among heart as compared with kindney transplant recipients. Our study confirms the increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer among organ transplant recipients in a southern European population.
