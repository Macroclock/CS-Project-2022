[Cardiogenic shock complicating extensive infarction with ventricular septal defect. Circulatory assistance and heart transplantation]. A 47 year old man had a massive anterior myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock with a left parasternal murmur. Coronary angiography showed occlusion of the left anterior descending artery for which angioplasty resulted in failure. There was antero-lateral-apical akinesia and a ventricular septal defect (VSD) with a left-right shunt (Qp/Qs = 1.54). Persistence and aggravation of haemodynamic instability led to intra-aortic balloon pumping with inotropic pharmacological support followed by biventricular assistance with a MEDOS device. Under transoesophageal echocardiographic monitoring, the outcome was marked over 7 days by the progressive increase in the shunt volume of the VSD, a decrease of drainage and injection flow, progressive increase in spontaneous contrast echos followed by the presence of fibrin in the cardiac chambers and canulae, the presence of thrombus in the external ventricles, blockage of the right external valve which only opened after increasing the degree of anticoagulation, and, finally, cardiac tamponade which required drainage before the patient's state improved. On the 8th day, the patient being stable with a normal neurological status, the availability of a donor heart led to the decision to transplant, which was carried out without complications. This case poses the problem of cardiac assist devices and their daily monitoring, and then that of cardiac transplantation in this indication.
