Heart preservation in HTK solution: role of coronary vasculature in recovery of cardiac function. Poor myocardial tolerance to prolonged cold ischemia remains a major concern in heart transplantation. In this study, we estimated superiority of Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate (HTK) over University of Wisconsin (UW) as a cardiac preservation solution. Isolated rat hearts were mounted on a Langendorff apparatus to estimate the baseline cardiac function. The hearts were arrested and stored at 4 degrees C in UW and HTK solution for 8 hours, and then reperfused. The aortic flow, coronary flow, cardiac output, rate pressure product, and left ventricular dp/dt in the HTK group recovered significantly more than the UW group. The values of myocardial total adenine nucleotides and the adenosine triphosphate to adenosine diphosphate ratio were higher in the HTK than in the UW group. We also examined coronary vascular responsiveness using left coronary arteries dissected from the rat hearts before flushing, before storage, after storage, and after reperfusion. The maximal relaxation response to acetylcholine was significantly higher in the HTK than in the UW group after reperfusion, although there were no significant differences at each stage before reperfusion. In addition, the endothelium-independent relaxation response to sodium nitroprusside in the HTK group was also well preserved after reperfusion. These results indicate that HTK is superior to UW solution for cardiac preservation. HTK protects coronary vasculature during preservation, which together with reperfusion might lead to improved functional cardiac recovery following preservation.
