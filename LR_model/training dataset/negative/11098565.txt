[Advances and perspectives in mechanical heart assist]. Mechanical circulatory support devices were first developed to permanently replace the failing heart. Today, however, the majority of these devices are used as a mechanical bridge in patients awaiting heart transplantation. With this indication, important information on using mechanical assist devices has been assembled. We present our experience, which has been gained since 1987 in the area of patient selection, post-implant patient care and device maintenance. More than 450 patients have since been implanted with assist devices at our institution. Mechanical circulatory support may not only lead to recovery from secondary organ failure, but also to myocardial remodeling and recovery of the heart function in some patients. Additionally we report our experience with a newly developed implantable axial flow pump and discuss the possibility and costs of permanent support in some patients.
