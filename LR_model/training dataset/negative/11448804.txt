Association of parvovirus B19 with plasma cell-rich myocardial infiltrates after heart transplantation. In this report we describe the development of plasma cell-rich myocardial infiltrates in association with a parvovirus B19 infection in a heart transplant patient. We hypothesize that the virus, either alone or in association with the cardiac allograft, may polarize the immune response in the direction of T helper 2 (Th2) cells rather than the expected Th1 cells. This favors the development of a humoral immune response and infiltration of the graft with plasma cells.
