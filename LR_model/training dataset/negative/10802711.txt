The axis of interleukin 12 and gamma interferon regulates acute vascular xenogeneic rejection. Recent advances using transgenic animals or exogenous complement inhibitors have demonstrated prevention of hyperacute rejection of vascularized organs, but not graft loss due to acute vascular rejection. Using various wild-type and cytokine-deficient mice strains, we have examined the mechanisms of acute vascular rejection. C57BL/6 mice deficient in interleukin12 or gamma interferon showed faster acute vascular rejection than did wild-type mice. Furthermore, mice defective in B-cell development showed no acute vascular rejection. These results demonstrate that the axis of interleukin 12 and gamma interferon provides a survival advantage in vascularized xenografts by delaying or preventing acute vascular rejection caused by a B cell-dependent mechanism.
