Viral IL-10-induced immunosuppression requires Th2 cytokines and impairs APC function within the allograft. Previous reports demonstrated that retroviral mediated gene transfer of viral IL-10 (vIL-10) prolongs allograft survival by decreasing donor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor (CTLp) and IL-2-secreting helper T lymphocyte precursor (HTLp) frequency within graft-infiltrating cells (GIC). This report now shows that vIL-10 efficacy is dependent on CD4(+) T cells, suggesting that immunosuppression may involve a switch from a Th1 to a Th2 alloresponse. In support of this, anti-IL-4 or anti-murine IL-10 (anti-mIL-10) mAbs, but not anti-IFN-gamma mAb, administered at the time of vIL-10 gene transfer prevents enhanced graft survival. Because Th switching involves APC function, GIC were examined for their ability to present alloantigen. GIC from vIL-10-treated grafts were shown to be mostly of recipient (CBA) origin, yet were unable to elicit alloproliferative responses from donor type (C57BL/6) or third party (BALB/c) responders. The inability of vIL-10-treated GIC to stimulate the MLR was not due to the generation of negative regulatory cells or the production of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-4, mIL-10, or TGFbeta. Using fractionated GIC subpopulations, the number of recipient type cells in the allografts was modestly reduced by vIL-10 gene transfer, while maintaining both APC phenotype and alloantigen presenting function. Conversely, after vIL-10 gene transfer, donor type GIC were unable to participate in direct alloantigen presentation. Therefore, local immunosuppression induced by vIL-10 gene transfer is CD4 T cell and IL-4 and mIL-10 dependent, and impairs direct alloantigen presentation through an alteration of donor type APC function.
