[Brain death and intensive care medicine. The cultural history of a medical concept]. The paper focuses on the cultural history of brain death in Germany in the second half of the 20th century. It analyzes scientific and public discourses on the relevance of brain death and the importance of medical innovations in intensive care medicine. The paper examines how the public reacted when heart transplantation led to an urgent need for a new definition of death. It will be shown how the concept of brain death was accepted by the public, introduced into clinical routine, and implemented through medical and legal policies. Finally, it will be analyzed why the public consensus on brain death was definitely questioned in the last ten years. An understanding of the use of the concept of brain death by scientists, lawyers, theologians, and the public during the last three decades may help to shed light on the social role of science in modern and late-modern societies.
