Viremia and excretion of TT virus in immunosuppressed heart transplant recipients and in immunocompetent individuals. The TT virus (TTV) was discovered in patients with symptomatic posttransfusion hepatitis, but many viremic individuals are asymptomatic. Inadvertent transfusion-associated transmission must therefore be anticipated. We screened blood donors and heart transplant recipients for TTV infections. Nested polymerase chain reaction was used to detect TTV DNA in plasma, serum, urine, and fecal samples from 600 blood donors, from 100 healthy individuals, and from 495 heart transplant recipients. A total of 3.2% of the blood donors, but 25% of the heart transplant recipients were viremic. TTV subtypes G1a/b and G2a/b were observed in both groups, but the subtype distributions were discrepant. A severe, acute infection with TTV subtype 3 was observed in one blood donor. The prevalence of TTV infections in heart transplant recipients was not correlated to transfusion frequency. Nine viremic heart transplant recipients and their 75 blood donors were studied in detail. Seven blood donors were viremic, but only two "pairs" of viremic blood donors and transfusion recipients had identical TTV isolates. TTV DNA was detected in the feces of 5% (5/100) of immunocompetent individuals (staff), in 46% (52/112) of viremic heart transplant recipients, and in the urine of 55% (20/36). TTV DNA was detected in six of six batches of pooled "virus-inactivated" plasma (solvent/detergent treated), and in none of eight batches of commercial immunoglobulins. Although TTV is transfusion-transmissible, the parenteral transmission rate may have been overestimated. Many TTV infections are apparently acquired by nonparenteral routes. Immunoglobulins are safe but pooled plasma is not safe regarding TTV transmission.
