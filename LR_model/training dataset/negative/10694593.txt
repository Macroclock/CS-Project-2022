Sirolimus, a new potent immunosuppressant agent for refractory cardiac transplantation rejection: two case reports. Rejection remains a major cause of both early and late morbidity and mortality following heart transplantation despite major advances in immunosuppressive therapy. A major hurdle in the successful management of patients who have undergone heart transplantation is preventing and treating graft rejection. Cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, tacrolimus (FK506) and OKT3 are well documented, effective immunosuppressive medications that prevent and treat acute or chronic rejection following heart transplantation. One of the macrolide antibiotics, sirolimus, is known to have immunosuppressant activity. In two patients with chronic rejection of cardiac grafts refractory to usual antirejection medications, sirolimus was successfully used to suppress graft rejection. Both patients continued to be rejection free after 10 months of sirolimus treatment despite significant decreases in doses of other immunosuppressants.
