Sleep apnea in heart transplant recipients: type, symptoms, risk factors, and response to nasal continuous positive airway pressure. We determined the type, symptoms, and risk factors for sleep apnea in heart transplant recipients and the response to nasal continuous positive airway pressure. A retrospective study on heart transplant recipients with sleep apnea was conducted in a tertiary care medical center with follow-up telephone interviews. Between February 1988 and August 1998, 147 patients underwent orthotopic heart transplantation at our institution. Seventeen patients (11.6%) who were suspected of having sleep apnea underwent polysomnography at a mean interval of 17.5 months after transplantation. All were diagnosed with sleep apnea: 13 had obstructive sleep apnea and 4 had mixed sleep apnea. Mean age at polysomnography was 50.8 years (range, 24-67 years). The patients presented with snoring (100%), excessive daytime somnolence (65%), witnessed apneas (53%), and morning fatigue (53%). Sixteen (94%) had a mean weight gain of 10.4 kg after transplantation, and 1 patient lost 14.6 kg. In the 11 patients with obstructive sleep apnea who underwent nasal continuous positive airway pressure titration, significant improvements occurred in the apnea-hypopnea index (decreased from 37.6 to 10.4; p = 0.01) and mean arousal index (decreased from 44.5 to 19.4; p = 0.01). Only 2 of the 8 patients with sleep apnea for whom nasal continuous positive airway pressure was recommended continued to use it at the time of telephone follow-up. Sleep apnea, especially obstructive sleep apnea, occurs frequently in heart transplant recipients. Obstructive sleep apnea appears to present in the typical manner, and although a positive response to nasal continuous positive airway pressure can be documented by polysomnography, long-term use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure may be low.
