Impaired exercise parameters in pediatric heart transplant recipients: comparison of biatrial and bicaval techniques. The exercise performance of pediatric heart transplant recipients and the effects of bicaval anastomosis were studied in 19 children using a Bruce protocol. Although all children had decreased exercise capacity and heart rates when compared with normals, the bicaval anastomosis patients had similar endurance and peak heart rates as the standard biatrial group.
