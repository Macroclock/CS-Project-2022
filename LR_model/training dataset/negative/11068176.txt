Myocardial carnitine and carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiencies in patients with severe heart failure. We studied myocardial tissue from 25 cardiac transplant recipients, who had end-stage congestive heart failure (CHF), and from 21 control donor hearts. Concentrations of total carnitine (TC), free carnitine (FC), short-chain acylcarnitines, long-chain acylcarnitines (LCAC) as well as carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) activities were measured in myocardial tissue homogenates and referred to the concentration of non-collagen protein. Compared to controls, the concentrations of TC and FC as well as total CPT activities were significantly lower in patients. LCAC levels and the LCAC to FC ratio values were significantly greater in patients than in controls. While the malonyl-CoA sensitive fraction of CPT, which represents CPT I activity, was similar in patients and controls, the residual CPT activity after inhibition by malonyl-CoA, representing CPT II activity, was significantly reduced in patients compared to controls. Moreover, the activity of CPT in the presence of Triton X-100, which also represents the activity of CPT II, was significantly lower in patients than in controls. Malonyl-CoA concentrations required for half-maximal inhibition of CPT activity were significantly greater in patients than in controls. There was a linear relationship between ejection fraction (EF) values and concentrations of TC, FC, or total CPT activities. Values for LCAC and the LCAC to FC ratio were inversely related to EF values. We conclude that failing heart shows decreased total CPT and CPT II activities and carnitine deficiency that may be related to ventricle function.
