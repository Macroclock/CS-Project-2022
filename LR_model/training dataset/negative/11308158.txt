Successful cardiac transplantation with methanol or carbon monoxide-poisoned donors. Patients succumbing to methanol or carbon monoxide poisoning are usually rejected for heart donation. Increasing demand for donors has lead to the expansion of acceptance criteria and increased use of the marginal donor. We transplanted hearts from donors who had had methanol intoxication in three cases and carbon monoxide exposure in two cases. Standard donor evaluation criteria and transplantation techniques were used. All of the transplants were successful. Three of the recipients required significant inotropic support for a few days postoperatively; however, all of the hearts functioned well over the intermediate and long term. Two recipients (1 from each group) died of complications other than heart failure (1.5 and 2 years postoperatively). Successful heart transplantation can be achieved using the hearts from patients succumbing to methanol or carbon monoxide poisoning. Routine evaluation of cardiac function and myocardial damage is adequate for screening these donors. Hearts from methanol-poisoning victims may require longer inotropic support postoperatively before complete recovery, but can provide excellent long-term function and results.
