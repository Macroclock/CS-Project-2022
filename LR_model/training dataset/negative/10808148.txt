Prognostic value of serum cytokines in patients with congestive heart failure. Increased levels of circulating cytokines have been previously reported in patients with congestive heart failure; however, whether they have prognostic implications is still unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic implications of elevated serum cytokines in patients with heart failure and to identify the predictors of cytokine activation. We assessed neurohormonal determinations, circulating cytokines, ejection fraction (EF) and end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular lengths in 87 patients (aged 57 +/- 9 years) with left ventricular dysfunction (EF 24% +/- 6%). In 48 patients, we also assessed cytokine receptors. During follow-up (mean, 14 +/- 9 months), 8 patients died and 12 had new heart failure episodes that required hospital admission, 5 of whom underwent heart transplantation. The univariate predictors of these events were serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) (p = 0.00001), New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (p = 0.0004), tumor necrosis factor-soluble receptor I (p = 0. 001), atrial natriuretic peptide (p = 0.002), tumor necrosis factor-soluble receptor II (p = 0.004), angiotensin II (p = 0.006), serum interleukin-1 beta (p = 0.01), and plasma renin activity (p = 0.02). Increased serum interleukin-6 (>10 pg/ml) was a significant predictor of death or new heart failure episodes according to the Kaplan-Meier survival method by log-rank test (p = 0.004). By Cox regression analysis, serum IL-6 (p = 0.0005) and the NYHA functional class (p = 0.005) were identified as independent predictors of prognosis. In patients with congestive heart failure, increased serum IL-6 was identified as a powerful independent predictor of the combined end point: death, new heart failure episodes, and need for heart transplantation.
