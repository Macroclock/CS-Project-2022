Differential effects of cyclosporine A, methylprednisolone, mycophenolate, and rapamycin on CD154 induction and requirement for NFkappaB: implications for tolerance induction. Recent experimental data indicate that the targeting of the costimulatory molecule CD40-ligand (CD154) may well offer an opportunity for tolerance induction in transplant recipients and patients with autoimmune diseases, although the optimal therapeutic strategy for clinical application of CD154 monoclonal antibody (mAb) is unclear. We undertook vascularized heterotopic cardiac allograft transplantation in completely MHC-mismatched mice, treated recipients with CD154 mAb plus various immunosuppressive agents, and performed flow cytometric analysis of CD154 expression by T cells activated in vitro in the presence of corresponding immunosuppressive agents. We also tested the extent to which CD154 induction was NFkappaB-dependent by using NFkappaB/p50-deficient mice as allograft recipients and as source of cells for in vitro studies of CD154 induction, and through use of proteasome inhibitors to block IkappaBalpha degradation and NFKB activation in wild-type mice. Concomitant use of cyclosporin A or methylprednisolone, but not rapamycin or mycophenolate, inhibited CD154 mAb-induced allograft survival. The differential effects of these agents on CD154 mAb-induced tolerance correlated with their capacity to inhibit activation-induced CD154 expression on CD4+ T cells. Full expression of CD154 expression was found to require NF-kappaB activation, and CD154 mAb was ineffective in NF-kappaB/p50 deficient allograft recipients or control mice in which NF-kappaB activation was blocked by proteasome inhibition. Strategies to use CD154 mAb clinically must take into account the effects of immunosuppressive agents on CD154 induction, which seems to be at least partially NF-kappaB dependent. Our data suggest that ligation of surface-expressed CD154 provides an important signal that modulates T cell activation and thereby contributes to the effects of CD154 mAb, in addition to previously recognized actions involving blockade of CD40/CD154-dependent cell activation and activation-induced cell death.
