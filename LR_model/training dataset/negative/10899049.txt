Short-term variability of pulse pressure and systolic and diastolic time in heart transplant recipients. In heart transplant recipients (HTR), short-term systolic blood pressure variability is preserved, whereas heart rate variability is almost abolished. Heart period is the sum of left ventricular ejection time (LVET) and diastolic time (DT). In the present time-domain prospective study, we tested the hypothesis that short-term fluctuations in aortic pulse pressure (PP) in HTR were related to fluctuations in LVET. Seventeen male HTR (age 48 +/- 6 yr) were studied 16 +/- 11 mo after transplantation. Aortic root pressure was obtained over a 15-s period using a micromanometer both at rest (n = 17) and following the cold pressor test (CPT, n = 14). There was a strong positive linear relationship between beat-to-beat LVET and beat-to-beat PP in all patients at rest and in 13 of 14 patients following CPT (each P < 0.01). The slope of this relationship showed little scatter both at rest (0.34 +/- 0.07 mmHg/ms) and following CPT (0.35 +/- 0.09 mmHg/ms, P = not significant). Given the essentially fixed heart period, DT varied inversely with LVET. As a result, in 13 of 17 HTR at rest and in 12 of 14 HTR following CPT, there was a negative linear relationship between beat-to-beat PP and DT. In conclusion, our short-term time-domain study demonstrated a strong positive linear relationship between LVET and blood pressure variability in male HTR. We also identified a subgroup of HTR in whom there was a mismatch between PP and DT.
