Endothelin and cardiac transplantation. Endothelins are 21 amino acid peptides that are produced ubiquitously by vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and other cells in different organs. Endothelins are secreted as big-endothelins that are converted to active proteins by the endothelin-converting enzyme. These peptides possess many biological activities, such as vasoconstriction and mitogenesis, and are involved in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes in humans. Elevated plasma levels of endothelin have been associated with heart failure, and increased immunoreactivity for endothelin is observed in transplant coronary artery disease. In this brief review, we will discuss the regulation of endothelin in cardiac transplantation and the pathological role this peptide plays in renal impairment, systemic hypertension, graft rejection and arteriosclerosis after heart transplantation.
