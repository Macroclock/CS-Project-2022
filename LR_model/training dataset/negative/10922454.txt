Evaluation of a noninvasive index of global ventricular function to predict rejection after pediatric cardiac transplantation. A Doppler myocardial performance index, defined as the sum of the isovolumetric contraction and relaxation time divided by the ejection time (ICT + IRT/ET), reflects global cardiac function, and when applied to the left ventricle, may serve as a predictor of moderate rejection in pediatric cardiac transplant patients.
