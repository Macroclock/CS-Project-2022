Inducible expression of basic transcription factor-binding protein 2 (BTEB2), a member of zinc finger family of transcription factors, in cardiac allograft vascular disease. We have recently identified basic transcription factor-binding protein 2 (BTEB2), which is involved in phenotypic modulation of vascular vascular smooth muscle cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of BTEB2 in cardiac allograft vascular disease. Heterotopic cardiac transplantation was performed in rats. All grafts were stained with antibodies against for BTEB2 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 for immunohistochemical study. The intensity of BTEB2 expression was also calculated. In the allografts at 4 and 8 weeks after transplantation, smooth muscle cells were positive for BTEB2 in the diffusely thickened coronary arteries and the perivascular space. BTEB2 expression was closely associated with cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expression. The BTEB2 expression score was significantly higher in the allografts compared with the isografts. The induced expression of BTEB2 may play a potential role in the development of the cardiac allograft vascular disease.
