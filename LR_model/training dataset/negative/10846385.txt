[Intraoperative management of heart transplantation in Japan--report of two cases]. We experienced intraoperative anesthetic management of two cases of heart transplantation in Japan. Both patients were in the end stage of cardiac failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy. One patient had had implantation of left ventricular assist system, and another patient had had implantation of automated cardioveter defibrillator. Transesophageal echocardiography was useful for the monitoring of cardiac function during the operation. Anti-arrythmic therapy including heart pacing and protection of right heart failure are important for the circulatory management of heart transplantation. The anesthesiologist is needed not only for the management of respiration and circulation but also for the prevention of infection and control of the time schedule.
