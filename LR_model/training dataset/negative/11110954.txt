Changes in calcaneal trabecular bone structure after heart transplantation: an MR imaging study. To use high-spatial-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to analyze the trabecular bone structure of the calcaneus in patients before and after heart transplantation and to compare this technique with bone mineral density (BMD) measurement in predicting therapy-induced bone loss and vertebral fracture status. High-spatial-resolution 1.5-T MR imaging of the calcaneus was performed in 40 men 11-120 months after heart transplantation, in 11 men before heart transplantation, and in 10 age-matched male volunteers. Sagittal and transverse T1-weighted spin-echo images with a voxel size of 0.195 x 0.195 x 1.000 mm were obtained, and structure measurements analogous to bone histomorphometric values were calculated. In addition, the BMD of the lumbar spine was determined in the transplant recipients pre- and postoperatively by using quantitative computed tomography, and vertebral fracture status was assessed. Significant differences in structure and BMD measurements were found between patients before and after heart transplantation (P <. 05). In 17 (42%) of 40 transplant recipients, vertebral fractures were found. Although structure measurements were significantly different between patients with and those without fractures (P <.05), BMDs were not. Correlations between time after transplantation and some structure measurements were moderately significant (P <. 05), but such correlations with BMD measurements were not. MR imaging-derived structure measurements in the calcaneus are useful for monitoring bone changes after heart transplantation and assessing vertebral fracture status.
