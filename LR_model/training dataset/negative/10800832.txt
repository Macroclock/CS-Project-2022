Successful myocardial volume reduction in a 9-month-old infant. Left ventricular reduction has shown promise as a treatment for end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy, with restoration of the physiologic ratio between myocardial mass and left ventricular diameter. We present a case of successful partial left ventriculectomy utilizing both lateral and septal wall excision as treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy in a 9-month-old patient.
