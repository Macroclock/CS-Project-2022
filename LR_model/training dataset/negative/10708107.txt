Chylomicron metabolism in patients submitted to cardiac transplantation. Development of coronary graft disease is the most important cause of late heart graft failure. Alterations in plasma lipid profile are frequent in heart transplant (HT) patients, but they seem not to be prominent. Currently, the metabolism of chylomicrons, the lipoproteins that carry dietary lipids absorbed by the intestine, was evaluated because chylomicron remnants are considered atherogenic. An emulsion labeled with 3H-triolein and 14C-cholesteryl oleate and known to mimic the metabolic behavior of chylomicrons was injected intravenously after a 12-hr fast into 34 HT patients, 24 patients with end-stage heart failure (ESHF), and 30 healthy normolipidemic subjects. The plasma disappearance curves of the radioisotopes were determined from blood samples collected over 1 hr. In some of the patients and in controls, in vitro postheparin lipolytic activity was measured and an oral fat load test with postprandial measurement of triglyceridemia was performed. Fractional clearance rate (in m(-1), median [25%; 75%]) of both emulsion 3H-triolein and 14C-cholesteryl oleate was extremely diminished in HT patients (HT: 0.0114 [0.0114; 0.0179] and 0.2x10(-8) [0.2x10(-8); 0.0041, respectively]; ESHF: 0.0226 [0.0223; 0.0568] and 0.0160 [0.0055; 0.0189]; control subjects: 0.0270 [0.0226; 0.0392] and 0.0090 [0.0042; 0.0180], respectively, P<0.05). HT patients also had reduced postheparin lipolysis and marked elevation of postprandial triglyceridemia compared with the controls. HT patients develop accumulation in the plasma of chylomicrons and their remnants. The observed alterations were so intense that they may suggest an important involvement of atherogenic chylomicron remnants in coronary graft disease.
