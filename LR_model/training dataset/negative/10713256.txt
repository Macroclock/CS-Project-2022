Long-term assessment of heart rate variability in cardiac transplant recipients. Sympathetic and parasympathetic reinnervation of the transplanted heart were evaluated by assessing time and frequency domain measurements of heart rate variability at 5 and 8 years. Continuous 24-hour ECG measurements were performed in 13 patients (57 +/- 6 months and 90 +/- 7 months) after orthotopic cardiac transplantation and in 22 healthy age and gender-matched controls, and were analyzed for heart rate variability in the time and frequency domains. Heart rate variability measures reflective of sympathetic reinnervation were sub-normal at 5 years and unchanged at 8 years: those reflective of parasympathetic reinnervation were absent.
