Heart failure etiology affects peripheral vascular endothelial function after cardiac transplantation. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of heart failure etiology on peripheral vascular endothelial function in cardiac transplant recipients. Peripheral vascular endothelial dysfunction occurs in patients with heart failure of either ischemic or nonischemic etiology. The effect of heart failure etiology on peripheral endothelial function after cardiac transplantation is unknown. Using brachial artery ultrasound, endothelium-dependent, flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was assessed in patients with heart failure with either nonischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 10) or ischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 7), cardiac transplant recipients with prior nonischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 10) or prior ischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 10) and normal controls (n = 10). Patients with heart failure with either ischemic cardiomyopathy or nonischemic cardiomyopathy had impaired FMD (3.6 +/- 1.0% and 5.1 +/- 1.2%, respectively, p = NS) compared with normal subjects (13.9 +/- 1.3%, p < 0.01 compared with either heart failure group). In transplant recipients with antecedent nonischemic cardiomyopathy, FMD was markedly higher than that of heart failure patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (13.0 +/- 2.4%, p < 0.001) and similar to that of normal subjects (p = NS). However, FMD remained impaired in transplant recipients with prior ischemic cardiomyopathy (5.5 +/- 1.5%, p = 0.001 compared with normal, p = 0.002 vs. transplant recipients with previous nonischemic cardiomyopathy). Peripheral vascular endothelial function is normal in cardiac transplant recipients with antecedent nonischemic cardiomyopathy, but remains impaired in those with prior ischemic cardiomyopathy. In contrast, endothelial function is uniformly abnormal for patients with heart failure, regardless of etiology. These findings indicate that cardiac transplantation corrects peripheral endothelial function for patients without ischemic heart disease, but not in those with prior atherosclerotic coronary disease.
