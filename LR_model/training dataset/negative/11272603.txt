Survival after acute graft failure in pediatric thoracic organ transplant recipients. Survival among recipients of repeat thoracic organ transplantation, particularly in the setting of acute graft failure (AGF), is lower than survival after a primary transplant. This has created controversy over the fair allocation of scarce organs. We reviewed our experience to assess the effectiveness of aggressive therapy and retransplantation in pediatric patients with AGF. Between November 1994 and March 1998, 52 patients aged 49 days to 16.9 years (median age 4.7 years) underwent thoracic organ transplantation (32 primary and 4 repeat heart, 16 primary and 4 repeat lung, and 3 primary heart-lung transplants). Acute graft failure occurred in nine (4 heart, 3 lung, 2 heart-lung transplants), six of whom were supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and four of whom underwent repeat transplant. Six of the nine survived, including all of those who were retransplanted, and five of the nine were alive 1 year later. The average postoperative hospital stay after receiving a second organ was 46.5 days vs. a postoperative 22-day stay in recipients without AGF (p = 0.07). We conclude that the decision to allocate institutional and professional resources to the aggressive support of patients with AGF must be made at the level of the individual transplant center. However, we feel that the outcome of aggressive support and retransplantation justifies the allocation of organs to these patients and suggests that the current policies governing organ allocation for patients with early graft failure should be re-examined.
