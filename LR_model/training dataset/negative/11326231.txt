Partial left ventriculectomy for dilated cardiomyopathy: is this an alternative to transplantation? To determine the late effectiveness of partial left ventriculectomy and risk factors for failure. Between May 1996 and December 1998, partial left ventriculectomy and concomitant mitral valve surgery were performed in 62 patients (95% transplant candidates) with a mean age of 54 years (range 17-72 years). All patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III (38%) or IV (62%) because of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (59 patients) or ischemic, valvular, or familial cardiomyopathy (1 patient each). Outcomes considered for multivariable analysis included implantation of left ventricular assist device, return to class IV heart failure, relisting for transplantation, and death. Partial left ventriculectomy reduced the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter immediately preoperatively to immediately postoperatively (from 8.4 +/- 1.1 cm to 5.92 +/- 0.8 cm; P =.01), reduced the left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (from 133 +/- 48.6 mL to 64.1 +/- 26 mL; P <.0001), and increased the left ventricular ejection fraction (from 16 +/- 7.6 to 31.5 +/- 10.9; P <.0001). Survival was 80% and 60% at 1 and 3 years after surgery and freedom from failure was 49% and 26%, respectively. Increased systolic pulmonary artery pressure, decreased maximum exercise oxygen consumption, and increased left atrial pressure were associated with failure and/or death. The degree of preoperative mitral regurgitation did not correlate with clinical outcome. Early and late failures preclude the widespread use of partial left ventriculectomy. However, in view of its sometimes beneficial effect, use in situations that do not allow for transplantation or as a biologic bridge to transplantation may be appropriate.
