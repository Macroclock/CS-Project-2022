Reversal of protein-losing enteropathy in a child with Fontan circulation is correlated with central venous pressure after heart transplantation. We report on the reversal of protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) after heart transplantation (HTx) in a 10-yr-old boy with Fontan circulation, previously treated unsuccessfully with heparin for several months. The protein loss continued immediately after the Tx. During the following month, however, a gradual decrease in protein loss was observed, which correlated with a decrease in the inferior vena cava (IVC) pressure. The patient is doing well with a normal serum albumin level and a normal IVC pressure, 2 yr after Tx.
