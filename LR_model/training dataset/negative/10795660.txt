Removal of Foscarnet by hemodialysis using dialysate-side values. Foscarnet is an antiviral agent widely used in the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. We describe a cardiac transplant patient, who while being maintained with hemodialysis because of tobramycin-induced acute renal failure, was given Foscarnet for disseminated CMV infection. Using dialysate-side clearance methodology, we found the dialyzer clearance of Foscarnet to be in the order of 89 ml/min.
