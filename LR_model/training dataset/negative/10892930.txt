Milrinone for long-term pharmacologic support of the status 1 heart transplant candidates. We determined the efficacy of long-term therapy with milrinone alone or in combination with inotropic agents in status 1 heart transplant candidates as a pharmacological support until heart transplantation. Hemodynamic and biochemical variables were recorded in 29 status 1 men with symptoms of severe congestive heart failure, who received continuous intravenous milrinone alone (group 1, n = 21) or in combination with inotropic agents (group 2, n = 8) while awaiting heart transplantation. Symptomatic relief was noted in all patients of both groups without any preoperative deaths. One patient (4.8%) of group 1 died on the second day and 1 patient of group 2 died 16.4 months after transplantation. Although pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (group 1, p = 0.021; group 2, p = 0.0002), mean pulmonary artery pressure (group 1, p = 0.051; group 2, p = 0.004), and pulmonary vascular resistance (group 1, p = 0.0026; group 2, p = 0.056) were reduced by 1 hour after the onset of treatment and maintained unchanged until transplantation, the changes in mean pulmonary artery pressure in group 1 and pulmonary vascular resistance in group 2 were statistically insignificant except in the posttransplantation period. Long-term therapy with milrinone in combination with inotropic agents is safe and effective when only milrinone infusion is inadequate for pharmacologic support in status 1 candidates.
