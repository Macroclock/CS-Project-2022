[External ventricular support in primary cardiogenic shock]. Primary cardiogenic shock is a common condition with a high mortality rate. In this indication, mechanical assist plays an important part and has improved a lot over the last decade. The authors report their experience with the same assist device in patients with primary cardiogenic shock. Nineteen patients (9 dilated cardiomyopathies, 7 myocardial infarctions, 2 myocardities, 1 undetermined) were treated with an external mechanical ventricular assist device (Thoratec, Berkeley, U.S.). Fourteen patients received a biventricular assist and 5 had a uni-left ventricular assist device. Four of the 19 patients were completely weaned off their ventricular assist after 13, 27, 36 and 94 days, respectively. Ten patients underwent transplantation after an average of 43 days (range 8-95 days). Of the 19 patients, 7 had a portable console allowing autonomous ambulation. Five patients died under mechanical assistance (26.9%) and 3 patients died after transplantation. Three patients required temporary haemodialysis; 4 suffered embolic complications; 4 had mediastinal haemorrhages; 4 had bleeding from other sites, and 6 suffered from late tamponnade. Fourteen patients had at least one infectious episode. The authors conclude that, in patients referred for severe primary cardiogenic shock, the implantation of an external biventricular assist is a reliable option, allowing sequential weaning or being a bridge to transplantation in non-dependent patients, providing they are severely selected.
