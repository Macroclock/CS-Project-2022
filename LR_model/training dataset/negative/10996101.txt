A novel technique for intraaortic balloon pump placement via the left axillary artery in patients awaiting cardiac transplantation. In order to circumvent the problems associated with long-term femoral intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) placement we have developed and used a new technique of IABP placement. Over the past three years 13 patients awaiting cardiac transplantation have had placement of IABP via a vein cuff sewn to the left axillary artery. Thirteen patients have undergone IABP placement using this technique. The average duration of IABP support was 37 days (range 10-86 days). Ten patients were successfully transplanted. All patients were allowed to sit, stand and ambulate with assistance. No neurologic complications occurred. There were no episodes of sepsis related to balloon or insertion site. No patient had limb ischemia during IABP counterpulsation. Left axillary artery IABP insertion via a vein cuff portal is a straightforward technique with minimal complications. This method serves as a bridge to cardiac transplantation in a gravely ill group of patients while preserving patient mobility during the waiting period for a donor heart.
