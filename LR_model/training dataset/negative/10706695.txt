Vigorous allograft rejection in the absence of danger. Tolerance to self is a necessary attribute of the immune system. It is thought that most autoreactive T cells are deleted in the thymus during the process of negative selection. However, peripheral tolerance mechanisms also exist to prevent development of autoimmune diseases against peripheral self-Ags. It has been proposed that T cells develop tolerance to peripheral self-Ags encountered in the absence of inflammation or "danger" signals. We have used immunodeficient Rag 1-/- mice to study the response of T cells to neo-self peripheral Ags in the form of well-healed skin and vascularized cardiac allografts. In this paper we report that skin and cardiac allografts without evidence of inflammation are vigorously rejected by transferred T cells or when recipients are reconstituted with T cells at a physiologic rate by nude bone graft transplantation. These results provide new insights into the role of inflammation or "danger" in the initiation of T cell-dependent immune responses. These findings also have profound implications in organ transplantation and suggest that in the absence of central deletional tolerance, peripheral tolerance mechanisms are not sufficient to inhibit alloimmune responses even in the absence of inflammation or danger.
