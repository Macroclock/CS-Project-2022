Acute diverticulitis in heart- and lung transplant patients. Significant gastrointestinal complications have been observed in patients following heart- and lung transplantation. These complications can occur in the immediate post-operative period or remote from the time of transplantation. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 268 consecutive patients who received either heart- or lung transplants at Henry Ford Hospital between 1985 and 1998. Two hundred and thirty-three patients received heart transplants and 35 underwent lung transplantation. Two patients developed acute diverticulitis post transplant, both requiring surgery. Management of acute diverticulitis in the heart- and lung transplant population requires a high index of suspicion. Early and aggressive diagnosis is mandatory. Surgical intervention must be prompt when indicated, with meticulous attention to surgical technique. With appropriate intervention, reasonable outcomes can be expected.
