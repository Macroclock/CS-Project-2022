Balloon-expandable stent placement for superior vena cava-right atrial stenosis after heart transplantation. Anastomotic Stenoses are well known as a complication of vascular and cardiovascular surgical procedures; such a lesion was encountered at the superior vena cava-right atrial anastomosis after cardiac transplantation. A balloon expandable stent was used to relieve this anastomotic constriction, employing a 16 mm diameter balloon to deliver a P304 stent. Stent placement resulted in complete relief of the patient's symptoms and facilitated the passage of bioptomes through the superior vena cava for subsequent biopsy procedures following cardiac transplantation.
