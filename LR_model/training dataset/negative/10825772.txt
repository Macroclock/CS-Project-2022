Studies of cardiac function and myocardial tissue characterization. The heart can be studied using ultrasound techniques. The shape of the heart, its chambers, wall thicknesses, wall tissue characteristics as well as motion of walls and valve leaflets are all diagnostic information. In addition, the blood velocity and its timing within the cardiac cycle is an important diagnostic tool. In the present paper focus will be limited to the analysis of the left ventricular function as observed with two-dimensional and three-dimensional echocardiography and the characteristics of backscattered ultrasound information from the left ventricular chamber wall. Function of the heart is often studied by observation of local wall motion or comparison of chamber volume in maximum and minimum shapes during the cardiac cycle (ejection fraction). Integrated backscatter from the wall is described in examples of cardiac transplantation and hypertrophy. Study of cyclic variation of frequency-dependent attenuation and integrated backscatter indicates that these are independent parameters.
