Histologic features of actinic keratoses in solid organ transplant recipients and healthy controls. Squamoproliferative lesions are common in patients who are immunosuppressed, particularly in recipients of solid organ transplants. Histologic features in such biopsy specimens may differ from those of otherwise healthy patients. Actinic keratoses (AKs) in transplant recipients may possess pathologic characteristics that suggest that they arose in an immunosuppressed host. We evaluated 30 randomly selected AKs from 25 recipients of solid organ transplants and compared their histologic features to those of 50 AKs from 45 patients who were not immunosuppressed. Tissue samples were categorized by sex, patient age, and site of biopsy. Sixteen separate histologic criteria were evaluated in a blinded fashion in each specimen. Statistical analysis was performed between the two groups with and without controlling for the age of the patient. The transplant group was significantly younger (54.8 years) than the nontransplant group (70.0) and contained more men (88%) than women (51%). AKs from transplant recipients were statistically more likely to demonstrate bacterial colonization, confluent parakeratosis, hyperkeratosis, increased mitotic activity, and verrucous changes. After controlling for age only, hyperkeratosis failed to be more prevalent in the transplant group. Certain histopathologic features are more common in AKs of immunosuppressed transplant recipients and may be used to distinguish between those removed from otherwise healthy persons.
