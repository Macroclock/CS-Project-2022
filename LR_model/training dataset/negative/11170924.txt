Immunogenicity of pneumococcal vaccine in heart transplant recipients. To assess the immunogenicity of pneumococcal vaccine in recipients of heart transplants, we immunized 35 long-term transplantation survivors with pneumococcal vaccine and measured the pre- and postvaccination IgG antibody titers to 5 representative vaccine capsular polysaccharides. Responses of heart transplant recipients to pneumococcal vaccine antigens were generally suppressed.
