Intravenous therapy for advanced heart failure. Because of the standard use of oral neurohumoral antagonists, the role of intravenous agents for advanced heart failure patients has changed profoundly. Their current use as medical therapy is restricted to two indications: first, as short-term infusion (hours to days) in advanced heart failure patients who decompensate into a symptomatic New York Heart Association class IV condition and who are admitted for rapid hemodynamic support with intravenous vasodilators or inotropes; in these patients after hemodynamic and clinical stabilization, optimization of conventional heart failure therapy has to be reconsidered; second, as long-term application in heart transplantation candidates who are in a similar desperate condition although already receiving maximal oral heart failure therapy.
