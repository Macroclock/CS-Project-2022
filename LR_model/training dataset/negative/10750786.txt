Prolonged extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. Cardiac transplantation provides the best option for neonates with congenital heart disease that is not amenable to surgical repair or palliation. The scarcity of suitable organs for this group has resulted in prolonged waiting times; many infants die awaiting transplantation. We present the case of a newborn with severe Ebstein's anomaly and low cardiac output who was supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 1,126 hours, until an appropriate organ became available.
