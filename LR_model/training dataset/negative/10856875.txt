Undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass using enoxaparin only during a cardiac transplantation procedure. The use of enoxaparin as a replacement drug to standard heparin, for anticoagulation during extracorporeal circulation, in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, is still very limited. Enoxaparin significantly reduces thrombin formation and activity during cardiopulmonary bypass. The prolonged circulating rate, slow elimination rate and non-total reversion of enoxaparin by protamine can induce important postoperative bleeding. We are describing the first case of cardiac transplantation where enoxaparin was used as a replacement drug to standard heparin.
