Anti-CD4 induced rat heart tolerance: no presence of primed T cells and regulatory mechanisms for cytotoxic T cells. Treatment with anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (OX38) induces heart, but not skin graft tolerance in WF (RT1u) to Lewis (RT1l) rat strain combinations. We examined differences in cellular responses between heart-bearing and skin-rejected hosts that were both treated with anti-CD4 mAb. In the tolerant LEW rats bearing WF heart transplants, the secondary WF heart but not skin grafts were accepted. On the other hand, in anti-CD4 treated WF skin-rejected hosts, both secondary WF heart and skin grafts were rapidly rejected. Spleen cells from anti-CD4 treated WF skin-rejected LEW rats but not from WF heart-bearing LEW rats received the same treatment generated CTL after in vitro stimulation with paraformaldehyde (PFA) treated donor WF stimulator spleen cells. Adoptive transfer of spleen cells from WF skin-rejected LEW rats with or without anti-CD4 therapy into the tolerant LEW rats at the secondary WF heart transplantation blocked the secondary heart graft acceptance. However, transfer of spleen cells from WF heart-rejected rats without immunosuppression failed to block acceptance of the secondary heart graft. Our results indicated the lack of primed T cells and presence of regulatory mechanisms for tissue specific T cells in anti-CD4 treated heart bearing hosts.
