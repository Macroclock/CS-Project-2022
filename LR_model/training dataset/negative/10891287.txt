Regulatory role of Th-2 cytokines, IL-10 and IL-4, in cardiac allograft rejection. The host response to alloantigen results in T- and B-cell activation, upregulation of Class II MHC antigens, and cytokine production by Th-1 cells, resulting in generation of IL-2 and IFN gamma. Th-2 cell responses produce IL-4 and IL-10 which may shift the immune response from the Th-1 pathway to Th-2 responses, favoring Ig production. This could imply that Th-2-related cytokines protect allografts. In the following studies, employing cardiac heterotopic allografts in rats (Brown Norway into Lewis), we investigated regulatory roles of Th-2-related cytokines IL-4 and IL-10. Two strategies were used in animals receiving allografts: antibody-induced blocking of endogenous IL-4 or IL-10 and exogenous administration of either interleukin. Antibody to IL-4 failed to alter the rejection time, whereas anti-IL-10 greatly accelerated the rejection process. Northern blot analysis of RNA from allografted hearts revealed mRNA for both IL-4 and IL-10, while immunostaining showed strong staining for IL-10 and very weak staining for IL-4. Exogenous administration of either IL-4 or 10 caused prolongation of allograft rejection times. These findings suggest that in rat cardiac allografts intrinsic IL-10 functions to attenuate the rejection process.
