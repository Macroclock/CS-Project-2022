Hepatitis C transmission and infection by orthotopic heart transplantation. The transmission and clinical consequences of hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection acquired by orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) from an HCV-infected donor to an HCV-naive recipient have not been well described. We report our experience in 5 HCV-naive patients who were transplanted with hearts from HCV-positive donors. All transplants occurred within a 1-year period. After cardiac transplantation we retrospectively examined the recipients' clinical course, liver-associated enzymes, HCV-antibody serology, quantitative HCV RNA level, and HCV genotype. Five subjects with rapidly deteriorating heart failure and negative serum antibodies to HCV received an emergent OHT from a donor known to be infected with HCV. Liver-associated enzymes peaked at 2 to 6 weeks post-transplant: mean peak alanine aminotransferase was 180 U/L (normal, 9 to 52) and aspartate aminotransferase was 111 U/L (normal, 14 to 36). Liver enzymes had returned to normal limits by 6 and 12 months post-OHT. At a mean 15 months after transplantation, only 1 of 5 patients has developed antibodies to HCV, but 4 of 5 have evidence of infection, as shown by serum HCV RNA. No patient has developed evidence of liver failure. (1) Transmission of HCV from an HCV-positive donor to an HCV-naive recipient at the time of OHT is likely. (2) Antibodies to HCV post-OHT may remain negative for more than 1 year in these patients. (3) Hepatitis C viral RNA using polymerase chain reaction should be the test of choice for diagnosis of HCV infection post-OHT. (4) Hepatitis C viral donor hearts should be limited to critically ill patients in extremis until the long-term consequences of acquisition of HCV by an OHT recipient are known.
