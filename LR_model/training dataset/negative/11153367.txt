[Therapy of lymphomatoid papulosis with balneo-PUVA-photochemotherapy]]. Lymphomatoid papulosis is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder of the skin. The standard therapeutic regimen is systemic (oral) photochemotherapy (PUVA). We examined the efficacy of PUVA-bath photochemotherapy in a patient requiring heart transplantation because of idiopathic dilatated cardiomyopathy and a relative contraindication against systemic 8-methoxypsoralen. The 42-years old male patient had suffered for 15 years with itching papules and plaques which clinically, immunohistochemically and molecular biologically were diagnosed as lymphomatoid papulosis. PUVA-bath photochemotherapy with 8-MOP was initiated. After 29 treatments the plaques disappeared completely. After 44 sessions (cumulative UV-A dose 206 J/cm2) the patient's skin almost was clear. PUVA-bath photochemotherapy proved to be a therapeutic alternative to systemic PUVA-treatment in this case of lymphomatoid papulosis.
