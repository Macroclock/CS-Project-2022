[Neurological complications after organ transplantation]. Following organ transplantation, 30-60% of patients develop neurologic complications which can be classified as pre-existing deficits due to the underlying disease, complications during surgery, metabolic encephalopathies, neurotoxicity of immunosuppressant agents, opportunistic CNS infections, and secondary malignomas as indirect side effects of immunosuppression. While encephalopathies, seizures, or CNS infection can occur in all types of transplantation, some specific neurological complications exist for different types of organ transplantation. In this review, the clinical symptoms and treatment of both the common neurological complications as well as the particular neurological syndromes after liver, heart, and bone marrow transplantation are discussed.
