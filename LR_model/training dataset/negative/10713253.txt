Fructose-1,6-diphosphate and a glucose-free solution enhances functional recovery in hypothermic heart preservation. Fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) has been shown to protect tissue during hypoxia under various ischemic conditions, including isolated heart perfusion. We tested the hypothesis that adding FDP to St. Thomas solution can extend hypothermic heart preservation time. Sixteen adult Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Under general anesthesia, the hearts were removed and preserved at 4 degrees C in St. Thomas solution (30 ml/kg) for 12 hours. FDP (5 mM) was added to the St. Thomas solution in the study group (n = 8), whereas no FDP was used in the control group (n = 10). The hearts were reperfused after 12 hours of preservation using a working heart model. In the study group, cardiac output ranged from 13.00 +/- 2.34 to 17.66 +/- 1.71 ml/min, maximum aortic flow was 3.40 +/- 1.99 to 9.26 +/- 1.72 ml/min, left ventricular stroke volume ranged from 0.074 +/- 0.014 to 0.092 +/- 0.009 ml, left ventricular stroke work ranged from 6.22 +/- 0.39 to 7.95 +/- 0.44 ml/mmHg, and maximum left ventricular generated power was 14.38 +/- 2.94 to 20.16 +/- 2.49 Joules/min. All of these parameters were higher than those in the control group (p < 0.001). Coronary vascular resistance and myocardial tissue wet/dry weight ratio were lower in the study group than in the control group (p < 0.05). Heart function was better preserved when FDP was added to St. Thomas solution during hypothermic rat heart preservation. The mechanism is not totally clear, but enhancement of high-energy phosphate production during ischemia is possible. Key words: heart, procurement, hypothermia, fructose-1,6-diphosphate.
