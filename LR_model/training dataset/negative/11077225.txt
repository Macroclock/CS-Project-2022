Fluorescence spectroscopy of endomyocardial tissue post-human heart transplantation: does it correlate with histopathology? A significant correlation between autofluorescence spectroscopy and heart allograft rejection has been described in the rat heterotropic allograft model. However, the use of this technique in human heart transplants has not been validate. We obtained fluorescence and reflectance spectra on 37 human endomyocardial biopsy specimens and correlated the spectra with International Society Heart and Lung Transplantation grade for histologic rejection. Using different excitation wavelengths (ultraviolet, lambda = 337 nm; blue, lambda = 440 nm, and green, lambda = 486 nm), we found no significant difference in the fluorescence spectra among the different grades of rejection. Fluorescence spectroscopy is not a sensitive method for detecting rejection in human heart transplant recipients.
