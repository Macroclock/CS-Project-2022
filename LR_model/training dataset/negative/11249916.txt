Effect of pravastatin on plasma markers of inflammation and peripheral endothelial function in male heart transplant recipients. Statins appear to have several biologic effects beyond those of lipid metabolism, and we hypothesized that immunomodulating effects of statins are important for the beneficial effects of these medications after heart transplantation. Our findings suggest that pravastatin treatment reduces plasma markers of inflammation and improves peripheral endothelial function in heart transplant recipients, possibly contributing to the observed clinical benefits of statin treatment in these patients.
