"A beacon of light". Spirituality in the heart transplant patient. For the cardiac transplant recipients in this study, spirituality was like a beacon of light, providing illumination and sustaining hope while enduring illness. Spirituality was nurtured by Developing Faith and by the Presence of significant others, health care providers, and the Divine to sustain hope. Spirituality throughout the transplantation process was described by concepts of faith, presence, enduring illness, and sustaining hope. The four dynamic phases of Enduring Illness can assist health care providers in understanding what spirituality means to transplant patients. This conceptual model of spirituality demonstrates the important role that spirituality plays in recovery. Clinical application of this model will allow health care providers involved in the care of cardiac transplant patients to integrate spirituality into their patients' plan of care. With future research, this model can be easily modified and built upon to meet the needs of cardiac transplant patients in all phases of transplantation.
