Gene transfer of immunomodulatory peptides correlates with heme oxygenase-1 induction and enhanced allograft survival. Decapeptides derived from human HLA class I sequences have been shown to prolong allograft survival. The mechanism of action of these peptides has been uncertain, because they act in an MHC unrestricted manner. Recently, it was found that these peptides bind heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). In the present study, we sought to determine whether local delivery of these peptides through gene transfer could extend allograft survival, and to explore the underlying mechanisms. C57BL/6 neonatal hearts were transplanted to CBA/J recipients and the peptide, or plasmid DNA encoding the peptide, was injected directly into the allograft at the time of the transplant. Direct injection of 1 microg of the B2702 peptide into the allograft did not prolong survival (13.3+/-0.8 vs. 13.4+/-0.8 days for untreated controls), but injection of 400 microg of peptide did extend survival (22.0+/-0.6). Injection of plasmid DNA encoding the B2702 peptide was superior to peptide delivery, extending graft survival to 30.8+/-1.5 days. Similar results were obtained using another plasmid encoding the rationally designed peptide BC1 (28.5+/-1.7), whereas no significant prolongation was observed using a plasmid encoding the control peptide B2705 (16.5+/-1.0). To explore the hypothesis that these peptides exert their immunosuppressive effect by altering HO-1 activity, animals were treated with iron protoporphyrin, an inducer of HO-1 activity, or tin protoporphyrin, an inhibitor of HO-1. Treatment with iron protoporphyrin alone extended graft survival (24.5+/-1.6) and did not alter the benefit in survival seen with BC1 gene transfer (28.0+/-0.8). In contrast, treatment with tin protoporphyrin abolished the benefit of BC1 gene transfer (17.0+/-0.6). These results demonstrate that plasmid mediated gene transfer is an effective means for delivering immunosuppressive peptides to extend allograft survival. The experiments suggest that these peptides may act by increasing HO-1 activity and support a role for HO-1 in immune regulation and allograft survival.
