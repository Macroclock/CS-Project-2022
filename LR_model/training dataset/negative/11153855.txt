Neuropsychological performance as a function of cardiac status among heart transplant candidates: a replication. This study examined the relationship between cardiac function and cognitive test performance among candidates for heart transplant. Participants were 26 individuals undergoing heart catheterization within one day of completing a battery of cognitive tests. Partial correlation analyses controlling for age and education were used to examine the relationship between cardiac function and cognitive performance. Results replicate previous findings in that increasing hemodynamic pressure variables, e.g., pulmonary artery systolic pressure, were associated with decreased cognitive performance on a measure of psychomotor speed and attention (Trail Making Test-Part A: r=.53). In contrast, cardiac output and cardiac index appeared to be not significantly related to cognitive performance. Taken together, poor performance on cognitive tests among heart transplant candidates appears to be attentionally mediated.
