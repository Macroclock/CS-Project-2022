Posttransplant diabetes mellitus in pediatric thoracic organ recipients receiving tacrolimus-based immunosuppression. Posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a well-known complication of tacrolimus-based immunosuppression in both adult and pediatric solid organ recipients. The "natural history" of diabetes in the pediatric thoracic transplant population has not yet been described. We identified all pediatric thoracic transplant patients receiving tacrolimus-based immunosuppression who developed PTDM. Medical records were reviewed, with a particular focus on the clinical course of PTDM and its relationship to drug weaning. Diabetes developed in 24 of 143 (17%) 30-day survivors of heart (12/96, 13%) and heart-lung/lung (12/ 47, 26%) transplantation. In 17 (71%) patients, the immunosuppressive regimen at the onset of PTDM also included maintenance corticosteroids. Seventeen patients demonstrated glucose intolerance before the onset of diabetes. Nine patients (38%) developed diabetes during pulsed corticosteroid therapy. Median time of onset after transplantation was 9.0 months. All patients required s.c. insulin for glucose control. The median follow-up from transplant was 49.9 months. There was a significant decrease in mean tacrolimus dosage (P<0.01), tacrolimus level (P<0.04), and steroid dosage (P<0.02) from onset of PTDM to most recent follow-up. Despite this significant reduction in immunosuppression, only 3/24 (13%) patients were successfully weaned off insulin. Diabetes mellitus is a common complication in pediatric thoracic transplant patients receiving tacrolimus-based immunosuppression. Insulin dependence in our population rarely resolved, even after lowering tacrolimus and steroid doses. Discontinuation of steroids did not guarantee resolution of diabetes.
