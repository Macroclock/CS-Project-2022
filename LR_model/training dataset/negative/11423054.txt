Elevated plasma tissue plasminogen activator and anti-THP-1 antibodies are independently associated with decreased graft survival in cardiac transplant recipients. Hemostatic and immunologic factors have been implicated in future cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease. The role of these factors and their interaction is less established in cardiac transplant recipients. We sought to characterize the role of these factors in these patients. Cardiac transplant patients who presented for surveillance coronary angiography and/or endomyocardial biopsy were eligible for enrollment. Ninety-nine consecutive patients were enrolled. Plasma levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, von Willebrand factor, fibrin D-dimer, and anti-t-PA antibody were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Anti-THP-1 cell antibodies directed against a monocytic leukemia cell line were detected by incubating patient plasma with THP-1 cells. Bound antibody was detected using goat peroxidase-labeled immunoglobulin G directed against human immunoglobulins. Lipids were measured by enzymatic methods. Multivariate analysis identified the presence of anti-THP-1 cell antibodies (risk ratio 4.41, p = 0.002), t-PA antigen (risk ratio 1.10, p = 0.033), donor age 20 to 26 years (risk ratio 8.83, p = 0.042), and donor age >36 years (risk ratio 15.53, p = 0.009) as predictors of allograft failure. Altered hemostatic function, as demonstrated by elevated plasma t-PA antigen levels, is predictive of subsequent allograft failure in cardiac transplant recipients. In addition, the presence of anti-THP-1 cell antibodies in these patients is predictive of allograft failure.
