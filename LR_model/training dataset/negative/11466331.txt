Rejection of mouse cardiac allografts by costimulation in trans. The activation of T cells by B7 costimulation in trans has been demonstrated in vitro, but the in vivo relevance is unknown. To study costimulation in trans of CD4(+) T cells in vivo, we performed cardiac transplants from B7-1/B7-2-deficient mice to recipients that do not express MHC class II molecules on peripheral APCs, but do have functional CD4(+) T cells (II(-)/4(+) mice). This model restricts the B7-dependent activation of CD4(+) T cells to costimulation in trans and excludes any contribution from indirect Ag presentation. We find that II(-)/4(+) recipients reject B7-deficient grafts as rapidly as wild-type grafts, suggesting that costimulation in trans can mediate rejection as potently as costimulation in cis. Treatment of II(-)/4(+) recipients of B7-deficient grafts with depleting Abs to CD4 or CD8 demonstrates that indirect Ag presentation to CD8(+) cells does not significantly contribute to rejection. This is the first demonstration that costimulation in trans can mediate an immune response in vivo and has important therapeutic implications.
