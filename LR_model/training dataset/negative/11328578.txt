Morphometric analysis of miniature swine hearts as potential human xenografts. Miniature swine are considered to be potential donors for clinical cardiac transplantation. However, it is unclear how an appropriately sized porcine donor will be selected for a particular human recipient. To address this issue, we performed a morphometric study of the swine heart using transthoracic echocardiography (n = 26) to determine the diameters of the aortic annulus and root, pulmonary artery annulus, and mitral valve annulus. We also obtained direct ex vivo measurements of swine heart weight and linear dimensions (n = 71). Relationships between a swine's height, weight, length, chest circumference and these internal and external cardiac dimensions are described. The strongest correlations were found between a pig's body length and its aortic annulus and root diameters (r-values = 0.97). These relationships are accurately described by univariate linear regression models. By cross-relating our morphometric measurements of aortic annulus diameter in the miniature swine with normative human data, we were able to develop a nomogram, relating swine length and human height, which predicts which miniature swine would donate the best size-matched heart for a particular human recipient.
