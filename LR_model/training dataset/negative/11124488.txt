Recipient origin of neointimal vascular smooth muscle cells in cardiac allografts with transplant arteriosclerosis. Coronary artery disease is today's most important post-heart transplantation problem after the first perioperative year. Histologically, coronary artery disease is characterized by transplant arteriosclerosis. The current view on this vasculopathy is that vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells from the media of affected arteries proliferate and migrate into the sub-endothelial space (intima) in response to signals from inflammatory cells and damaged graft endothelium. According to this model, the intimal VSM cells in transplant arteriosclerotic lesions should originate from donor tissue. Using recipient-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of microdissected, single, neointimal VSM nuclei, we recently showed that after allogeneic aorta transplantation the neointimal VSM cells are of recipient and not of donor origin. In this study, we analyzed whether VSM-cell replacement with recipient-derived cells also takes place after allogeneic heart transplantation. Cardiac allografts, when transplanted from female donors to male immune-modulated recipient rats, eventually developed transplant arteriosclerosis. We microdissected alpha-actin positive neointimal VSM cells from tissue sections and determined the origin (donor or recipient) using recipient-specific (male), single-cell, PCR analysis. In total, we analyzed 35 VSM-cell nuclei from 3 allografts, and PCR analysis revealed that 30/35 (86%) of the samples displayed the male-specific 128 base pair DNA fragment. These results indicate that after allogeneic cardiac transplantation, at least 86% of VSM cells in transplant arteriosclerotic lesions are of recipient origin. In contrast to current thought, the neointimal VSM cells in cardiac allografts that show transplant arteriosclerosis are of recipient and not of donor origin.
