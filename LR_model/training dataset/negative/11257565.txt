A retrospective assessment of safety, efficacy, and pharmacoeconomics of generic azathioprine in heart-transplant recipients. Although a generic formulation of azathioprine (AZA) has been available since 1996, safety, efficacy and pharmacoeconomic implications following conversion from Imuran (AZA) to generic AZA in heart-transplant patients remains to be determined. A retrospective, safety and efficacy assessment, in addition to a cost comparison, was performed in 30 heart-transplant patients who had been switched from Imuran to generic AZA. In heart-transplant patients converted from Imuran to generic AZA, no compromise in safety and efficacy, as measured by white blood cell (WBC) count, infections, rejections, malignancies, and hospitalizations was observed. Generic substitution of Imuran results in an annual cost savings of $318 per patient.
