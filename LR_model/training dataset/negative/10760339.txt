Improved survival in patients with nonischemic advanced heart failure and syncope treated with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. The purpose of this study was to assess whether in patients with syncope and heart failure due to nonischemic cardiomyopathy, treatment with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) compared with conventional medical therapy is associated with a reduction in sudden death and total mortality. Patients with advanced heart failure who have syncope have been shown to be at high risk for sudden death. Further risk stratification has been difficult in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy in whom inducibility on electrophysiologic study is not predictive of future risk. Of 639 consecutive patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy referred for heart transplantation, 147 patients with history of syncope and no prior history of sustained ventricular tachycardia or cardiac arrest were identified. Outcomes were compared for the 25 patients managed with an ICD and 122 patients managed with conventional medical therapy. There were no differences in the baseline variables in the 2 groups of patients, including age, ejection fraction, and medical treatments for heart failure, but patients receiving an ICD were more likely to have had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (56% vs. 15%, p = 0.001). During a mean follow-up of 22 months, there were 31 deaths, 18 sudden, in patients treated with conventional therapy, whereas there were 2 deaths, none sudden, in patients treated with an ICD. An appropriate shock occurred in 40% of the ICD patients. Actuarial survival at 2 years was 84.9% with ICD therapy and 66.9% with conventional therapy (p = 0.04). Thus, in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and syncope, therapy with an ICD is associated with a reduction in sudden death and an improvement in overall survival.
