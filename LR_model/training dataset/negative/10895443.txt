Hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome may be accurately diagnosed during fetal life. Prenatal diagnosis provides the opportunity for parents to make an informed choice about their options, including surgery, nonintervention postnatally or termination of pregnancy. Short to medium term survival continues to improve for a condition that was previously invariably lethal. There continues to be a significant mortality and morbidity associated with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and the long-term prognosis is unknown. Knowledge of the condition prior to birth means that babies who are to undergo surgery present in optimal condition for such interventions. Parents who have had an affected fetus or child should be offered detailed fetal echocardiography to exclude a recurrence in subsequent pregnancies.
