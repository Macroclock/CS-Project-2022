Fusarium infection after solid-organ transplantation. We describe a case of soft tissue infection caused by Fusarium species in a heart-liver transplant recipient, and review the cases of fusarial infection reported among solid-organ transplant (SOT) recipients. Unlike fusarial infection in patients with hematologic malignancies or bone marrow transplants, fusarial infection in SOT recipients tends to be localized, occurs later in the posttransplantation period, and has a better outcome. Surgical resection, when possible, and prolonged treatment with amphotericin provide the most effective form of therapy.
