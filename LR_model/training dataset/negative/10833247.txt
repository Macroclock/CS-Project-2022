Thoracic transplantation. Experimental orthotopic transplantation of the heart was accomplished in 1959. Long-term survival was achieved in 1965 with a chemical immunosuppression protocol substantially different from that used for renal and hepatic transplants. Performance characteristics of the transplanted denervated heart were found to differ only slightly from normal. It appeared by the time of the Clinical Congress of the American College of Surgeons in October 1967 that clinical heart transplantation might be justified if the concept of brain death could be legally recognized. The Stanford program in clinical heart transplantation was inaugurated on January 6, 1968 and has been in continuous operation. To date, more than 1000 patients have undergone transplantation of the heart with the 5-year survival at 75%. The first long-term success in lung transplantation occurred at Stanford in 1981, with transplantation of the heart and both lungs. In 1990 the concept of living pulmonary lobar donors was introduced and is slowly finding its clinical role. The steroid-sparing capability of cyclosporine made possible both successful lung and pediatric heart transplantation. Only the donor shortage remains as a substantial barrier to widespread thoracic transplantation. Xenotransplantation is under intense scrutiny, with some encouraging experimental results. Development of the artificial heart continues to offer some relief for patients with end-stage heart disease.
