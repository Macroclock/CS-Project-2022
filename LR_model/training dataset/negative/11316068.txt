The proliferative response of p53 knock-out mouse-derived vascular smooth muscle cell line, P53LMAC01, to PDGF, when compared with human aortic smooth muscle cells. To develop an in vitro experimental model of vascular smooth muscle cell hyperplasia, a major feature in chronic cardiac rejection, we studied a novel vascular smooth muscle cell line, P53LMAC01 (AC01), which was established from aortic smooth muscles of p53 knock-out mice, to determine its response to a platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and to Cyclosporin A (CsA). The responses were compared with those of human aortic smooth muscle cells (AOSMC). The AC01 exhibited a distinct proliferative response to PDGF similar to that of AOSMC under serum-free conditions. 10 ng/ml of PDGF-BB increased by a factor of 4.5 and PDGF-AB doubled the thymidine uptake, but PDGF-AA caused only a slight increase. The proliferation was markedly inhibited by 10(-6) M of CsA but less affected by 10(-7) M. These results indicate that the AC01 cell line could provide a convenient experimental system for investigating chronic rejection in vitro and that the system might work as a screening model of agents for treating transplant-related arteriosclerosis.
