Nocardia asteroides abscess after heart transplantation. We describe a patient who developed a primary, thigh adductor-muscle abscess caused by Nocardia asteroides 3 years after orthotopic cardiac transplantation. Nocardia was diagnosed by microbiologic culture and responded fully to a prolonged course of cotrimoxazole. The patient remains free of local or systemic disease at 2 years follow-up.
