Anesthesia for heart or single or double lung transplantation in the adult patient. Providing an anesthetic for patients undergoing heart or a single or double lung transplantation may represent a challenge even to the most experienced anesthesiologist. Patients with end-stage cardiac dysfunction have an impaired response to beta-agonist due to receptor downregulation. These patient will have isolated left ventricular dysfunction secondary to ischemic heart disease or present with biventricular failure with or without significant pulmonary hypertension. Increasingly, more patients have undergone prior major cardiac procedures and are at risk for significant perioperative bleeding. Patients undergoing single or double lung are particularly challenging because most of these procedures are performed without the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass. The anesthesiologist must be proficient at the management of one-lung ventilation techniques and have a rational physiologic approach to the management of intraoperative hypoxemia and auto-PEEP.
