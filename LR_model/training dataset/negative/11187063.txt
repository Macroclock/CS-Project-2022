[Graft dysfunction after heart transplantation]. Graft dysfunction/failure is an important cause of morbidity and mortality either in early or late postoperative period after heart transplantation (HTx). Early graft failure is briefly discussed. Main causes of late graft failure are acute rejection and graft vessel disease. Rejection episodes with hemodynamic compromising are rather low (5%). Graft vessel disease is the dominant cause of systolic graft dysfunction which can appears several years after HTx.
