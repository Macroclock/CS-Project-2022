Traumatic disruption of the ascending aorta in a child after heart transplant. We report a traumatic disruption of the ascending aorta in an 8-year-old boy who had undergone orthotopic cardiac transplant at 6.5 years of age for congenital heart block and dilated cardiomyopathy. At presentation his aortic injury was not immediately recognized, but persistence in identifying and confirming a suspicious aortic rupture was lifesaving.
