Tricuspid valve replacement after cardiac transplantation. Tricuspid regurgitation, a fairly common finding after cardiac transplantation, is generally mild or moderate, and is not clinically significant. The etiology of tricuspid regurgitation is not entirely understood, and experience with valve replacement after cardiac transplantation is limited. We describe a case of progressively severe tricuspid regurgitation ultimately requiring tricuspid valve replacement. At operation, the ruptured chordae of the posterior part of anterior and septal leaflet with resulting partially flail leaflets were found. Examination of the papillary muscle showed origins of several of the ruptured chordae. Damage to the tricuspid subvalvular apparatus at endomyocardial biopsy appeared to be a possible cause. A 31-mm Carpentier-Edwards porcine valve was implanted. This was because replacement with a mechanical prosthesis would prevent future right-side heart catheterization and endomyocardial biopsy and in valve repair, the patient remains exposed to the risk of the recurrence of chordal rupture. We discuss proposed causes and choices in surgical technique.
