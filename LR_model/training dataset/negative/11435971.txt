The long-term effect of simultaneous heart and kidney transplantation on native renal function. It is unclear whether patients with heart failure and renal insufficiency should receive a simultaneous heart and kidney transplant or whether a single heart transplantation is sufficient to restore native renal function. We analyzed the renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration of the native and transplant kidneys in eight patients long term after simultaneous heart and kidney transplantation using a dynamic MAG3 radioisotope scan and serum creatinine determinations. All subjects had been hemodialysis dependent before transplantation. Seven patients suffered from an intrinsic renal disease that were diabetic nephropathy in three cases, small fibrotic kidneys of undetermined origin in two cases, one lupus nephritis, and cyclosporine nephrotoxicity in one patient who had a previous heart transplant. In one patient renal insufficiency was considered to be solely due to renal hypoperfusion because no intrinsic renal disease could be detected. All patients were on cyclosporine-based triple immunosuppression, transplanted for 4 to 10 years, exhibited cardiac ejection fractions of more than 50% and had normal serum creatinine values. Radioisotopic scan showed no function of the native kidneys in all seven patients with intrinsic renal disease but exhibited normal function of the native kidneys as well as the renal transplant in the patient without intrinsic kidney disease before transplantation. These data suggest that a simultaneous heart and kidney transplantation is necessary in patients with cardiomyopathy and renal insufficiency due to primary kidney disease, but not in those with hemodynamically mediated renal failure, even if an immunosuppressive regimen with calcineurin inhibitors is used.
