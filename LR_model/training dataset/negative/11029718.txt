Evaluation of regional wall motion and quantitative measures of ventricular function during dobutamine stress echocardiography in pediatric cardiac transplantation patients. Graft coronary disease is a leading cause of death in patients who have undergone cardiac transplantation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate regional wall motion response and quantitative measures of ventricular function during dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) in pediatric transplantation patients. Eleven patients were evaluated the first year after transplantation (10/11 no rejection). Ten of the 11 were reevaluated 1.2 +/- 0.3 years later (9/10 no rejection). Dobutamine stress echocardiography revealed the following: (1) baseline regional wall motion abnormalities in 80% that resolved in all, (2) increased heart rate and blood pressure, (3) no change in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, (4) decreased end-systolic diameter, (5) decreased wall stress and increased velocity of circumferential fiber shortening, (6) increased VCFcZ score (representing systolic left ventricular function), and (7) a decreased mitral passive-to-active filling ratio. Patients with rejection had abnormal VCFcZ scores at rest. Pediatric transplantation patients without rejection have baseline regional wall motion abnormalities. With DSE, the following are present: (1) resolution of wall motion abnormalities, (2) increased contractility independent of load, and (3) changes in diastolic parameters that reflect increased heart rate. Patients with rejection may have abnormal contractility at rest.
