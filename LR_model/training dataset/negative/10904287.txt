Treatment of persistent rejection with methotrexate in stable patients submitted to heart transplantation. To evaluate the use of methotrexate for the treatment of recurrent rejection in heart transplant recipients. We studied 6 patients submitted to heart transplantation that showed rejection grade >/= 3A (ISHLT) in two consecutive endomyocardial biopsy specimens. The dose was 11.26+/-3.75 mg/week. The evaluated data were: ventricular function, endomyocardial biopsy, white cell count and number of rejection episodes before and after methotrexate administration. There was a reduction in the number of rejection episodes (5.17+/-1.47 before methotrexate; 2.33+/-1.75 after 6 months and 3.17+/-2.99 after 12 months of treatment, p=0. 0193). The ventricular function was normal with ejection fraction of 76.5+/-4.80 before and 75.6+/-4.59 after methotrexate (p=0.4859). One patient did not finish the treatment because he showed signs of rejection associated with severe pericardial effusion. Five patients had a reduction in the white cell count (8,108+/-23.72 before and 5650+/-1350 after methotrexate, p=0.0961). One pulmonary infection with complete resolution after antibiotic treatment was observed. Methotrexate in low doses is an effective adjunct therapy in the treatment of recurrent rejection after heart transplantation.
