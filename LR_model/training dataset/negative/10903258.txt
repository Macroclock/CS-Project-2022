Airway complications following pediatric lung and heart-lung transplantation. Obstruction at the airway anastomosis is a recognized complication of adult heart-lung transplantation (HLT) and lung transplantation (LT). Data for pediatric transplantation have been scarce. We reviewed our experience in pediatric HLT and LT to determine the frequency of airway complications and to document the therapeutic modalities used for their treatment. Fifty-three patients (median age: 13.8 yr; range: 1.3 to 28.2 yr) underwent HLT (n = 25), SLT (n = 3), DLT (n = 25), or repeat DLT (n = 3) and survived for more than 72 h. Major anastomotic airway complications requiring intervention affected one of the 25 HLT (4%) and seven of the 28 LT (SLT + DLT) patients (25%) (p = 0.05). Four patients with granulation tissue occluding the airway were treated with forceps resection, laser ablation, or balloon dilatation. Three patients with fibrotic strictures received silicone stents, laser ablation, or balloon dilatation. Two patients with bronchomalacia or diffuse stricture below the anastomosis underwent metal stent placement. Five of seven patients who were treated for anastomotic complications had satisfactory relief of airway obstruction. As compared with previously studied adults, pediatric heart-lung transplant recipients had the same or a lower frequency, and pediatric lung transplant recipients had a higher frequency of major anastomotic airway complications. A variety of treatment modalities were necessary to achieve adequate relief of airway obstruction.
