Differential susceptibility of heart, skin, and islet allografts to T cell-mediated rejection. Although it is widely accepted that there is a hierarchy in the susceptibility of different allografts to rejection, the mechanisms responsible are unknown. We show that the increased susceptibility of H-2K(b+) skin and islet allografts to rejection is not based on their ability to activate more H-2K(b)-specific T cells in vivo; heart allografts stimulate the activation and proliferation of many more H-2K(b)-specific T cells than either skin or islet allografts. Rejection of all three types of graft generate memory cells by 25 days posttransplant. These data provide evidence that neither tissue-specific Ags nor, surprisingly, the number of APCs carried in the graft dictate their susceptibility to T cell-mediated rejection and suggest that the graft microenvironment and size may play a more important role in determining the susceptibility of an allograft to rejection and resistance to tolerance induction.
