Surgical alternatives for heart failure. Heart failure is one of the leading causes of hospitalization in the United States. Congestive heart failure is a chronic, progressive disease and its central element is remodeling of the cardiac chamber associated with ventricular dilation. Secondary mitral regurgitation is a complication of end-stage cardiomyopathy and is associated with poor prognosis. Historically, these patients were not considered operative candidates because of their high morbidity and mortality. Heart transplantation is now considered standard treatment for select patients with end-stage heart disease; however, it is applicable only to a small number of patients. In an effort to address this problem, newer and alternative surgical approaches are evolving, including mitral valve annuloplasty, the Batista procedure, and other left ventricular shape changing technologies. Using these operative techniques to alter the shape of the left ventricle, in combination with optimal medical management for heart failure, improves survival, and patients may avoid or postpone transplantation.
