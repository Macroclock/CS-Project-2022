Implantable left ventricular assist systems (LVAS): recent results. A report from a series of meetings sponsored by the Study Group on Advanced Heart Failure of the Working Group on Heart Failure. Implantable left ventricular assist systems (LVAS) consist of implantable pumps with small control consoles and power sources that can be worn externally. These systems provide far greater patient mobility and independence than external pumps with bulky control consoles. Patients with implantable LVAS can be discharged from hospital and are able to return to work and resume active sports. Most patients have received these systems as a bridge to heart transplantation. Clinical status and quality of life improve dramatically after device implantation and survival on support (60-70% after approx. 100 days of support) is acceptable compared with transplant candidates on medical therapy. Patient selection and adverse events, primarily bleeding, thromboembolism and infection, are important issues with LVAS. In the future, long-term support and bridging to myocardial recovery may become important indications for LVAS.
