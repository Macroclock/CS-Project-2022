Screening for solid organ malignancies prior to heart transplantation. Prognosis of solid organ cancer in immunosuppressed hosts is generally dismal. Therefore, every effort to identify patients with asymptomatic carcinomas before transplantation should be encouraged. Sixty-seven patients referred for heart transplantation were examined adhering to the scheme proposed at the 24th Bethesda Conference. To increase the sensitivity of this work-up, the following items were added: tumor marker assays (prostate-specific antigen in males, carcino embryogenic antigen), abdominal ultrasound, CT scan of the abdomen and the thorax, mammography/echography of the breasts, PAP smear, colonoscopy if carcino embryogenic antigen abnormal or occult blood in stool, prostate echography if prostate-specific antigen abnormal or prostate hypertrophy. Carcinoma was detected in 10 of the 67 patients; for 8 patients of this cancer group, transplantation was denied. Importantly, 9 of the 10 malignancies were detected by means of the diagnostic items that were added to the standard screening protocol. There were no significant differences between the cancer and the non-cancer group regarding mean age, sex, etiology of heart failure, and smoking history. Stratifying patients in younger (i.e., < or =54 years) and older (i.e., > or =55 years) age groups showed a significantly greater proportion of older patients in the cancer group (8/10=80%) compared to the non-cancer group (25/57=44%), P=0.04. After a mean follow-up of 34 months, 5 of the 36 transplanted patients developed a malignancy (4 skin carcinomas, 1 non-Hodgkin lymphoma). There have been no malignancy-related deaths until now. The importance of a thorough screening program in the triage of candidates with preexisting malignancies, especially in an older patient population, is illustrated in this report.
