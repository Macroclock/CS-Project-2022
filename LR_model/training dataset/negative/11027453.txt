Enhanced immunological tolerance against allograft rejection by oral administration of allogeneic antigen linked to cholera toxin B subunit. A single oral intragastric administration of cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) conjugated to allogeneic thymocytes (ATC, 4 x 10(7) cells) under conditions allowing the CTB to bind the complex to GM1 ganglioside receptors was shown to be efficacious in inducing peripheral T cell tolerance associated with significant suppression of both primary and secondary accelerated rejection of heart allografts when tested in mice. Allogeneic in vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), in vitro cytotoxicity responses, and mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) by T cells from mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), popliteal lymph nodes (PLN), and spleen were significantly reduced in mice treated with the CTB-ATC conjugate, as were also the numbers of cells in these organs producing IL-2, IFN-gamma, or IL-4. In contrast, a marked increase in the production of IL-4 in Peyer's patches (PP) and of TGF-beta(1) in PLN was observed. The suppressive potential of T cells from PP and/or MLN after oral treatment with CTB-ATC was further evident by intraperitoneal transfer of such cells from CTB-ATC-treated animals to primed recipients, which led to marked suppression of both allogen-specific DTH and MLR responses. A critical role for PP in inducing peripheral tolerance after oral CTB-ATC treatment was indicated by the absence of tolerance induction in animals whose PP had been destroyed before treatment with CTB-ATC. The results indicate that the protection against allograft rejection by oral treatment with CTB-ATC is mediated by T cells and associated with a strong induction of IL-4 production at mucosal sites and TGF-beta(1) at the effector sites.
