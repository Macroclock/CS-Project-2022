Pediatric cardiac transplant: results using a steroid-free maintenance regimen. We report on survival, rejection, lymphoma and renal function following cardiac transplant using a steroid-free maintenance immunosuppressive regimen. We have performed 73 cardiac transplants in 71 children under 16 yr of age in the last 12 yr. There were eight perioperative and four late deaths giving actuarial survival of 88, 88, 85 and 70% at 1, 2, 5 and 10 yr, respectively. A total of 11 (15.3%) children had one episode of rejection (grade 3) in the first 6 months; one died and one was re-transplanted because of rejection. There was only one episode of late rejection (8 yr post-transplant) because of low drug levels in a patient with lymphoma and sepsis. This patient did not survive. Three other children (5.6%) also developed lymphoma and recovered but one died subsequently of graft failure. Four children have developed severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate GFR <30 mL/min/m2). Two have not survived and one is expected to commence dialysis soon. The remainder have mild to moderate renal impairment. We report excellent survival and low rejection rates without use of long-term steroids. However the doses of cyclosporin used have had a significant effect on renal function in many cases.
