Early postoperative left ventricular function by echocardiographic strain is a predictor of 1-year mortality in heart transplant recipients. Left ventricular (LV) function can be accurately assessed using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography. The association between reduced LV global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) magnitude and risk for mortality in heart transplant recipients is unclear. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that LVGLS could predict 1-year mortality in heart transplant recipients. A total of 176 consecutive adult primary single-organ orthotopic heart transplant recipients were retrospectively evaluated. Of these, 167 had acceptable echocardiographic image quality and were included in the study. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, creatinine, C-reactive protein, and invasive hemodynamic parameters were measured, and echocardiography was performed 1 to 3 weeks after heart transplantation. LVGLS was averaged from regional strain in 16 LV segments. During the first year, 15 patients (9%) died 86 Â± 72 days after heart transplantation. LVGLS and LV ejection fraction were decreased in magnitude in nonsurvivors (P < .05). They were older and had higher donor ages. Mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were similar in the two groups, while all other hemodynamic parameters were increased in nonsurvivors (P < .05). LVGLS was the only significant (P = .02) noninvasive independent predictor, with a hazard ratio of 1.42 (95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.88; P = .02) per 1% decrease in strain magnitude, while pulmonary vascular resistance was a significant (P < .001) invasive predictor, with a hazard ratio of 3.98 (95% confidence interval, 2.01-7.87) of 1-year mortality in multivariate Cox regression analysis. Reduced LV function and increased pulmonary vascular resistance are related to poor prognosis in heart transplant recipients. Early assessment of LVGLS might be a noninvasive predictor of 1-year mortality in these patients.
