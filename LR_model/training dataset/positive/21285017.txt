[Preoperative and intraoperative risk factors affecting mortality after heart transplantation: a single-center experience]. We retrospectively analyzed case records to identify risk factors for mortality in heart transplant recipients in our center. Data of 123 patients (mean age 40.6±14 years and 97 male) transplanted from February 1998 to April 2009 were studied and analyzed. Pre- and intra-operative variables of the 73 patients who survived (Group 1, mean age 39.1±14.6, 58 male) and 50 patients who died (Group 2, mean age 42.6±12.9, 39 male) were compared. For statistical analysis Student t, Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square tests were used. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine independent risk factors for mortality and survival analysis was accomplished using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Overall mortality in the entire population was 40.6% (50/123). Actuarial survival was 74%, 65%, 51% and 31% at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years respectively. Major causes of death after heart transplantation were infections (30%), right ventricular failure (18%), rejection (12%) and sudden cardiac death (12%). Total ischemic time was 176.7±63.3 minutes (range 90-410 minutes). The total cardiopulmonary by-pass (CPB) time (114.3±27.7 vs 126.9±42.1 min, p=0.05), pre-operative creatinine clearance (81.0±31.5 vs 67.2±33.0 ml/min, p=0.02), urea (45.2±18.6 vs 57.8±35.2 mg/dl, p=0.02), and creatinine (1.01±0.25 vs 1.17±0.36 mg/dl, p=0.05) were significantly different between survivors and non-survivors. Group 2 patients had higher transpulmonary gradient (TPG) (9.21±5.16 vs 12.50±8.26 mmHg, p=0.02) as compared with group 1 patients. Logistic regression analysis revealed that preoperative creatinine clearance (OR 0.989, 95% CI 0.973-1.005, p=0.044), creatinine level (OR 2.028, 95% CI 0.288-14.301, p=0.027), total CPB time (OR 1.013, 95% CI 1.000-1.027, p=0.036), and TPG (OR 1.113, 95% CI 0.992 1.249, p=0.045) were the independent predictors of mortality. Our data showed that TPG, total CPB time, pre-transplant renal dysfunction are pre-operative and intra-operative risk factors for mortality after heart transplantation.
