Efficacy and safety of pravastatin vs simvastatin after cardiac transplantation. Prior studies of cardiac transplant recipients have shown that pravastatin reduces 12-month rejection and mortality after cardiac transplantation and simvastatin reduces 4-year mortality, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, and intimal thickening. In a 12-month observational study, cardiac transplant recipients received open-label pravastatin 40 mg (n = 42) or simvastatin 20 mg daily (n = 45) on an alternating basis from the time of transplantation. Lipid levels, safety, and post-transplant outcomes were compared. We found no significant differences in total LDL or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, linearized infection or rejection rates, liver function tests, or immunosuppressant dosages between groups at 1, 3, 6, or 12 months. Rhabdomyolysis or myositis occurred only in patients on simvastatin (n = 6, 13.3%) with no episodes for patients on pravastatin (p = 0. 032). Survival at 12 months on an actual treatment basis was 97.6% for patients on pravastatin and 83.7% for those on simvastatin (p = 0.078). Immunosuppression-related deaths occurred in only 2.4% (1 patient) on pravastatin vs 15.6% (n = 7) on simvastatin (p = 0.06). Pravastatin and simvastatin resulted in comparable lipid profiles. Pravastatin use was however free from the high rates of rhabdomyolysis and myositis seen with simvastatin use. Pravastatin was additionally associated with a trend toward superior survival, attributable to fewer immunosuppression-related deaths. For safety and pharmacokinetic reasons, pravastatin should be considered the statin of choice after heart transplantation.
