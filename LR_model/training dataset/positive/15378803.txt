Heart transplantation. A Portuguese hospital center's experience. Cardiac transplantation is the gold standard therapy for patients below 60 years presenting with severe heart failure (HF) despite maximal medical therapy, who have no other surgical option and no contraindications to this procedure. We evaluated our experience with this important form of heart failure therapy. Between February 1987 and December 2002, 32 patients, aged 37 +/- 16 years, 19 males, with ejection fraction of 18 +/- 7%, underwent heart transplantation in our center. Seven (22%) patients were in NYHA class IV with hemodynamic support. Seventeen (53%) patients had idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), 7 (22%) had ischemic DCM, 3 (9%) had valvular DCM and the remainder had other causes of left ventricular dysfunction. Overall survival rate was 68% at first year post-transplantation, 59% at 5 years and 59% at 10 years. One year after cardiac transplantation, 95% of patients were in NYHA class I and the rest were in NYHA class II. Among the 13 patients who died, in five (18%) death occurred during the first month: the most frequent cause was hemodynamic failure. Causes of late death were: allograft vasculopathy (n = 3), allograft rejection (n = 1), infection (n = 1), sudden death (n = 1), hemodynamic failure (n = 1) and bradyarrhythmia (n = 1). Among the patients followed for more than one year, only three died. Early complications were: infection (8 episodes, 7 of respiratory location), right heart failure (3 patients), pericardial effusion (5 patients) and others (7 patients). Late complications were: a) allograft rejection: 17 (53%) patients, 72 episodes (10 ISHLT grade 3, 6 of whom were treated with intravenous corticotherapy, 8 grade 2 and 54 grade 1); b) infections: 19 (59%) patients; 35 episodes, 25 requiring hospitalization: 10 (28%) involving the respiratory tract, 6 (17%) the oropharynx, 5 (14%) the urinary tract, 4 (11%) the skin and 10 (28%) of undetermined location; c) chronic allograft rejection: 6 (19%) patients; d) arterial hypertension: 14 (45%) patients; d) renal failure: 5 (16%) patients; e) diabetes: 2 (6%) patients; f) cancer: 2 (6%) patients. Patients with severe heart failure and a very poor prognosis who underwent cardiac transplantation in our hospital showed marked improvement in functional capacity and quality of life and had an overall survival similar to the results of international heart transplantation registries. Complications during follow-up were similar to those usually described in the literature.
