Do donor characteristics really matter? Short- and long-term impact of donor characteristics on recipient survival, 1995-1999. We reviewed the impact of multiple donor characteristics on recipient mortality by univariate and multivariate analyses in a cohort of heart donors from 1995 to 1999. A sub-cohort of donors was also selected who met "marginal" criteria, and the early and late survival of these patients was then compared. Surrogates of donor size (donor weight, donor body mass index [BMI], BMI mismatch >20%), under-resuscitation (hematocrit, 24-hour fluid intake) and age >56 years were significantly associated with peri-operative mortality in the univariate analysis; in the multivariate analysis, only average donor heart rate at procurement (p =.001), donor hematocrit (p =.02) and donor weight (p =.05) were significantly associated. Few donor characteristics actually impact significantly on recipient outcome, and thus recipient characteristics may figure more prominently than those of the donor toward the risk of death after transplantation.
