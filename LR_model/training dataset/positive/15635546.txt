Current outcomes following heart transplantation. Survival after cardiac transplantation has improved progressively since its inception over 35 years ago, with current 1 year survival approaching 90% and 7 year survival approaching 75%. In view of continued severe donor shortages, allocation must balance the survival benefit margin for recipients with terminal heart failure (higher risk for death with multiple co-morbidities and refractory low output state) and the charge to maximize graft survival. Continued improvement in short and longer-term survival will depend on an understanding of the early and late risk factors after cardiac transplantation and the development of methods and treatments to neutralize them. Specific risk factors vary for the specific causes of mortality, which include primarily early graft failure, infection, and rejection during the first post transplant year; and allograft vasculopathy and malignancy in later years. Evolving trends in risk profiles and survival indicate that patients undergoing cardiac transplantation have experienced a gradual increase in risk profile over the past decade, and have improved survival. Patient-specific risk profiling will play an increasing role in the allocation of transplantation and other emerging therapies for patients with advanced heart failure.
