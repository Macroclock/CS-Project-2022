Survival beyond 10 years following heart transplantation: The Cleveland Clinic Foundation experience. Long-term survival after heart transplantation is a desirable although challenging goal. We analyzed clinical outcomes in the cohort of 170 patients who have undergone heart transplantation at The Cleveland Clinic Foundation and survived >10 years. We found 10-year and 15-year survival rates of 54% and 41%, respectively, in these patients, but there was also a high incidence of complications, such as hypertension, renal dysfunction, transplant vasculopathy, and malignancy. Long-term survival following cardiac transplantation is possible although complications are frequent. Beyond 10 years, malignancy is a major cause of death.
