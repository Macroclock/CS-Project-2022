Outcome following heart transplantation in Maori and Polynesian patients: a comparison with European New Zealanders. To compare demographic, clinical and outcome data of Maori and Polynesian with New Zealand European heart transplant patients. A retrospective analysis was made of data from the 104 patients who underwent heart transplantation at Green Lane Hospital over a period of twelve years, of whom 79 were European, 23 Maori/Polynesian, and two Asian. Clinical characteristics, blood group, HLA matching and outcomes of recipients were compared. There was no significant difference in age and gender between the two groups. Maori and Polynesian patients were heavier, had a greater body mass index and were more likely to have rheumatic heart disease than their European counterparts. Maori/Polynesian patients were predominantly blood group A, whilst European patients were mainly group O. The waiting time for a donor heart was similar in both groups. There was no significant difference in number of rejection episodes and survival. Green Lane Hospital has the largest international experience of heart transplantation in Maori and Polynesian patients. Although there are some differences in clinical profile, outcome in terms of rejection episodes and survival is similar in the two groups.
