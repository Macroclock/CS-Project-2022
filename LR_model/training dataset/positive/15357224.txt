Evidence for racial disparity in cardiac transplantation survival rates. Studies show that survival rates of cardiac transplantation are lower for African American transplant recipients than for Caucasians. Due to similarities in terms of etiology, treatment modalities and responses to these modalities, the authors examine some potential variables for survival of cardiac transplantation that have been well documented in both the renal transplantation literature and the medically managed congestive heart failure literature. The authors also discuss access to care, socioeconomic factors and immunological differences in attempting to identify relevant factors for survival of cardiac transplantation.
