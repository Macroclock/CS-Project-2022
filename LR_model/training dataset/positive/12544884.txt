Improved results after heart-lung transplantation: a 17-year experience. In selected patients with severe end-stage combined cardiopulmonary diseases, heart-lung transplantation (HLTx) remains the only therapeutical option for improving survival and quality of life. Since 1983, 51 HLTx were done at our institution. Mean patient age was 27+/-12 years with a mean donor age of 25+/-11 years. Indications for HLTx were primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) in 49% of patients, congenital heart disease in 39%, cystic fibrosis in 6%, and repeat-HLTx in 6%. Eleven patients were younger than 14 years. Among these pediatric patients, the indications were PPH in 55% of patients, pulmonary atresia with severe pulmonary artery hypoplasia in 27%, and cystic fibrosis and cardiomyopathy with fixed pulmonary hypertension in 9% of patients each. Two patients had additional liver transplantation because of chronic aggressive virus hepatitis. For organ preservation, Euro-Collins solution (lung perfusion) and cardioplegic solution according to Bretschneider (heart perfusion) were used until 1994. The University of Wisconsin solution replaced Bretschneider's solution in 1994. Since 1996, Perfadex, a low-potassium dextran-based preservation solution, replaced Euro-Collins. All transplantations were done through a median sternotomy until 1994. Thereafter, a transverse thoracotomy was used in patients with suspected adhesions. Until 1995, cyclosporine A, azathioprine, and prednisolone were used for immunosuppression. Since then, tacrolimus replaced cyclosporine A. From 1983 until 1993, perioperative mortality was 35% (6/19). From 1994 on perioperative mortality decreased to 12.5% (4/32). Early mortality was caused by graft failure (n=5), severe bleeding (n=2), multi-organ failure (n=2), and acute rejection (n=1). Cumulative survival rates were 81% after 30 days, 63% after 1 year, and 54% after 5 years, respectively. Since 1994, cumulative survival rates were markedly improved to 87% after 30 days, 81% after 6 months, and 78% after 1 year. There was no death during the first postoperative year among the 11 pediatric patients. Late death was mainly caused by obliterative bronchiolitis (OB; 76%); two patients died because of multi-organ failure or septic complications, respectively, and one patient died within the first postoperative year because of aspergillosis. Changes in organ preservation management, surgical techniques, and immunosuppressive therapy significantly improved the short- and mid-term results after HLTx. Long-term results can only be improved in cases of successful prevention and treatment of OB.
