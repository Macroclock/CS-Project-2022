Risk analysis in patients bridged to transplantation. Efforts to predict mortality in bridge to cardiac transplant patients have concentrated on preventricular assist device (VAD) status. To more fully identify factors influencing survival to transplant, we reviewed the preoperative and postoperative VAD courses of 105 bridge to transplant patients. Sixty-four parameters (34 pre-VAD, 30 post-VAD), including hemodynamics, complications, and evaluations of major organ function were examined and analyzed. Thirty-three patients (31%) died on VADs and 72 were transplanted. There were two posttransplant operative deaths (3%). By univariate analysis 23 of 64 factors were significant. These 23 factors were entered into a stepwise logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of survival to transplant. Four factors, including pre-VAD intubation (p < 0.005), cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time during VAD insertion (p < 0.0001), mean pulmonary artery pressure (first postoperative day after VAD) (p < 0.0002), and highest post-VAD creatinine (p < 0.01) were independent predictors of transplantation. Other than the need for intubation, pre-VAD variables were of little value in predicting survival to transplant. Problems during VAD insertion (long CPB time) and post-VAD renal insufficiency were independent predictors. Severe complications that developed during the interval of VAD support, including cerebrovascular accident, bleeding and infection, were surprisingly not predictors for transplantation.
