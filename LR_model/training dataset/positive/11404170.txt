Development of anti-major histocompatibility complex class I or II antibodies following left ventricular assist device implantation: effects on subsequent allograft rejection and survival. Previous reports have indicated that antibodies to HLA class I or II antigens develop in approximately 60% of patients following left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation, subsequent rates of allograft rejection are higher, and survival is adversely affected. We performed an analysis of the incidence of antibody development to HLA class I or II antigens by panel reactive antibody (PRA) screening following implantation of the HeartMate LVAD in 38 patients from October 1, 1996 to March 1, 2000 (6 LVAD deaths excluded from study). The occurrence of vascular or cellular rejection of International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation grade > or = 3A, as determined by endomyocardial biopsy following heart transplantation (HTX), were compared for patients with (n = 32, LVAD group) or without (n = 68, control group) preoperative LVAD support. After LVAD implantation, 9 patients (28%) in the LVAD group developed IgG antibodies to class I (n = 3), class II (n = 5), or both antigens (n = 1) with PRA > 10%. The remaining 23 patients (72%) had either no detectable IgG antibody development or IgG antibody development with PRA < 10%. At the time of HTX, only 4 patients in the LVAD group had persistent PRA > 10%. Only 3 patients (4%) in the control group had PRA > 10% at the time of HTX. The incidence of patients free from rejection at 6 and 12 months was 62% and 44% for the control group, and 49%, and 40% for the LVAD group, respectively (p not significant). The mean linearized rate plus or minus standard deviation of allograft rejection from 0 to 6 months and 7 to 12 months was 0.13 +/- 0.21 and 0.09 +/- 0.14 episodes a month, respectively, for patients with no LVAD support, and 0.17 +/-.25 and 0.06 +/- 0.1 episodes a month, respectively, for those with LVAD support (p = not significant). Post-transplantation survival at 1 and 2 years was 90% and 90%, respectively, for the control group, and 97% and 92%, respectively, for the LVAD group (p not significant). Patients with LVAD support before HTX do not appear to be at increased risk for significant allograft rejection in the first year or for death within the first 2 years after transplantation.
