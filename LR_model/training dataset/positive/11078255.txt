Outcome of infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome who undergo atrial septostomy before heart transplantation. This study evaluated the procedural and long-term outcome of infants who underwent atrial septostomy while awaiting transplant. The results suggest that septostomy improved outcome in these patients although infants needing a transseptal perforation were at higher risk.
