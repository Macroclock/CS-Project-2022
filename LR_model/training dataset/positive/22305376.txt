The Fourth INTERMACS Annual Report: 4,000 implants and counting. The Fourth Annual Report of the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) summarizes and analyzes the first 5 years of patient and data collection. With more than 4,000 patients entered into the database, the evolution of pump technology, strategy at implant, and pre-implant patient profiles are chronicled. A risk factor analysis of the entire adult primary implant population is provided, and the recent composition of patient profiles is examined. Current actuarial survival with continuous-flow pumps exceeds 80% at 1 year and 70% at 2 years.
