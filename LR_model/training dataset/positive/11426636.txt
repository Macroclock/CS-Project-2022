Simplified method of heterotopic rat heart transplantation using the cuff technique: application to sublethal dose protocol of methotrexate on allograft survival. Rodent heterotopic heart transplantation (HHT) models have been developed for the study of transplantation immunology. Most of these transplantations are performed by hand-suture techniques, requiring several months of training. We describe a modified technique of rat HHT in the neck, using a cuff method that can be mastered by beginners within a few weeks. Our main modification of the rat HHT in the neck is that the right superior vena cava of the graft is chosen as an outflow duct, while the pulmonary artery has been taken as an effluent drainage in the ordinary HHT models. The aorta of the donor is anastomosed with the carotid artery of the recipient. Donation can be completed within 5 min and vascular connections in the recipient done within 3 min, resulting in a minimum of ischemia time. Using this minimum surgical intervention model, we tested the immunosuppressive effect of a sublethal dose of methotrexate (MTX), which has been widely used in cancer therapy. Our results showed that high doses of MTX severely suppressed the recipient bone marrow, but prolonged heart allografts for more than 365 days after HHT. In conclusion, the new model simplified the rat HHT procedure and made it possible for the beginner of rodent transplantation to master this skill within a few weeks. Using this minimized intervention technique, we found that the high doses of MTX can significantly prolong the survival of fully mismatched DA heart graft in PVG/c recipient.
