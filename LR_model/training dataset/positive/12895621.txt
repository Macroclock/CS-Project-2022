Long-term survival (>10 years) of patients >60 years with induction therapy after cardiac transplantation. Cardiac transplantation has become an established method for end-stage heart disease. Short- and mid-term outcome has been known to be similar between younger and older (>60 years) recipients. So far, nothing is known about long-term outcome of old patients and the potential long-term effects of antibody induction therapy in these patients. The purpose of this study was to analyse long-term outcome of old cardiac transplant recipients who underwent antibody induction therapy. Since 1989, 203 patients (total n = 882) above 60 years have been transplanted at our center. On these patients n = 66 were above 65 years. Survival, incidences of rejection, infection, cancer, graft arteriosclerosis and the amount of renal insufficiency were compared with patients <60 years (n = 679), transplanted during the same period of time. Freedom from specific event was computed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared by log-rank test. Ten year survival was similar in all groups (<60 years: 53.7%; 60-64 years: 53.1% and >65 years: 60.2%; P = NS). Causes of death were similar in all patient groups. There were significant fewer rejection episodes in the older patient group (freedom from rejection: 74.9 vs. 83.5 vs. 90.6; P = 0.03). Yet significantly more number of patients >65 years were without steroid maintenance therapy (43.1%) compared to other patient groups (8.2 vs. 9.3%; P < 0.05). There was no difference in overall freedom from severe infection (74.1 vs. 67.7 vs. 85.3%; P = NS), whereas there was a trend towards more CMV disease in the oldest patient group (82.7 vs. 88.6 vs. 70.8%; P=0.06). The incidence of cancer was similar in all groups (freedom from cancer: 82.2 vs. 84.7 vs. 79.1%; P = NS), as well as there was no difference in severe graftsclerosis between all patients (79.2 vs. 93.7 vs. 93.3%; P = NS). There was no difference in development of chronic renal dysfunction (creatinine > 2.0 mg/dl) between the three groups (10 vs. 14 vs. 16%; P = NS). Old recipients of cardiac transplants have a similar long-term outcome than younger recipients. They were less prone to rejections, had a similar incidence of severe infections and showed a trend towards more CMV disease. All patients had a very low rate of graft arteriosclerosis that was similar amongst the groups. Age-related decline of the immune system further enhanced by immunomodulation of antibody induction therapy might be accounted for the results as well as steroid-free immunosuppression.
