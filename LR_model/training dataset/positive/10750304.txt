Long-term survivors of heart transplantation: the Hartford Hospital experience. Heart transplantation has been a clinical program at Hartford Hospital for the past 15 years, resulting in 206 transplants. The five-year survival rate is 69% and is 43% at 10 years. The first recipient is surviving and has had full rehabilitation. Thirteen patients have survived 10 years or more. Advances in immunosuppression are ongoing and will result in further long-term survivors. Graft vasculopathy and lack of organ donation are current problems.
