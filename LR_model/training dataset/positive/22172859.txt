Heart transplantation in patients aged 70 years and older: a two-decade experience. Advanced age has been viewed as a contraindication to orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). We analyzed the outcome of OHT in patients who were aged 70 years or older and compared the results with those in younger patients during a two-decade period. A total of 519 patients underwent first-time single-organ OHT at our institution from 1988 to 2009. Patients were divided into three groups by age: ≥70-years old (group 1, n=37), 60 to 69-years old (group 2, n=206), and ≤60-years old (group 3, n=276). Primary endpoints were 30-days, and 1-, 5-, and 10-years survival. Secondary outcomes included re-operation for bleeding, postoperative need for dialysis, and length of postoperative intubation. There was no significant difference in survival between the greater than or equal to 70-year-old group and the two younger age groups for the first 10 years after OHT. Survival rates at 30 days, and 1-, 5-, and 10-years, and median survival in group 1 recipients were 100%, 94.6%, 83.2%, 51.7%, and 10.9 years (CI 7.1-11.0), respectively; in group 2 those numbers were 97.6%, 92.7%, 73.8%, 47.7%, and 9.1 years (CI 6.7-10.9), respectively; and in group 3 those numbers were 96.4%, 92.0%, 74.7%, 57.1%, and 12.2 years (CI 10.7-15.4; P=NS), respectively. There was no significant difference in secondary outcomes of re-operation for bleeding, postoperative need for dialysis, and prolonged intubation among the three age groups. Patients who are aged 70 years and older can undergo heart transplantation with similar morbidity and mortality when compared with younger recipients. Advanced heart failure patients who are aged 70 years and older should not be excluded from transplant consideration based solely on an age criterion. Stringent patient selection, however, is necessary.
