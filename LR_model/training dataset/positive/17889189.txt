Mortality after heart-lung transplantation experience in a reference center. The 2006 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation registry reported that there were differences in mortality after heart-lung transplantation (HLT) depending on the etiology for transplantation. Our objective was to conduct an analysis on mortality after HLT at our center. From January 1991 to December 2006, 25 HLT were performed on patients with the following characteristics: mean age of 38 +/- 11 years with 62% males and 4% with previous surgery. The cohort included 17% urgent transplants. The mean ischemia time was 198 +/- 60 minutes. We divided patients into four etiologic groups: congenital heart disease of the Eisenmenger type; primary pulmonary hypertension; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/emphysema/fibrosis with right ventricular impact; or pulmonary dysfunction with concomitant left ventricular depression. Three patients were excluded from the analysis because they did not fit in any of the groups. The mean follow-up of the sample was 862 +/- 1290 days. The overall hospital survival as well as that at 1 and 5 years was 59%, 50%, and 37%, respectively. In the Eisemmenger's syndrome cohort no death occurred during hospitalization and survival at 5 years was 50%. HLT was a therapeutic option with high mortality. Hospital mortality was high in absolute terms. Congenital heart disease of the Eisenmenger type may be a lower risk group.
