Pre- and early postoperative risk factors for death after cardiac transplantation: a single center analysis. Due to the limited number of donor organs, death on the waiting list and waiting time for cardiac transplantation have markedly increased. A pressing need of appropriate selection criteria for patients who would benefit most from transplantation is apparent. The purpose of this study is to identify pre- and early postoperative risk factors that influence long term survival after cardiac transplantation. 702 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac transplantation between 3/1984 and 12/1997 were analyzed retrospectively for the influence of different pre- and early postoperative risk factors on early (30 days) and late death (5 years). Univariate and multivariate regression analysis revealed risk factors for early as well as late death. Predictors of early death were higher preoperative PVR, retransplantation, longer ischemic time, postoperative acute kidney failure and longer intubation time. Risk factors for late death were early transplant era, previous cardiac surgery, patients awaiting transplantation in a hospital, prolonged stay in an intensive care unit, and any rejection during the first month after transplantation. These results demonstrate that pre- and early postoperative risk factors have significant influence on early and long term survival.
