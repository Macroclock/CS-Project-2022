Usefulness of N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels in predicting survival in heart transplant recipients. We evaluated the prognostic value of plasma N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) in 71 transplanted heart recipients during a 38 +/- 2 month follow-up. The negative predictive value of NT-pro-BNP levels </=800 pg/ml to predict death was 97% (95% confidence interval 92 to 100). Thus, NT-pro-BNP levels </=800 pg/ml predict a middle-term good survival in transplanted heart recipients.
