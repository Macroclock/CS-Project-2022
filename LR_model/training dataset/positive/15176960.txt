Perioperative management in pediatric heart transplantation from 1988 to 2001: anesthetic experience in a single center. Pediatric cardiac transplantation is currently an accepted option for end-stage heart disease and congenital cardiac malformations. This report focuses on the anesthetic perioperative management in 12 yr. From 1988 to 2001 we performed 90 heart transplantations in 88 children, infants and neonates. The pediatric heart transplant program of the children's heart center at our university hospital started in June 1988 with the transplantation of a 2-yr-old boy who was suffering from congenital heart disease. Since then, 88 transplants have been performed. We divided our patients into two groups. Group 1 ranged from 1988 to 1996 and Group 2 from 1997 to 2001. The patient characteristics have not significantly changed over the years in our institution. At the time of transplantation, mean age of the patients was 2.6 +/- 4.3 yr from the period of 1988-1996 and 2.5 +/- 4.1 yr from 1997 to 2001. Since 1988, 90 transplants (Tx) in 88 patients have been performed. Two patients needed re-Tx within 2 days after the initial operation because of primary graft failure. Indications for Tx were congenital heart disease (n = 67) and cardiomyopathy (n = 21). In the subgroup of the patients suffering from congenital heart disease there were 46 with the diagnosis of HLHS, followed by endocardial fibroelastosis (n = 7); the remaining 14 patients had other complex cardiac malformations and some underwent corrective palliative cardiac surgery before Tx. Sixty-three patients were younger than 1 yr of age and only five children were older than 10 yr. Twenty-three percent of the patients on the waiting list died before Tx was possible. The overall survival rate was 79% at 1 yr and 73% at 5 and 10 yr. Infants with HLHS had a lower probability of survival after 5 yr compared with other diagnosis (69% vs. 84%). Until now 21 patients have died after Tx. The duration of anesthesia, time of CPB and the age at the time of surgery decreased over the years. It is always a challenge for the anesthesiologist to treat these patients with pulmonary hypertension as one of the most critical risks in this group of patients. The preventive therapy with vasodilators as well as the availability of mechanical assist devices before and after heart transplantation reduces the effects of transitional pulmonary hypertension and prevents the development of post-operative right heart failure.
