Pre-transplant obesity in heart transplantation: are there predictors of worse outcomes? Morbid obesity is increasingly observed in patients being evaluated for heart transplantation and represents a relative contraindication. We sought to evaluate the influence of pre-transplant obesity on morbidity and mortality after heart transplantation. We retrospectively reviewed 90 consecutive patients with preoperative obesity (BMI > or = 30) and 90 age matched patients with normal weight (BMI 19 - 26) who underwent heart transplantation at our institution between January 1997 and December 2005. Morbidly obese patients experienced higher rates of pre-transplant diabetes (29% vs 15%, p < 0.05) and prolonged waiting time before transplantation (191.4+/-136.1 vs 117.4+/-143.2 days, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in post-operative complications including rejection and major and minor infections. There was no difference in actuarial survival between the obese and control groups after a mean follow-up of 4.26+/-2.95 years (p = 0.513, log-rank statistic 0.452). Causes of death did not differ. Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed increased association of peripheral vascular disease (HR 31.718, p = 0.001), and pre operative inotropic support (HR 33.725, p = 0.013) with increased mortality in the obese group. This study suggests morbid obesity does not affect survival or rates of infection and rejection after heart transplantation.
