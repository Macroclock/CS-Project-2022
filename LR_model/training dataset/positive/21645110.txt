First two decades of paediatric heart transplantation in Sweden - outcome of listing and post-transplant results. To evaluate outcome in the first generation of children with end-stage heart disease to whom heart transplantation was available. Retrospective review of all 135 Swedish children <18 years old listed for heart transplantation 1989-2009, followed to December 31, 2009, including 74 (55%) with cardiomyopathy and 61 (45%) with congenital heart disease; 34 (25%) were infants (<1 year). Cumulative risk of requiring heart transplantation was 1:17,300 (11 patients who improved were omitted from outcome analysis). Waiting-list mortality was 31% (44% in infants). Median waiting time in 82 transplanted patients was 57 days (0-585 days). Post-transplant follow-up time was median 5.9 years (0.03-20.1 years), and actuarial survival was 92% at 1 year, 82% at 5 years, 76% at 10 years and 58% at 15 years. Survival after listing was 64% at 1 year, 58% at 5 years, 52% at 10 years and 40% at 15 years. Post-transplant complications included rejections (34%), malignancies (12%), renal failure (8%), coronary artery vasculopathy (6%) and re-transplantation (5%). Among 64 survivors, 84% were free of complications affecting prognosis. High waiting-list mortality and post-transplant attrition precluded 60% of this pioneer population from reaching adulthood. Functional status in survivors is generally good.
