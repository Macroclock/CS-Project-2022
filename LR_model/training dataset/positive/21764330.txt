Decreased post-transplant survival among heart transplant recipients with pre-transplant hepatitis C virus positivity. Transplant centers are reluctant to perform heart transplantation in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection because augmented immunosuppression could potentially increase mortality. However, there have been few studies examining whether HCV infection reduces survival after heart transplantation. We used data from the the U.S. Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients to perform a multicenter cohort study evaluating the association between recipient pre-transplant HCV status and survival after heart transplantation. Adults undergoing heart transplantation between January 1, 1993 and December 31, 2007 were eligible to participate. Among 20,687 heart transplant recipients (443 HCV-positive and 20,244 HCV-negative) at 103 institutions followed for a mean of 5.6 years, mortality was higher among HCV-positive than HCV-negative recipients (177 [40%] vs 6,367 [31.5%]; p = 0.0001). After matching on propensity score, hospital and gender, the hazard ratio (HR) of death for HCV-positive heart transplant recipients was 1.32 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08 to 1.61). Mortality rates were higher among HCV-positive heart transplant recipients at 1 year (9.4% vs 8.2%), 5 years (26.3% vs 22.9%), 10 years (53.1% vs 43.4%) and 15 years (74.8% vs 62.3%) post-transplantation. HRs did not vary by gender or overall number of heart transplantations performed at the center. Pre-transplant HCV positivity is associated with decreased survival after heart transplantation.
