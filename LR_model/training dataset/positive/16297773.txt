Ten-year follow-up of a randomized trial of pravastatin in heart transplant patients. Outcomes from this trial's first year data demonstrated significant benefit in heart transplant patients treated with pravastatin in cholesterol levels, survival, rejection with hemodynamic compromise, the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and decreased natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Other heart transplant studies have shown similar benefit. We now report the 10-year follow-up of this study. Ninety-seven heart transplant recipients were randomized to pravastatin (n = 47) or no pravastatin (n = 50) within 2 weeks after surgery both in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Ten-year outcomes include survival, cholesterol levels, and development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy documented by coronary angiography. Forty-two percent of the control patients crossed over to pravastatin treatment during the second year of the study, and 81% of the control patients were eventually placed on statin therapy by the 10-year follow-up. The control group had subsequent low and comparable cholesterol levels in Years 2 to 10 of the study compared with the patients originally randomized to pravastatin. Intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated that the pravastatin group compared with control had increased 10-year survival (68% vs 48%, p = 0.026). The 10-year freedom from angiographic cardiac allograft vasculopathy and/or death in the pravastatin group was significantly greater compared with the control group (43% vs 20%, p = 0.009). The 10-year follow-up of this study suggests that the use of pravastatin in heart transplant patients maintains survival benefit and appears to reduce the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy.
