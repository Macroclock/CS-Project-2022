Decline in heart transplant wait list mortality in the United States following broader regional sharing of donor hearts. A change in allocation algorithm in July 2006 allowed broader regional sharing of donor hearts in the United States (US). We assessed if the allocation change has been associated with a decline in wait list mortality in the US. We compared baseline characteristics and outcomes in patients â‰¥18 years old listed for a primary heart transplant in the US before (July 1, 2004-July 11, 2006, Era1) and after (July 12, 2006-June 30, 2009, Era 2) the change in allocation algorithm. Of 11 864 patients in the study, 4503 were listed during Era 1 and 7361 during Era 2. Patients listed during Era 2 were more likely to be listed status 1A, have an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and supported on a continuous flow assist device (P<0.001 for distribution. Patients listed in Era 2 were at a 17% lower risk of dying on the wait list or becoming too sick to transplant (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.83, 95% CI 0.75, 0.93). Transplant recipients in Era 2 were more likely to be transplanted as status 1A (37% versus 48%, respectively, P<0.001). Post-transplant in-hospital mortality (6.3% versus 5.4%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.86 for Era 2, 95% CI 0.79, 1.06) and 1-year survival were similar. The risk of death on the wait list or becoming too sick to transplant has decreased by 17% in the US since the allocation algorithm allowing broader regional sharing was implemented in 2006. The shift in hearts to sicker candidates has not resulted in higher in-hospital or first year post-transplant mortality.
