Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in primary graft failure after heart transplantation. The aim of this review was to analyze our results with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support for primary graft failure (PGF) in heart transplant recipients. A retrospective review of 239 consecutive patients who underwent heart transplantation between January 2000 and August 2009 was performed. Orthotopic, heterotopic, and heart lung transplants were included in this analysis. Over that time period, 54 patients developed PGF, of whom 39 patients required ECMO support. These 39 patients form the basis of this review. Thirty-four patients (87%) were successfully weaned from ECMO and 29 (74.3%) survived to hospital discharge. There were no significant differences in wean rates or complications between central and peripheral ECMO. Comparison of survival in the 39 ECMO patients to the non-PGF patients (n = 185) showed a significantly worse survival in the ECMO group (p = 0.007). When those patients who died in the first 30 days were excluded, there was no difference in overall survival between groups (p = 0.73). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation provides excellent circulatory support for patients with PGF after heart transplantation with good wean and survival to discharge rates.
