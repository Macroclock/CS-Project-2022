Tumor necrosis factor gene polymorphism and cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) limits survival after cardiac transplantation. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) may be a key factor in the development of CAV. Two bi-allelic polymorphisms associated with high TNF-alpha production have been identified in the TNF gene locus, TNFA1/2, at position -308 and TNFB1/2 at +252. We hypothesized that recipient TNFA2 and TNFB2 homozygosity is associated with the development of CAV after heart transplantation. TNF gene polymorphisms were analyzed by multiplex fluorescent solid-phase mini-sequencing in 70 cardiac transplant recipients. Recipients homozygous for TNFA2 or TNFB2 (Group A, n = 29) were compared with recipients heterozygous or homozygous for TNFA1 and TNFB1 (Group B, n = 41). Coronary arteriography was performed annually or when indicated. Cumulative freedom from CAV and survival was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier test. Mean follow-up was 3.8 +/- 0.3 years. In Group A, 11 of 29 recipients (38%) developed CAV compared with 9 of 41 (22%) in Group B (p = 0.12). Cumulative freedom from CAV at 3 years was 42% in Group A and 80% in Group B (p = 0.043). In Group A, 11 of 29 recipients (38%) died during follow-up compared with 4 of 41 (10%) in Group B (p = 0.006). Cumulative survival at 3 years was 72% in Group A and 93% in Group B (p = 0.003). The results suggest that TNFA2 and TNFB2 allele homozygosity is associated with cardiac allograft vasculopathy and mortality in heart transplant recipients.
