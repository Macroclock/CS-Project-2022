Simvastatin initiated early after heart transplantation: 8-year prospective experience. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that the use of statins in heart transplant patients lowers cholesterol levels and significantly reduces mortality and the development of transplant vasculopathy. The aim of the present study was to test these effects and the safety of statin therapy over an 8-year period. In 1991, a prospective, randomized, unmasked study was initiated to compare the efficacy of simvastatin, started on the fourth postoperative day (n=35), with that of dietary therapy alone (n=37). Because of significantly improved survival and a lower incidence of transplant vasculopathy, most patients in both groups received statins as open-label prescriptions after 4 years. After 8 years, the Kaplan-Meier survival rate was 88.6% in the simvastatin group versus 59.5% in the control group (P<0.006 by log rank; hazard ratio, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.71). Deaths in the simvastatin and control groups were due to transplant vasculopathy (1 versus 4; P<0.2), severe transplant rejection (1 versus 5; P<0.1), malignancies (0 versus 3; P<0.1), and other causes (2 versus 3; P<0.7). The incidence of transplant vasculopathy confirmed by angiography was 24.4% in the simvastatin group versus 54.7% in the control group (P<0.02 by log rank). There was no difference in organ function between the 2 groups. No severe adverse effects of the therapy were observed up to the end of the 8-year observation period. Simvastatin therapy initiated early after heart transplantation leads to significantly better 8-year survival rates and a significantly lower incidence of transplant vasculopathy without impairment of organ function or severe adverse effects.
