Impact of donor spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage on outcome after heart transplantation. Donor cause of death has been suggested to have a significant impact on cardiac transplant morbidity and mortality. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of donor spontaneous intracranial bleeding on clinical outcome after heart transplantation. A group of 160 recipients underwent cardiac transplantation from donors with spontaneous intracranial bleeding (ICB group). These were compared with 197 recipients who were transplanted from trauma donors (Trauma group). A higher 4-year mortality rate was noted in the ICB group (24% vs. 14%, p=0.015). ICB as a cause of donor death was an independent predictor of recipient mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 2.02, 95% CI 1.27-3.40, p<0.0001). Compared with the Trauma group, the ICB group had an increased incidence of post-transplant graft dysfunction during the first week of transplant (10% vs. 3%, p=0.007), and higher incidence of interstitial myocardial fibrosis on their endomyocardial biopsies within 4 weeks of transplant (21% vs. 9%, p=0.0012). There was a trend towards an increased rate of allograft vasculopathy in the ICB group (competing risks adjusted hazard ratio 1.39, 95% CI 0.90-2.13, p = 0.14).
