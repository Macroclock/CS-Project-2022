Immunosuppressive therapies after heart transplantation: best, better, and beyond. Despite the significant advances in transplantation immunology and immunosuppressive therapies over the past 30 years, current immunosuppressive regimens are still inadequate in the majority of cardiac transplant recipients. Although short- and long-term survival rates have improved significantly, only 50% will survive 10 years and very few will survive 20 years. Complications of overimmunosuppression and underimmunosuppression account for the majority of these deaths. Only true "immunologic" tolerance can provide the outcome we pursue, namely, prolonged allograft function and otherwise normal immune function without chronic immunosuppressive therapy and its risks. Until a successful tolerance-inducing protocol is developed, we must use the current and upcoming immunosuppressive agents and techniques.
