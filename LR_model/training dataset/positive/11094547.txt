[Heart transplantation]. In carefully selected patients with end-stage heart failure heart transplantation has developed from an experimental procedure to standard therapy during the last 30 years. It is currently accepted as a procedure for prolonging life and also for improving quality of life. According to the Registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation the overall one-year actuarial survival is 79% and 10-year survival barely 50%. Nine years after the start of the Heart Transplant Program at Rigshospitalet the overall actuarial survival of 157 consecutive patients is 66%. Due to the limited donor access a decline of heart transplant recipients has been recorded during the late nineties. Mechanical replacement of the heart may develop from technological advances and possibly this therapy may gain a complementary status in heart failure, however the human biological replacement is currently the standard.
