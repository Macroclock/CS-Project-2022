Is there racial disparity in outcomes after solid organ transplantation? We sought to determine if disparities in survival and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) occurred after solid organ transplantation at our institution. Data were extracted from a database including information regarding transplants that took place from 1990 to 2002. The HRQOL was assessed in patients by using the Karnofsky functional performance (FP) index and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire. Data were collected on recipients of liver (n = 413), heart (n = 299), kidney (n = 892), and lung (n = 156). Blacks represented a minority of recipients: liver 7%, heart 8%, kidney 23%, and lung 6%. There were no statistically significant differences in patient survival between blacks and whites. Graft survival differed in kidney only with a 5-year survival: 72% for blacks versus 79% for whites (P <0.001). The FP and HRQOL improved (P <0.05) after transplantation in both groups. There were no differences on measures of the FP or HRQOL. Blacks had comparable survival and improvement in FP and HRQOL in comparison with whites.
