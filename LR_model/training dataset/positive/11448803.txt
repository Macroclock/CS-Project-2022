Intra-aortic balloon pumping in children with dilated cardiomyopathy as a bridge to transplantation. Children with dilated cardiomyopathy awaiting transplantation who fail maximal pharmacologic therapy may benefit from intra-aortic balloon pumping. Between July 1993 and August 1999, a total of 4 children with dilated cardiomyopathy underwent pre-transplant balloon pumping for 6.0 +/- 5.8 (1 to 12) days. One child (pumped for 12 days) died awaiting transplant, and the remaining 3 were successfully transplanted. Intra-aortic balloon pumping timed precisely with M-mode echocardiographic markers offers a relatively simple and safe intermediate level of mechanical support for children with dilated cardiomyopathy who fail pharmacologic support.
