Anti-human leukocyte antigen antibodies are associated with restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention for cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to palliate cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) has been associated with high restenosis rates, possibly related to increased inflammation associated with this disease. Whether markers of immunologic rejection are associated with restenosis in this population is unknown. The goal of the study was to determine the predictors of restenosis after PCI for CAV. Records were reviewed retrospectively from a single, high-volume cardiac transplant center. Clinical, angiographic, and immunologic data were collected on all patients postorthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) that had subsequent PCI. Restenosis was defined as greater than 50% stenosis at the previous intervention site. PCI was successfully performed on 62 de novo lesions in 40 patients an average of 6.8+/-3.9 years after OHT. Angiographic follow-up data was available for 79%, with an average follow-up of 1.54+/-1.22 years. The 1-year restenosis rate was 49% (64% for balloon percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and 33% for coronary stenting [P=0.09 for difference]). The frequency of immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibody to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen was highly associated with risk of restenosis (hazard ratio [HR] 11.33, P=0.01). Greater stenosis severity and smaller target vessel diameter were also predictors of restenosis as in the nontransplant population. The findings suggest that in patients postPCI for CAV, humoral allo-immunity may contribute to restenosis and that IgG antibodies to MHC class I antigen may help predict the risk of restenosis after PCI in this population.
