The University of Vienna experience in heart transplantation. Since the University of Vienna Cardiac Transplant Program began in 1984, 892 heart transplant procedures have been performed through the end of 2001. One- and five-year survival has increased steadily over time to 80% and 75%, respectively, in the most recent cohort. Ten-year survival is 55%. Over the past 10 years our program has seen dramatic changes in patient selection, accepting now patients with more risk factors (age, diabetes, elevated pulmonary resistance,..). Developments in immunosuppression have decreased the incidence of infection, rejection and graft arteriosclerosis continuously. Our program continues to pursue novel strategies to improve the survival and quality of life of our heart transplant patients.
