Current outcome of heart transplantation: a 10-year single centre perspective and review. Heart transplantation (HTx), the gold standard therapy for advanced heart failure, is limited by donor availability; alternative therapies are now becoming available. We examined the outcome of HTx with current immunosuppressive and adjunctive therapy. We analysed the outcome of 399 consecutive patients who underwent transplantation at our centre (1995-2007). Prior to HTx 23% (98) required inotropic support, 8.5% (34) an intra-aortic balloon pump and 11% (43) a ventricular assist device. Actuarial patient survival was 86% at 30 days, 79% at 1 year and 62% at 10 years. Survival was similar regardless of the heart failure severity, P=0.22. The cumulative incidence of allograft vasculopathy, Costanzo grade≥2, was 7% at 5 years and 23% by 10 years with an 11% cumulative probability of requiring a percutaneous coronary intervention by 10 years. Allograft function was preserved with a mean±SD left ventricular ejection fraction of 73±7% at 1 year and 74±8% at 10 years. The cumulative incidence of malignancy by 10 years was 27% (skin malignancy 13% and post transplant lymphoproliferative diseases 10%). The cumulative incidence of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate≤45 ml/min/1.73 m2 was 42% at 1 year, 62% at 5 years and 72% at 10 years and of requiring long-term renal replacement therapy was 10.6% at 10 years. HTx provided good medium-term survival for patients with advanced heart failure, independent of its severity. The incidence of allograft vasculopathy was lower than reported previously but malignancy and CKD remain cause for concern.
