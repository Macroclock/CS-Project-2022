Primary immunosuppression and outcome differences after heart transplantation: tacrolimus versus cyclosporine. The superiority of tacrolimus (Tac) as primary immunosuppression for heart transplantation (HT) compared with cyclosporine (CsA) is still under debate. Outcomes of comparison studies are not consistent; the duration of these studies has been limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term outcomes of patients undergoing HT based on primary immunosuppression regime. We analyzed a single-center registry of all HT patients between 1998 and 2009, comparing outcomes based on primary immunosuppressions (Tac or CsA). Patients who died before starting immunosuppression were excluded. A total of 197 patients entered the study; 103 received Tac and 94 CsA. There were no differences between groups in baseline characteristics, United Network for Organ Sharing status 1A or ventricular assist device use, except for ischemia time (195 ± 50 min in Tac group vs 182 ± 55 min in CsA; P = .08) and days on waiting list (164 ± 155 vs 100 ± 73; P < .001). After mean follow-ups of 4.5 ± 2.3 years in the Tac group and 6.3 ± 4.3 years in the CsA group, there were 19 and 36 deaths, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed increased survival for the Tac group (log rank P = .04). Tac also was significantly superior to CsA regarding mortality (relative risk 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.98; P = .04). In our series the use of tacrolimus resulted in improved long-term survival compared with cyclosporine. At 1-year follow-up, there were no differences in acute rejection episodes or the appearance of vasculopathy.
