Heart and lung transplantation pathology: the Padua experience. Physicians caring for heart and lung transplantation patients utilize routine follow-up biopsies on a prearranged schedule unrelated to the suspicion of a clinical diagnosis of rejection. Of course biopsies are also performed outside the prearranged scheme at any time the clinician is puzzled by clinical suspicion of rejection or infections. Technical considerations are important in handling the biopsies; pathologists who are aware of bias produced by tissue processing are forced to serially section the samples to increase the sensitivity for detection of the pathological processes. During the 20 years since the first Italian cardiac transplantation was performed in our center, 600 patients have been transplanted and monitored with 12,386 endomyocardial biopsies. The overall 5-year mortality was 24.5% and 18.4% in pediatric populations; at 10 years, 34%, and at 19 years, 55%. There was a progressive decrease in mortality from 36.8% in 1985 to 1990 to 12% in the 1996 to 2000. During a decade of experience in lung transplantation from May 1995 to May 2005 (n = 129), all patients underwent surveillance bronchoscopy including transbronchial biopsy (n = 722) and bronchoalveolar lavage (n = 629). The ancillary techniques of immunohistochemistry and molecular analysis have allowed the pathologists to play a pivotal role in the pre- and posttransplant management of patients requiring thoracic organ transplantation.
