Two decades of cardiac transplantation at the Montreal Heart Institute. The first heart transplantation in Canada was performed in 1968 at the Montreal Heart Institute (Montreal, Quebec). After nine patients transplanted in the precyclosporine era, the program was stopped. With the advent of cyclosporine, the program was reactivated in 1983. To review the experience of the Montreal Heart Institute with heart transplantation between 1983 and 2005. Three hundred patients underwent heart transplantation and were followed at the transplant clinic. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1--first decade (1983 to 1993, n=145) and group 2--second decade (1994 to 2005, n=155). There were 125 men (86%) and 20 women (14%) with a mean age of 45+/-10 years in group 1 compared with 118 men (76%) and 37 women (24%) with a mean age of 48+/-12 years in group 2 (P=0.03 and P=0.02, respectively). Indications for transplantation included congestive heart failure and/or ischemic heart disease in the majority of patients of both groups, with 83% in group 1 and 73% in group 2, respectively. In group 1, 30 patients (21%) required preoperative pharmacological support and 13 patients (9%) were on mechanical support compared with 16 (10%) and 34 (22%) patients in group 2 (P<0.01). The mean age of donors was 27+/-10 years and 34+/-13 years in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P<0.01). Major causes of mortality for donors included a motor vehicle accident in 65 cases (45%) and brain hemorrhage in 43 cases (30%) in group 1 compared with 34 cases (22%) and 68 cases (44%) in group 2 donors (P<0.01). The one-, five- and 10-year actuarial survival rates were 86%, 77% and 71%, respectively, in group 1 compared with 84%, 80% and 68%, respectively, in group 2 (P=0.95). The one-, five- and 10-year freedom from rejection rates were 35%, 28% and 25%, respectively, in group 1 compared with 41%, 36% and 33%, respectively, in group 2 (P=0.13). The one-, five- and 10-year freedom from infection rates were 38%, 24% and 17%, respectively, in group 1 compared with 37%, 23% and 19%, respectively, in group 2 (P=0.72). The one- and five-year freedom from graft coronary artery disease rates were 93% and 67%, respectively, in group 1 compared with 88% and 81%, respectively, in group 2 (P<0.01). The one-, five- and 10-year cancer-free survival rates were 98%, 91% and 73%, respectively, in group 1 compared with 98%, 90% and 77%, respectively, in group 2 (P=0.76). Patients who underwent heart transplantation in the second decade of the investigators' experience were older and in worse preoperative clinical condition; the donors were also older. However, survival and event-free survival rates remained similar throughout both periods.
