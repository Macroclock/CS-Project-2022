Is heart transplantation for complex congenital heart disease a good option? A 25-year single centre experience. Heart transplantation (HTx) in patients with complex congenital heart disease (CHD) is a challenge because of structural anomalies and multiple previous procedures. We analysed our results in adult and paediatric patients to evaluate outcome and assess risk factors affecting mortality. Between 1985 and 2011, among 839 patients who underwent HTx, 85 received transplantation for end-stage CHD. Patients were divided into four age subgroups: <1 year (8 patients, Group I), 1-10 years (20 patients, Group II), 11-18 years (24 patients, Group III) and >18 years (33 patients, Group IV) and into two time periods: 1985-2000 (47 patients) and 2001-2011 (38 patients). Anatomical diagnoses were single-ventricle defect in 37 patients (44%) and two-ventricle defect in 48 patients (56%). Seventy-three patients (86%) had undergone one or more cardiac surgical procedures prior to HTx (mean 2.4 ± 0.9). Twenty-two of them were suffering from Fontan failure. Mean pulmonary artery pressure was 25.2 ± 14.2 mmHg. Mean transpulmonary gradient was 9.4 ± 6.9 mmHg. Mean follow-up after HTx was 7.8 ± 6.8 years. Survival at 1 month was 37.7% in Group I, 85.8% in Group II, 96.8% in Group II and 98.4% in Group IV and was significantly worse in younger recipients. Overall 30-day mortality was 17.6%. Currently 56 patients (65.8%) are alive. Overall survival at 1, 5, 10 and 15 years is 83-, 73-, 67- and 58%, respectively. There were 14 late deaths. Univariate analysis found that risk factors for early and late death were those related to recipient illness, such as pre-transplant creatinine, intravenous inotropic drugs, intravenous diuretics, mechanical ventilation and presence of protein-losing enteropathy (PLE). Multivariate analysis for all events (early and late deaths) identified preoperative mechanical ventilation as an independent risk factor for mortality. Number of previous procedures did not influence survival. Previous Fontan procedure did not increase mortality. We documented the reversibility of PLE in survivors. We demonstrated that heart transplantation for patients with CHD can be performed with the expectation of excellent results. Previous procedures, including the Fontan operation, do not reduce survival. Mortality is related to preoperative patient condition. We advocate early referral of complex CHD patients for transplant assessment and for inclusion in waiting lists before the detrimental effects of end-stage failure manifest themselves.
