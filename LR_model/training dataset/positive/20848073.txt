[Cardiovascular rehabilitation]. Cardiovascular rehabilitation encompasses the optimization of secondary prevention to reduce morbidity and mortality, the improvement of physical fitness and quality of life as well as the reintegration into social life and employment. This requires a multifactorial intervention on the physical, psychological, educative and social level by a multidisciplinary team. In Germany, cardiac rehabilitation started early after an index event, could demonstrate a significant reduction of total mortality, myocardial infarction and hospitalization during a follow-up of 1-2 years in 4 cohort studies including 10,758 patients with myocardial infarction and bypass surgery. This reduction of clinical events was obtained in addition to rapid revascularization therapy during the acute coronary event and on top of an evidence based secondary preventive medication. By national and international medical societies, cardiac rehabilitation is recommended as well in patients with congestive heart failure, after valve replacement or valve repair, after heart transplantation and cardioverter/defibrillator implantation. In the future, cardiac rehabilitation in Germany should be evaluated by a randomized controlled trial and multifactorial interventions should be tailored individually to specific patient subgroups and medical conditions.
