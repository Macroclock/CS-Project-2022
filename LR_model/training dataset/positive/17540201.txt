Long-term patency of internal thoracic artery grafts for coronary artery stenosis due to Kawasaki disease: comparison of early with recent results in small children. The results of coronary artery bypass grafting using the internal thoracic artery (ITA) had been reported less satisfactory in patients < 12 years old with coronary artery lesions caused by Kawasaki disease. Since 1983, 67 patients have undergone this operation in our hospital; their age at operation ranged from 1 to 59 years (median 11 years), and the total number of ITA grafts was 95. The interval from operation to latest graft patency as confirmed by angiogram or echocardiogram ranged from 4 months to 23 years (median 8 years). For analysis of graft patency rates, patients were divided into 4 groups based on year of coronary artery bypass grafting and age when grafted. The groups based on year were from 1983 to 1993 (early) and from 1994 to 2006 (later), whereas the age groups were age at operation < 12 years and age at operation > or = 12 years. From 1999, percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty was performed for postoperative anastomotic stenosis. Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty for anastomotic stenosis in ITA graft was performed in 6 patients. When the age at operation was < 12 years, the 10-year patency rate in the later period was 94.4% (n = 18), significantly > the 70.0% (n = 30) seen in the earlier period (P < .05). Recent results of ITA grafts in patients < 12 years old have improved through the application of appropriate indications and percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty for anastomotic stenosis. Once good flow in the ITA 1 year after surgery is confirmed, graft patency will persist > 20 years.
