Renal graft outcome in combined heart-kidney transplantation compared to kidney transplantation alone: a single-center, matched-control study. Renal allograft outcome in heart-kidney transplantation (HKTx) might be affected by hemodynamic instability and high levels of calcineurin inhibitor-dependent immunosuppression. From November 1999 to March 2008, 13 patients who received HKTx were compared with a matched control group of 13 kidney transplantation (KTx) recipients with similar cardiovascular risk factors. Graft function, rejection periods, and patient survival were analyzed. Renal allograft rejection was noted in three patients (23%) after HKTx and in four patients (31%) after KTx. Serum creatinine levels were comparable at 1 week, 1 month, 1, 2, and 3 years after transplantation. Patient survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 100% for HKTx recipients and 100, 92, and 92% for isolated KTx patients. Graft survival was 92% at 1, 2, and 3 years after HKTx and 100% at 1 year and 92% at 2 and 3 years after isolated KTx. Our results with excellent long-term graft function and survival after combined HKTx indicate that this procedure is a valuable option for a growing number of patients suffering from coexistent cardiac and renal failure.
