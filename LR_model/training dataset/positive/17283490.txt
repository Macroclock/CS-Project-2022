The outcome of heart transplant recipients following the development of end-stage renal disease: analysis of the Canadian Organ Replacement Register (CORR). End-stage renal disease is a significant complication of heart transplantation (HTx), but our understanding of dialysis outcomes in HTx recipients remains limited. We performed a retrospective analysis looking at dialysis mortality in HTx recipients as compared to a matched dialysis cohort. We also examined outcomes with respect to kidney transplantation (KTx) in these cohorts. 2709 incident HTx recipients were captured from the Canadian Organ Replacement Register between 1981 and 2002. The incidence of dialysis after HTx was 3.9% (n = 105) and carried a greater crude mortality compared to HTx recipients not requiring dialysis (56.2% vs. 35.9%, p < 0.001). Compared to the matched dialysis cohort, survival of HTx patients on dialysis was also significantly worse (19% vs. 40%, p = 0.003). In those receiving a KTx, survival did not differ between the two cohorts; however, in those that did not receive a KTx the survival was significantly lower in the dialysis post-HTx group compared to the matched dialysis cohort (15.7% vs. 35.2%, p < 0.025). Our analysis suggests mortality on dialysis following HTx is greater than would be expected from a similar dialysis population, and KTx may abrogate some of this increased risk. Attention should be placed on preventing chronic kidney disease progression following HTx.
