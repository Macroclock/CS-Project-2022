Heart transplantation in adults with congenital heart disease: experience with 15 patients. End-stage congenital heart disease (CHD) is an important indication for pediatric heart transplantation (HTx) as well as transplantation in adult populations. The purpose of this retrospective analysis was to compare the survival rate of adults who underwent HTx for end-stage CHD with those who underwent HTx for other causes. To find out whether HTx is a viable therapeutic option for adult patients with preoperated CHD, data from 15 adult patients with different forms of CHD, who had previously undergone different corrective and palliative procedures, were retrospectively analyzed and compared with the HTx data of 1400 adult patients (>15 years old) whose indications for HTx were other than end-stage CHD. From 1989 to 2005, 15 adult patients (eight men/seven women) were given transplantation for end-stage CHD. Ten patients had been preoperated once, five patients twice. Their mean age was 34.06 +/- 3.9 years. In five cases, patients had development of acute renal failure. One female patient died 40 days after surgery, after having a cerebral infarction; one male patient died 4 years after HTx for OKT 3 monoclonal antibody-resistant rejection; and two patients died as the result of multiple organ failure at 4 days and 30 days after HTx, respectively; 11 patients are still alive. The cumulative survival rate at 1 year is 80% versus 80% in patients given transplantation for noncongenital indications. Heart transplantation in adults with end-stage CHD can be performed with a good long-term prognosis. Previous palliative operations do not affect outcome after HTx.
