Mortality after heart transplantation in adults with congenital heart disease: a single-center experience. The number of congenital heart disease (CHD) patients transplanted to date is small. The results are comparable to those undergoing heart transplantation (HT) for other etiologies. However, advances in pediatric surgery over recent years (eg, the Fontan procedure) has increased the demand for HT by a growing number of children who reach adulthood and who also have a different profile. We analyzed the clinical profile and survival of our CHD patients compared with other etiologies. From July 17, 1991 to December 31, 2006, eight HT were performed in our center for CHD. A descriptive study determined the baseline characteristics and survival of these patients, compared with those of the overall transplant group and other subgroups (dilated cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease). Mean age was 26 years. Four (50%) CHD patients were diagnosed with single-ventricle anatomy, associated or not with other lesions; none had been operated with the Fontan procedure. Two patients died prematurely. Early, 1-, and 10-year survival was 75% at each time point. Early, 1-, and 10-year survival in the group with other diagnoses was 90%, 78%, and 60%, respectively, and in the dilated cardiomyopathy group it was 94%, 86%, and 72%, respectively. The current number of CHD transplant patients was small and young. The most common etiology was single-ventricle anatomy without a prior Fontan operation. Overall survival was comparable to HT for dilated cardiomyopathy.
