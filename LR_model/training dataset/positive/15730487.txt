Low incidence of malignancy after transplantation in Chinese heart allograft recipients. This study sought to assess the incidence of neoplastic disease after transplantation in Chinese heart allograft recipients. A total of 156 patients (130 male and 26 female; mean age, 45.8 +/- 15.7 years), surviving more than 30 days after transplantation, were enrolled in this study. The mean follow up duration was 51.2 +/- 33.0 months. Six patients (3.8%) developed neoplastic diseases after transplantation: post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases in four and solid tumors in two patients. There was no skin cancer or Kaposi's sarcoma. Solid tumors affected the prostate, liver and urinary bladder in two patients. The cumulative incidence of neoplastic disease was 2.1% at 1 year, 3.6% at 5 years, and 10.1% at 10 years after transplantation. The incidence of post-transplant neoplastic disease was low in Chinese heart allograft recipients. It resulted from a relative paucity of Kaposi's sarcoma and skin cancers in Chinese population.
