A comparative analysis of outcome after heart transplantation in patients aged 60 years and older: the University of Alberta experience. The Registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) 2001 Annual Report indicated that the vast majority of heart transplant recipients are between 50 and 64 years of age. However, patient age beyond 60 years may have higher long-term mortality compared to younger patients. The purpose of this study was to compare short- and intermediate-term results including rates of acute rejection, transplant coronary artery disease, infections, malignancy, and mortality in cardiac transplant recipients 60 years or older with those below the age of 60 years. We retrospectively analyzed the results of 50 patients aged 60 years and older who underwent heart transplantation at the University of Alberta from January 1990 to December 2000 and compared them with the results of 225 younger patients undergoing heart transplantation in the same time period. The older and younger groups had similar rates for treated acute rejection episodes (20.0% vs. 12.6%), transplant coronary artery disease (4.0% vs. 1.1%), and mortality (10.5% vs. 14.3%), respectively. No differences were noted with regards to quality and quantity of infection or malignancy rates. Five-year actuarial survival between the older and younger patients was also comparable at 89.5% vs.86.9% (p > 0.05). Heart transplantation in patients 60 years of age and older can be performed as successfully as in younger patients (< 60 years) with comparable morbidity and mortality, suggesting that patient age per se should not be an exclusion criterion for heart transplantation.
