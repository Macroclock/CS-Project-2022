Pre-existing elevated pulmonary vascular resistance: long-term hemodynamic follow-up and outcome of recipients after orthotopic heart transplantation. Elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) has been considered to predict a bad outcome after orthotopic heart transplantation (HTx). A transpulmonary gradient (TG) > or =15 mmHg and PVR > or =5 wood (w) are correlated with a three-fold increase in 2-days as well as 30-days and 6-, 12-month mortality. We performed a retrospective analysis of 400 consecutive transplanted patients (pts) on hemodynamic data over a time period of 3.5 years. In 83 pts (23%) preoperative PVR was > or =5 w and TG >15 mmHg. Vasodilator studies were performed in this group of pts in order to evaluate pulmonary vasoreactivity or hemodynamic improvement. Hemodynamic follow-up post-transplantation showed a significant (p<0.001) decrease in mean TG to 8.8 mmHg within the first, 7.7 after the fifth year as well as decrease in PVR from 5.5 to 1.6, within the first and fifth year post-transplantation. Compared to the control group (n=286) (re-transplants n=6 and pediatric pts n=25 excluded) pts with TG <15 mmHg and/or PVR <5 w, transplanted within the same period, 30-day mortality and cumulative survival after 1 and 5 years do not show any significant difference with a mortality of 3%, 22% and 33% (p<0.05). Subgroup analysis for pts with endstage of ischemic versus dilatative cardiomyopathy has not shown any significant difference in mortality. In a retrospective analysis of 400 pts elevated PVR does not predict a bad outcome after orthotopic heart transplantation in early and late mortality.
