[Changes in patient survival and quality of life after heart transplantation]. Heart transplantation was performed firstly in 1967, but it became a valuable option in the 1980s, due to the availability of cyclosporine and of the technique for rejection monitoring by means of serial endomyocardial biopsies. Post-transplant survival improved over the years, mainly due to a reduction in early mortality for infection or acute rejection. Expected 1-year and 5-year survivals are around 85% and 70%, respectively. During the past 20-30 years, better therapies for heart failure have been developed, leading to restriction of heart transplant candidacy to truly refractory heart failure. On the contrary, the criteria for donor acceptance have been liberalized, due to the discrepancy between heart transplant candidates and available organs. It must be kept in mind that renal and/or hepatic insufficiency that may be a consequence of heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and donor age, all remain risk factors for mortality after transplantation. In order to maintain and possibly improve the results of heart transplantation, effective strategies to increase safely the donor pool are of utmost importance. Moreover, long-term post-transplant recipients present new challenges to research and clinical practice. Mechanical circulatory support devices represent a surgical bridge or an alternative to transplantation; their expansion is limited by costs, organizational burden, and by patient difficulties in accepting this therapy.
