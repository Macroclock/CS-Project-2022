Strategies for maximizing heart and lung transplantation opportunities in Japan. Because the donor shortage is extremely severe in Japan because of a strict organ transplantation law, special strategies must be established to maximize heart transplantation (HTx) and lung transplantation (LTx) opportunities. The purpose of this study was to review our strategies to identify and manage heart and lung donors. Transplantation doctors themselves assessed their own donor heart and lung function before starting the procurement operation; skillful staff surgeons harvested the organs. Since November 2002, a special transplantation consultant doctor assessed donor organ function to identify useful organs and intensively cared for the donor to improve cardiac and lung function. Only 63 brain-dead donors have been available in Japan. However, 49 HTx (77.7%) and 39 LTx (19 bilateral and 20 single) were performed from 36 donors (57.1%). Thirty-six HTx donors were marginal, requiring sustained high doses of inotropes (n = 26), low left ventricular ejection fraction (n = 5), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (n = 15), and age older than 55 years (n = 6). Twenty LTx donors had infected sputa or showed pneumonia using chest X-ray. None of 49 HTx recipients died of primary graft failure (PGF). Patient survival at 3 years after HTx was 98.0%. Although 5/39 LTx died early, including 2 of PGF, patient survival rate at 3 years was 66.9%. Although the number of cases was still small, the availability of hearts and lungs has been high and the transplantation outcomes were acceptable. These strategies may be useful to maximize HTx/LTx opportunities.
