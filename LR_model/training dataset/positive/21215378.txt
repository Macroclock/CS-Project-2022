Third INTERMACS Annual Report: the evolution of destination therapy in the United States. The third annual report of the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) provides documentation of the current landscape of durable mechanical circulatory support in the United States. With nearly 3,000 patients entered into the database, the transition to continuous-flow pump technology is evident and dramatic. This report focuses on the rapidly expanding experience with mechanical circulatory support as destination therapy. The current 1-year survival of 75% with continuous-flow destination therapy provides a benchmark for the evolving application of this therapy.
