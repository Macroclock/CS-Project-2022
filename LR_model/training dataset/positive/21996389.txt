Effects of donor pre-treatment with dopamine on survival after heart transplantation: a cohort study of heart transplant recipients nested in a randomized controlled multicenter trial. We determined the outcome of cardiac allografts from multiorgan donors enrolled in a randomized trial of donor pre-treatment with dopamine. Treatment of the brain-dead donor with low-dose dopamine improves immediate graft function after kidney transplantation. A cohort study of 93 heart transplants from 21 European centers was undertaken between March 2004 and August 2007. We assessed post-transplant left ventricular function (LVF), requirement of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or biventricular assist device (BVAD), need for hemofiltration, acute rejection, and survival of recipients of a dopamine-treated versus untreated graft. Donor dopamine was associated with improved survival 3 years after transplantation (87.0% vs. 67.8%, p = 0.03). Fewer recipients of a pre-treated graft required hemofiltration after transplant (21.7% vs. 40.4%, p = 0.05). Impaired LVF (15.2% vs. 21.3%, p = 0.59), requirement of a LVAD (4.4% vs. 10.6%, p = 0.44), and biopsy-proven acute rejection (19.6% vs. 14.9%, p = 0.59) were not statistically different between groups. Post-transplant impaired LVF (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.95; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.08 to 11.79; p < 0.001), requirement of LVAD (HR: 6.65; 95% CI: 2.40 to 18.45; p < 0.001), and hemofiltration (HR: 2.83; 95% CI: 1.20 to 6.69; p = 0.02) were predictive of death. The survival benefit remained (HR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.89; p = 0.03) after adjustment for various risks affecting mortality, including pre-transplant LVAD/BVAD, inotropic support, and impaired kidney function. Treatment of brain-dead donors with dopamine of 4 Î¼g/kg/min will not harm cardiac allografts but appears to improve the clinical course of the heart allograft recipient.
