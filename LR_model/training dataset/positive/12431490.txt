Recipient selection in cardiac transplantation: contraindications and risk factors for mortality. Currently the only acknowledged, definitive treatment for refractory heart failure is heart transplantation (HTx). During the past 10 years, selection criteria for heart transplant recipients have been developed that use an analysis of risk factors associated with mortality, which were identified by consensus opinion and by single-center and multi-center database review. A number of other studies also have been designed to evaluate specific risk factors for transplant such as advanced age, diabetes, and sex. This review identifies variables that continue to provoke controversy during the candidate selection process or variables that have changed from absolute to relative contraindications for HTx. Clinicians may use the data summarized in this review as a guide to making decisions about patient candidacy for HTx. One could conclude from this analysis that a more formalized and objective scale to select patients and to assess risk of death after HTx is necessary. Moreover, as alternative therapies to HTx become reality, a better instrument for triaging patients to one form of therapy or another may be necessary.
