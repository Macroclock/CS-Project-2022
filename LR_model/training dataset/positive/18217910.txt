Influence of immunosuppressive regimens on short-term morbidity and mortality in heart transplantation. The goal of immunosuppressive therapy in heart transplantation is to maximize safety and efficacy while minimizing morbidity and mortality. We now have numerous drug combinations, but few have been compared with each other. To compare various immunosuppressive regimens assessing morbidity and mortality at one yr. A total of 351 patients transplanted between 1989 and 2005 were included and grouped by immunosuppressive regimen into group 1 (n = 52): Muronomab (OKT3) 10 d, cyclosporine (CSA), azathioprine (AZA), steroids; group 2 (n = 193): OKT3 seven d, CSA, AZA, steroids; group 3 (n = 22): OKT3 seven d, CSA, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), steroids; and group 4 (n = 84): interleukin-2 antagonists (IL-2), CSA, MMF, steroids. The incidence of acute graft failure and treated rejection was similar between groups (17% and 78% respectively). We found a statistically significant difference in the incidence of infections (p < 0.001), renal dysfunction (p = 0.011) and in diabetes mellitus (p = 0.023). There were no differences in survival at 30 d (97%), but differences were found at one yr (p = 0.011). The multivariate analysis showed a strong association between mortality and infection (p = 0.001) and between survival and the group 4 regimen (p < 0.001). There are differences in survival at one yr of heart transplant patients depending on the immunosuppressive regimen used. The best combination was induction with IL-2 antagonists, followed by CSA, MMF and steroids.
