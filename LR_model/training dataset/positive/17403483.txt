Varicella infection after heart and lung transplantation: a single-center experience. Disseminated varicella-zoster virus infection after organ transplantation in adults is a rare but serious event causing significant morbidity and mortality. We describe our 10-year experience of 13 cases in a single center, including risk factors for infection, lack of protection from pre-existing anti-varicella-zoster virus antibodies, and unusual modes of presentation, including disseminated intravascular coagulation. We also report our preliminary observation of resolution of infection without sequelae in 4 patients with severe disseminated varicella-zoster virus infection who were treated with the combination of intravenous acyclovir and polyspecific intravenous immunoglobulin.
