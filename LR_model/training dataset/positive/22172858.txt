Comparison of heart transplantation patients with ischemic and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. We retrospectively analyzed our data to compare preoperative demographic, laboratory, echocardiographic, hemodynamic findings mortality and survival rates of heart transplantation patients with ischemic (ICM) and idiopathic dilated (IDCM) cardiomyopathy. The data of 144 patients transplanted from February 1998 to January 2011 were analyzed. 38 patients with ischemic ICM and 86 patients with IDCM were compared. Recipient age, preoperative creatinine, recipient body mass index, intraoperative cross-clamp time, donor male sex ratio, recipient male sex ratio, hyperlipidemia ratio, and previous nitrate use were significantly higher and left ventricular end systolic diameter significantly lower in patients with ICM. Major causes of death after heart transplantation were infections (31.9%), right ventricle failure (14.8%), and sudden cardiac death (14.8%). Causes of death were not different between the groups. Overall mortality in the entire population was 37.9% (47/124), and it was not different between the groups (39.5% vs 37.2%; P=.48). Early mortality (<30 days) rate was 11.2% (14/124), late mortality rate was 26.6% (33/124), and no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups. Survival analysis showed that ICM patients were not associated with worse survival compared with IDCM (71.1% vs 81.1% after 1 year, 68.1% vs 73.0% at 2 years, and 54.2% vs 62.3% at 5 years; log rank=0.57). Multivariate analysis showed that the only predictor of mortality was preoperative urea level and that heart failure etiology was not a predictor of this end point. Patients with ICM had similar survival and mortality rate compared with IDCM.
