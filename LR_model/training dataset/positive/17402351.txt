[Coronary allograft vasculopathy: pathophysiological interaction between the immune system, infections and metabolic syndrome]. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is still the main cause of long-term graft loss after heart transplantation. Indeed, recent advances in immunosuppression management led to a significant improvement in short-term survival, while long-term death rate did not change significantly in the last 20 years. In this paper, we will review the latest advances in the understanding of this peculiar form of atherosclerosis, focusing on the mechanisms that can be potentially targeted by specific therapeutic interventions.
