Cardiopulmonary transplantation for congenital heart disease in the adult. Patients surviving into adulthood with congenital heart disease (CHD) often succumb to progressive cardiopulmonary dysfunction. For these patients transplantation is often considered. We performed a retrospective review of 69 adults (age >18 years) with CHD transplanted between 1984 and 1999. We evaluated 31 heart-lung (HLTxp), 30 lung (LTxp), and 8 heart (HTxp) transplants performed in 22 men and 47 women with CHD. Mean age was 37 +/- 10 years with a mean follow-up of 3.1 +/- 3.5 years. A concomitant cardiovascular procedure was performed in 1 HLTxp, 23 LTxp, and 2 HTxp. Early mortality (>30 days) was 26% (8/31) for HLTxp, mostly due to bleeding. Early LTxp mortality was 23% (7/30), largely due to graft failure. One and 3-year survival was similar in adults transplanted for CHD and adults transplanted for other disease. Early mortality among HTxp recipients was 50% (4/8) from rejection or technical complications. Survival for patients undergoing HLTxp versus LTxp with cardiac repair was similar. When examined by era, the survival of patients transplanted for CHD between 1992 and 1999 was greater than that of patients transplanted between 1984 and 1991. Adults undergoing HLTxp and LTxp for CHD can expect survival comparable to that of non-CHD adults. In the presence of a reparable cardiac lesion, LTxp with cardiovascular repair for CHD is an attractive option, optimizing organ allocation. Specific technical concerns are discussed. Survival of adults undergoing cardiopulmonary transplantation for CHD has improved over time.
