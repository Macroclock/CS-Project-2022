Heart transplantation at Cheng Hsin General Hospital in Taiwan: 15-year experience. Heart transplantation (HTx) in Taiwan, which started in 1987, now includes more than 500 cases. From July 1988 to September 2003, we performed 215 cases of orthotopic HTx in 164 male and 51 female recipients of mean age of 47.3 +/- 14.3 years, (range 2.7 to 74.9 years). The leading etiologies were dilated cardiomyopathy (CMP), 68.5%; ischemic CMP, 20.2%; and valvular CMP, 4.2%. The actuarial survival rates at 1, 5, and 10 years are 88.3%, 77.1%, and 57.2%, respectively. We performed the first case of HTx in Asia after bridging for 14 days with an indigenous total artificial heart (TAH; the Phoenix-7 model); we performed the first case of infant HTx without blood transfusion and also the first case of autotransplantation of heart for repair of a left ventricular rupture after a mitral valve replacement. These cases were all successful with the longest surviving HTx recipient in Asia. We have used the biatrial anastomosis technique in all cases. We discovered familial CMP due to mitochondrial defects in two pediatric cases. Because of the scarcity of donor hearts, we have used size-mismatched hearts as well as suboptimal and hepatitis-positive donor hearts, all with satisfactory outcomes. Our experience has shown comparable results to Western programs, with efficacy and cost-effectiveness. We find the technique of biatrial anastomosis for orthotopic HTx to result in a low incidence of tricuspid regurgitation and conduction anomalies. The use of suboptimal and size-mismatched donor hearts is also promising.
