Lung and heart lung transplantation at the University of Alberta 1986-2010. The lung transplantation program at the University of Alberta has been in existence for 25 years. The current volume is 35-40 new lung transplants per year. We offer single-lung, bilateral lung, heart/lung and bilateral living lobar transplantation as options. Experience has allowed for widening of the indications and acceptance of patients with more risk. Donor evaluation and management has allowed for extended donors to be included in the donor pool. Results will likely continue to improve with increased understanding of the mechanisms and management of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Our research interests have been in the areas of risk analysis, outcome assessment, and quality of life changes from transplantation.
