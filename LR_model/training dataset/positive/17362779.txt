Results after orthotopic heart transplantation accepting donor hearts >50 years: experience at La Pitie Salpetriere, Paris. We sought to examine the results of orthotopic heart transplantation accepting hearts from donors >50 years of age with special regard to the usefulness of peripheral extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for posttransplant graft dysfunction. Between January 2000 and December 2004, a total of 247 patients underwent orthotopic heart transplantation. In 143 patients (58%) the heart donor was <50 years (group I, mean age of donor hearts 36 +/- 11 years; range, 8-49 years). In 104 recipients (42%) the heart donor was >50 years (group II, mean age of donor hearts 56 +/- 15 years; range, 50-67 years). Pretransplant characteristics of the two groups showed no significant differences. The in-hospital mortality was slightly increased in group II (24% vs 20% in group I, NS) and the 5-year survival rate significantly increased in group I (75% vs 63% in group II). Freedom from transplant vasculopathy after 3 years was similar in both groups (86% in group I vs 87% in group II). A total of 25 patients (17%) in group I and 27 patients (26%) in group II developed graft dysfunction. Eleven patients in group I and 10 patients in group II were treated using peripheral extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, whereas 3 of the 11 patients in group I and 5 of the 10 patients in group II were discharged following a complete recovery. Two patients in group I and 4 patients in group II were survivors beyond year. In our experience it was possible to increase the cardiac donor pool by accepting allografts from donors >50 years of age in selected cases. The incidence of transplant vasculopathy was not increased, whereas in-hospital mortality was slightly higher. In our limited cohort, patients with older donor hearts was developed graft dysfunction profited from primary extracorporeal membrane oxygenation implantation, an indication that should be examined further without delay.
