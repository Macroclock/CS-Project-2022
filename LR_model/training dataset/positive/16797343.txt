Improved survival with statins, angiotensin receptor blockers, and steroid weaning after heart transplantation. Various immunosuppressive and adjunctive pharmacological regimens exist for cardiac transplantation, though the associations between these regimens and long-term survival are unclear. We reviewed demographic, clinical, and pharmacological data from 220 consecutive adult heart transplant recipients between 1986 and 2003 who survived beyond 3 months. Immunosuppression was cyclosporine-based (n=94) or tacrolimus-based (n=126), and 104 patients were weaned off steroids (all receiving tacrolimus). Covariates of mortality were assessed in a Cox proportional hazards analysis. The mean age was 5.2+/-13 years. Survival was 96%, 88%, and 81% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Significant covariates associated with mortality included pretransplant diabetes mellitus (hazard ratio [HR] 2.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45 to 5.04), black race (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.94), higher pretransplant creatinine clearance (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00), steroid withdrawal (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.85), and exposure to a statin (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.70) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.95) after transplantation. Treatment with a statin, an angiotensin receptor blocker, and steroid withdrawal were each associated with improved survival in heart transplant recipients. These findings warrant prospective study, with specific emphasis on identifying the clinical effects of these medications in transplant recipients.
