Recent trends in heart transplantation: the University of Vienna experience. Since the beginning of the University of Vienna Cardiac Transplant Program in 1984, 1086 heart transplant procedures have been performed through the end of 2007. One- and five-year survival has increased steadily over time (82% and 76%). Ten-year survival is 65%. Over the past 10 years our program has seen dramatic changes in patient selection, accepting now patients with more risk factors (Age, diabetes, elevated pulmonary resistance,..). Developments in immunosuppression have decreased incidence of infection, rejection and graft arteriosclerosis continuously. Our program continues to pursue novel strategies to improve the survival and quality of life of our heart transplant patients.
