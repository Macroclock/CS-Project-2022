Treatment goals during care of adult donors that can influence outcomes of heart transplantation. Myocardial dysfunction during care of adult donors can result from injury occurring before hospital admission or during the progression of brain death. Few evidence-based data correlate specific hemodynamic goals during donor care with outcomes of heart transplantation, although many recommendations exist. Spontaneous reversal of early heart damage or correction of poor cardiac performance can yield outcomes equivalent to outcomes in recipients who had ideal donors. Hemodynamic goals developed in the operating room can be applied in intensive care to improve outcomes of transplantation. These goals include maintenance of mean arterial pressure greater than 60 mm Hg, central venous pressure less than 12 mm Hg, cardiac output greater than 3.8 L/min, cardiac index greater than 2.1, and systemic vascular resistance between 800 and 1200 dyne x sec x cm(-5). The ejection fraction and other echocardiographic data also provide helpful guidance when determining whether a heart is suitable for transplantation and during therapy. Titration of cardiovascular variables often requires invasive monitoring to ensure that cardiac preload, afterload, and contractility are optimal.
