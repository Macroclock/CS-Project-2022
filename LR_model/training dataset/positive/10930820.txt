Pulmonary vascular resistance and reactivity in children with end-stage cardiomyopathy. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and reactivity were compared in 63 children with end-stage cardiomyopathy (CM) referred for cardiac transplantation. Diagnostic category of CM was the sole determinant of PVR. Compared with other patients, children with restrictive CM were younger at diagnosis and had a significantly higher pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI). Children with a baseline PVRI of up to 11.8 units per meter squared (U.m(2)) who showed reactivity underwent successful orthotopic cardiac transplantation.
