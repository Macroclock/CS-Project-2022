Heart transplantation for end-stage valvular disease: indications and results. The aim of this study is to appraise the indications of a small group of heart transplanted patients with valvular disease, to analyse both their particular issues and results compared with the etiologies of other transplanted patients. Analysis of recent data shows that valvular patients represent between 3 and 5% of transplantation indications. This proportion of valvular patients had a tendency to decrease in many countries. These patients on the whole have undergone multiple reoperations. Pulmonary resistance analysis has to be especially rigorous for this group. A primary excess mortality is directly related to multiple reoperations. Mean and long-term results are then strictly comparable with other etiologies. There are a few very specific indications for recurrent endocarditis in this group. Valvular patients represent a subgroup of transplanted patients with a slight primary excess mortality but with identical long-term results.
