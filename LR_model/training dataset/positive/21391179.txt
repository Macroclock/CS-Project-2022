Impact of the Eurotransplant high-urgency heart allocation system on the outcome of transplant candidates in Germany. In 2000, the Eurotransplant Foundation changed the allocation criteria following the enactment of the German Transplantation Law (GTL). Our study investigated the impact of the new allocation system on outcomes after heart transplantation (HTx) in Germany. We compared 2 cohorts of patients who underwent HTx at our institution in two different 3-year periods before (Group 1: 01/1995-12/1997) and after (Group 2: 01/2003-12/2005) implementation of the new system. An increase in the ratio of HTx performed on an urgency basis was found in Group 2 (8.3 % vs. 87.2 %; P < 0.001). The median waiting time and the ischemia time were significantly lower in Group 1 ( P < 0.05). Postoperatively, the length of ICU stay was significantly higher in Group 2 ( P = 0.04). The new allocation system decreased the proportion of local and regional organ harvesting. It generates a higher ischemia time without increasing the number of transplantations and without improving the clinical outcome after HTx. The severity of heart failure, rate of secondary organ impairment, and comorbidity is markedly elevated in patients waiting for HTx on HU.
