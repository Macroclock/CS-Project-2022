Pregnancy in heart- and heart/lung recipients can be problematic. The first successful pregnancy after heart transplantation was reported in 1988. Worldwide experience with heart and heart/lung transplanted (H-HLTx) pregnant women is limited. To expand this knowledge the collaborating Nordic thoracic transplant centers wanted to collect information on all such pregnancies from their centers. Information was retrospectively collected on all H-HLTx pregnancies in the Nordic countries. A total of 25 women have had 42 pregnancies and all survived the gestation. Minor complications were increasing incidence of proteinuria, hypertension and diabetes. Major problems were two rejections (early post partum), two severe renal failures, seven pre-eclampsias and 17 abortions. Five women died two to 12 years after delivery. Of 25 live born children, one was born with cancer and one died early after inheriting the mother's cardiomyopathy. Pregnancy after H-HLTx can be successful for both mother and child. There are, however, many obstacles which should be addressed. Respecting the couple's desire for children the attitude should be carefully, not too optimistic, after proper pre-pregnant information and counseling. Delivery should preferably take place at the transplant center.
