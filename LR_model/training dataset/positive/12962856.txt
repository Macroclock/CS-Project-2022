Acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock: treatment with mechanical circulatory assistance and heart transplantation. The mortality of cardiogenic shock (CS) after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) still remains high. Thrombolysis, PTCA or CABG, when possible, can improve the results, but when all the treatments fail death is almost certain. We investigate the use of the mechanical circulatory assistance (MCA) and heart transplantation (HT) to improve the adverse results in this irreversible situation. Among 11 patients with irreversible CS after an AMI we used a MCA (Abiomed BVS-5000). After improvement and hemodynamic stabilization, we performed heart transplantation in 7 patients of mean age 52 years (35-60) including two women. The MCA was univentricular in 7 patients and biventricular in 4. Mean duration of the MCA was 5 days (1-12). Three patients died during the MCA: two due to cerebrovascular accidents and one multiorgan failure. Weaning was possible in one patient. Among Seven transplanted patients one died due to sepsis. Seven (64%) patients are long-term survivors. When all the treatments have failed for CS after an AMI, MCA may be used as a bridge to heart transplantation in a select group of patients where the procedure is not contraindicated. The long-term results of 64% survivors in our experience is satisfactory.
