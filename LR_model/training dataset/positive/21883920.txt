Trends in wait-list mortality in children listed for heart transplantation in the United States: era effect across racial/ethnic groups. We sought to evaluate trends in overall and race-specific pediatric heart transplant (HT) wait-list mortality in the United States (US) during the last 20 years. We identified all children <18 years old listed for primary HT in the US during 1989-2009 (N = 8096, 62% White, 19% Black, 13% Hispanic and 6% Other) using the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network database. Wait-list mortality was assessed in four successive eras (1989-1994, 1995-1999, 2000-2004 and 2005-2009). Overall wait-list mortality declined in successive eras (26%, 23%, 18% and 13%, respectively). The decline across eras remained significant in adjusted analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 0.70 in successive eras, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67-0.74) and was 67% lower for children listed during 2005-2009 versus those listed during 1989-1994 (HR 0.33; CI, 0.28-0.39). In models stratified by race, wait-list mortality decreased in all racial groups in successive eras. In models stratified by era, minority children were not at higher risk of wait-list mortality in the most recent era. We conclude that the risk of wait-list mortality among US children listed for HT has decreased by two-thirds during the last 20 years. Racial gaps in wait-list mortality present variably in the past are not present in the current era.
