Influence of donor cocaine use on outcome after cardiac transplantation: analysis of the United Network for Organ Sharing Thoracic Registry. Heart transplantation from donors with a history of cocaine abuse remains controversial. Therefore, we examined the consequence of donor cocaine-use history on all-cause mortality and the development of coronary artery disease after heart transplantation. Using the United Network for Organ Sharing Thoracic Registry we identified 9,217 first-time heart-only adult transplant recipients between January 1999 and December 2003, and then divided this cohort into sub-groups based on the reported history of donor cocaine use. Multivariate analysis revealed no difference in mortality or development of coronary artery disease at 1 and 5 years between transplant recipients who received an organ from donors with a history of cocaine use when compared with donors having no history of cocaine use.
