Histologic compaison of allograft myocardium between short- and long-term survivors of human cardiac transplantation. Myocardial histology of cardiac allografts differed between short-term (<5 years) and long-term (>5 years) survivors after transplantation. These differences may partially be attributable to a higher prevalence of systemic hypertension and allograft rejection in the short-term survivors, affecting hemodynamics and allograft function.
