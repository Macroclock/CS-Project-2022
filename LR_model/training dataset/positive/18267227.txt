Cyclosporine reduction in the presence of everolimus: 3-month data from a Canadian pilot study of maintenance cardiac allograft recipients. Concentration-controlled everolimus with concomitant cyclosporine (CsA) dose reduction in renal transplantation permits preservation of kidney function without loss of efficacy. Data are lacking regarding everolimus with reduced-dose CsA in maintenance cardiac transplant patients. In a multicenter, open-label, single-arm pilot study, concentration-controlled everolimus was initiated in patients receiving CsA microemulsion (Neoral) with/without mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or azathioprine, and with/without corticosteroids. On the day of everolimus initiation, MMF/azathioprine was discontinued and CsA dose was reduced by 25% with further reductions as required in response to decreasing calculated glomerular filtration rate (cGFR). Of the 36 patients enrolled (intent-to-treat [ITT]), 27 underwent CsA dose reduction as planned (per protocol [PP]). During Week 1, the CsA dose was reduced by 23.3 +/- 7.3% in the ITT population (p < 0.0001) and 26.9 +/- 2.9% in the PP population (p < 0.0001). Mean cGFR (Nankivell) was 68.9 +/- 14.5 ml/min at baseline and 64.4 +/- 14.3 ml/min at Week 12 in the ITT population (p = 0.021), and 69.5 +/- 14.4 ml/min and 66.6 +/- 8.6 ml/min in the PP cohort (p = 0.132). cGFR at Week 12 met the criterion for non-inferiority vs baseline. One case of acute rejection of Grade >or=3A occurred (2.7%). There was no graft loss or death. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels decreased significantly, whereas cholesterol and triglyceride levels increased (all p < 0.0001). This pilot study suggests that initiation of concentration-controlled everolimus with a concomitant 25% reduction in CsA dose in maintenance heart transplant patients is associated with no significant decline in renal function, and no indication of increased rejection to Month 3 post-conversion. Evaluation of more substantial CsA dose reductions is required.
