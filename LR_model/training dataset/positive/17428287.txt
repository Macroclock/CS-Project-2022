Heart and lung transplantation in the United States, 1996-2005. This article examines the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data on heart and lung transplantation in the United States from 1996 to 2005. The number of heart transplants performed and the size of the heart waiting list continued to drop, reaching 2126 and 1334, respectively, in 2005. Over the decade, post-transplant graft and patient survival improved, as did the chances for survival while on the heart waiting list. The number of deceased donor lung transplants increased by 78% since 1996, reaching 1407 in 2005 (up 22% from 2004). There were 3170 registrants awaiting lung transplantation at the end of 2005, down 18% from 2004. Death rates for both candidates and recipients have been dropping, as has the time spent waiting for a lung transplant. Other lung topics covered are living donation, recent surgical advances and changes in immunosuppression regimens. Heart-lung transplantation has declined to a small (33 procedures in 2005) but important need in the United States.
