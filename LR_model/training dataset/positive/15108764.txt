End-stage renal failure and cardiac mortality after heart transplantation. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of mortality after the first year of heart transplantation. End-stage renal failure (ESRF) is more frequent because of long-term survival. Impact of ESRF on cardiac mortality in heart transplant patients is unappreciated. The hypothesis of accelerated CAD in uremic patients has been suggested. In Pitié La Salpêtrière hospital, 1211 heart transplants have been performed between 1982 and 2001. Thirty-three patients have reached ESRF. A case-control study was performed to identify risk factors responsible for ESRF and to appreciate the impact of ESRF on cardiac mortality. In cases at 6 months, serum creatinine tended to be higher (159 +/- 31 micromol/L vs. 141 +/- 44 micromol/L, p = 0.06) and cyclosporine (CSA) dosage (mg/kg) was significantly lower (5.4 +/- 1.8 mg/kg vs. 7.7 +/- 2.7 mg/ kg, p = 0.002). Mean triglyceride level after transplantation until dialysis was significantly lower in cases (2.18 +/- 0.82 mmol/L vs. 1.48 +/- 0.62 mmol/L, p = 0.002). In cases and controls, cardiac mortality was responsible for 67% (10 of 15) and 38% (three of eight) of all deaths, respectively. High triglyceride level (> or = 2 mmol/L) was associated with cardiac mortality [p < 0.03, hazard ratio (HR) = 3.89]. Kaplan Meier cardiac free survival rates were significantly lower in cases than in controls (p < 0.03). These data suggest that CSA nephrotoxicity could result from individually determined susceptibility and that hypertriglyceridemia may have a negative impact on renal function and cardiac mortality. The risk of cardiac mortality is increased in heart transplant patients with ESRF. The hypothesis of accelerated atherosclerosis in ESRF patients after heart transplantation leading to higher cardiac mortality incidence needs further study.
