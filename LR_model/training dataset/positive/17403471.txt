Effect of reversible pulmonary hypertension on outcomes after heart transplantation. Conflicting data exist regarding the impact of reversible pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) on post-transplant (Tx) outcomes. In this study we sought to determine the influence of reversible PHTN on outcomes after Tx. We retrospectively reviewed the records of adult patients who underwent heart Tx from 1993 to 2002. Patients were grouped depending on their measured pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Group 1 patients had a pre-Tx pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of < 3 Wood units (WU). Patients with reversible PHTN, defined as pre-Tx PVR > or = 3 WU and reversing to < 3 WU either with sub-lingual or intravenous vasodilatory agents, were divided into two groups based on their PVR before the reversibility test (PVR: Group 2, 3 to 4.5 WU; Group 3, > 4.5 WU). Records for 222 adult heart recipients were reviewed (Group 1, n = 171; Group 2, n = 35; Group 3, n = 16). Baseline clinical characteristics (age, gender, heart failure etiology, history of diabetes, ischemic time, donor age and gender) were similar in the three groups and the average follow-up was 58 months. One-month and 1-year mortality (Groups 1, 2 and 3: 2%, 0% and 13%; and 8%, 0% and 13%, respectively) did not differ significantly between groups. Actuarial mortality was assessed using Cox regression analysis, adjusted for age and gender, and no increased risk of death was demonstrated for patients with reversible PHTN (for Group 2: multivariate hazard ratio [HR] 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17 to 1.32, p = 0.15; for Group 3: HR 0.98, CI 0.34 to 2.84, p = 0.97). No differences were observed between the three groups for various post-Tx events, such as hospital stay, ICU stay, extubation time, transfusions, acute allograft dysfunction, acute hepatic dysfunction, acute and chronic renal dysfunction, infections, neurologic complications, gastrointestinal complications and coronary allograft vasculopathy. Reversible pulmonary hypertension is associated with similarly good post-transplant survival outcomes and morbidity, regardless of severity.
