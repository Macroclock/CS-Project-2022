Steroid pulse therapy combined with plasmapheresis for clinically compromised patients after heart transplantation. The most serious complication after heart transplantation is allograft dysfunction. Patients presenting with compromised hemodynamics show a high incidence of mortality. The most common reason for allograft dysfunction is rejection. We have employed steroid pulse therapy combined with plasmapheresis for hemodynamically compromised patients after heart transplantation. Steroid pulse therapy and plasmapheresis were performed on 35 patients who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation for graft dysfunction. Thus treatment rescued ventricular function and improved the ejection fraction in 77% of patients, among who ever 71.4% showed improved New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class. Steroid pulse therapy combined with plasmapheresis improved the cardiac contractility and NYHA functional class of most heart transplant recipients with graft dysfunction.
