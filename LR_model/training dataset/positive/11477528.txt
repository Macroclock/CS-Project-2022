Clinical significance of donor-unrecognized bacteremia in the outcome of solid-organ transplant recipients. We evaluated the clinical significance of unrecognized bacteremia in the organ donor (i.e., blood culture results that were reported to be positive after transplantation) on the outcome of transplant recipients. Twenty-nine of 569 liver and heart donors (5%) had bacteremia at the time of organ procurement, but there were no documented instances of transmission of the isolated bacteria from the donor to the recipient. Unrecognized bacteremia in the donor does not have a negative clinical impact on the outcome of organ transplant recipients.
