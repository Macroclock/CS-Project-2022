Cardiac arrest in the organ donor does not negatively influence recipient survival after heart transplantation. Cardiac arrest in the organ donor raises concerns about the possibility of ischemic cardiac damage. We evaluated the outcome of heart transplantation in patients receiving an organ from donors who had suffered a period of cardiac arrest. Demographics, operative details and outcome data were obtained retrospectively. Actuarial survival was reported using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared with the log rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model risk adjusted survival. Between 1 January 1991 and 1 November 2004 38 patients were transplanted with hearts from multiorgan donors who were resuscitated after a cardiac arrest. The mean (standard deviation) duration of cardiac arrest was 15 (8)min. The interval between donor cardiac arrest and organ excision was 69 (5)h. The 30-day mortality was 2.6% (1/38). In the same interim 566 patients underwent cardiac transplantation with hearts from organ donors without a cardiac arrest. Median time to follow up was 61 months (IQR 15-166). One and 5-year survival comparing the arrest and non-arrest groups was 94.2% versus 83.6% and 79.8% versus 74.5%, respectively, p=0.35. Donor cardiac arrest was not an adverse predictor of mortality on multivariate analysis, the adjusted odds ratio was 0.86 (95% CI 0.60-1.25, p=0.42). With careful case selection, there was no evidence that survival after cardiac transplantation was worse following a period of cardiac arrest in the organ donor. A history of cardiac arrest in the organ donor should not exclude an organ from being considered for transplantation.
