Results of heart transplantation: 16 years' experience in a center in Argentina. Heart transplantation (HTx) is the treatment of choice for advanced heart failure refractory to other treatments. To report the outcomes of patients undergoing orthotopic HTx in a center with 16 years' experience. We retrospectively examined the outcomes from three hundred nine HTx recipients between February 1993 and March 2009. The mean recipient age was 46 +/- 16 years, and 80% were male. Ischemic cardiomyopathy was present in 37%; 43% (n = 133) were elective procedures and 57% (n = 176) were urgent/emergency procedures. The mean donor age was 26 years; their main cause of death was head/brain trauma. Survival was studied using Kaplan-Meier curves. The global survival rates at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years were 80%, 74%, 71%, and 65%, respectively. Excluding losses during the first year after transplantation (conditional survival), the survival rate at 5 and 10 years reached 92% and 88.5%, respectively. The median follow-up was 7.7 years. The etiology and the urgent/emergency nature of the procedures did not show significant differences regarding the mortality rate (P = .8). The main causes of death were sepsis (28%) and primary nonfunction (18%). In-hospital mortality reached 16%. No significant differences were observed between the urgent/emergency versus the elective transplant procedures (P = .06). During the follow-up, the incidence of severe acute cellular rejection episodes was <3% after 5 years. The global incidence of antibody-mediated rejection reached 4.5%. Eleven subjects (3.5%) were diagnosed with post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder. During long-term follow-up, the incidences of kidney failure, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipemia were 21%, 24%, 69%, and 70%, respectively. One percent required chronic dialysis. In our center, post-HTx survival rates at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years were 80%, 74%, 71%, and 65%, respectively, which were similar to those reported by the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT).
