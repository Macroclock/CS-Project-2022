Long-term outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention of left main coronary artery for treatment of cardiac allograft vasculopathy after orthotopic heart transplantation. The present study evaluated the safety and efficacy of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the unprotected left main coronary artery (ULMCA) for the treatment of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) in consecutive unselected patients with orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). PCI in patients with OHT and develop CAV has been associated with greater restenosis rates compared to PCI in patients with native coronary artery disease. A paucity of short- and long-term data is available from patients with OHT who have undergone PCI for ULMCA disease. The present retrospective, multicenter, international registry included 21 patients with OHT and CAV who underwent ULMCA PCI from 1997 to 2009. Angiographic success was achieved in all patients. Drug-eluting stents were used in 14 of the 21 patients. No major adverse cardiac events or repeat OHT occurred within the first 30 days. At a mean follow-up of 4.9 Â± 3.2 years, 3 patients (14%) had died, myocardial infarction had occurred in 1 patient (5%), and target lesion revascularization had been required in 4 patients (19%). Follow-up angiography was performed in 16 patients (76%), and restenosis was observed in 4 (19%). No stent thrombosis of the ULMCA was observed. One patient (5%) underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, and 5 patients (24%) underwent repeat OHT. In conclusion, the results of our study have shown ULMCA PCI to be safe and reasonably effective in patients with OHT and represents a viable treatment strategy for CAV in these patients.
