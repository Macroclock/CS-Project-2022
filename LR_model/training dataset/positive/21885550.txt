A high-volume heart transplantation center in an Islamic country. Cardiac transplants are performed sporadically or not at all in the majority of predominantly Muslim countries in the Middle East. We examined our experience in 76 patients who underwent heart transplantation between January 2005 and May 2010 in our center in Saudi Arabia. Excluded were 50 transplants performed between 1989 and 2004, due to incomplete data. Primary outcomes were complications, 30-day and late mortality rates, and 1-year survival. The heart transplant activity between 2005 and 2010 (15.0 per year) was 4.5-fold higher than that between 1989 and 2004 (3.3 per year). There were 61 (80%) men and 15 (20%) women, with a mean age of 35 years (range, 13-57 years). The mean waiting list time was 64 days (range, 1-262 days), and hospital stay was 30 days (range, 12-166 days). Major complications were infection (10), low-grade rejection (9), reoperation for hemorrhage (8), and sternal dehiscence (2). The 30-day mortality was 7.8% (6/76). Actuarial survival was 87.4% at 1 year and 81.5% at 3 years. A hospital in a Muslim country can increase cardiac transplant activity with excellent 30-day mortality and early survival comparable to that in worldwide counterparts.
