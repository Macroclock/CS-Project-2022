Influence of UNOS status on chance of heart transplantation and posttransplant survival. This study was designed to compare the chance of heart transplantation (HTx) and survival among patients in different UNOS statuses in Taiwan. From 1996 to 2002, among 203 patients on the heart transplant waiting list, 127 patients had undergone HTx up to December 2002 with 71 dead while waiting, and 5 still alive without transplantation. This study included those 198 patients who had either undergone HTx or who died. At the time of registry, 40 patients were at status IA, 57 at IB, and 101 at II. Nineteen (47.5%) of 40 status IA patients underwent HTx with a mean waiting time of 92 +/- 116 days and median waiting time of 35 days. The 1-month survival was 84%, and 1-year survival was 58%. Seven (64.9%) of 57 status IB patients underwent HTx with a mean waiting time of 85 +/- 100 days and a median waiting time of 40 days. Both 1-month and 1-year survivals were 92%. Seventy-one (70.3%) patients among 101 status II patients underwent HTx. Their mean waiting time was 134 +/- 135 days and median waiting time was 86 days. Their 1-month survival was 95%, and 1-year survival was 85%. Although UNOS status IA patients had a shorter waiting time, their chance to undergo HTx was lower than those in either status IB or status II. The UNOS status IA heart-waiting patients showed lower posttransplant 1-month and 1-year survival rates.
