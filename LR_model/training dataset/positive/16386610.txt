Influence of HLA matching on survival in heart transplantation. In renal transplantation, the degree of HLA matching has been reported to be negatively correlated with graft loss, with the number of rejections with complications. This association is less clear in heart transplantation, where there are contradictory studies, although most are consistent with those in renal transplantation. The objective of this study was to analyze differences in the probability of survival and the incidence of complications during follow-up according to the degree of HLA-A, -B, and -DR matching. Two hundred forty-three consecutive patients transplanted over a 13-year period were analyzed for age, gender, pretransplant factors associated with mortality, number of rejections and infections, incidence of acute graft failure, arterial hypertension, diabetes, and survival time with cause of death with reference to the number of HLA matches (zero to six). Exclusion criteria included retransplants, heart-lung transplants, pediatric transplants, and perioperative mortality. Groups were compared using the chi(2) and ANOVA (Bonferroni posthoc test) tests. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared using the log rank test. The significance level was set at P < .05. The overall probability of survival of our series at 1, 5, and 10 years was 85%, 77%, and 60%, respectively. HLA-A, -B, and -DR compatibility: No significant differences were found when the curves were compared (log-rank: .005). The best survival rates were obtained with lower degrees of matching. No significant differences were found in the number of rejections or infections, although survival rates (P = .007) were higher among those with the lower degrees of matching. A higher degree of HLA-A, -B, and -DR matching did not have a positive effect on heart transplant patient survival, rejection episodes or infections.
