Extracoporeal membrane oxygenation to rescue cardiopulmonary failure after heart transplantation: a single-center experience. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can provide excellent mechanical circulatory support (MCS). Some case reports use ECMO to rescue heart transplantation (HTx) recipients with posttransplant cardiopulmonary failure. Herein reported a series of use of ECMO to rescue HTx recipients with refractory cardiopulmonary failure have during the posttransplant period. The causes of cardiopulmonary failure were right ventricular failure, primary graft failure, acute rejection, or sepsis. A retrospective review of 366 consecutive HTx recipients revealed 40 cases of cardiopulmonary failure requiring ECMO rescue in the posttransplant period. There were 14 patients diagnosed as right ventricular cardiopulmonary failure; 7 primary graft failure with a stunned donors myocardium, 8 as acute cellular or humoral rejection, and 11 as sepsis with positive blood cultures. ECMO-related variables were evaluated for association with mortality. The HTx recipients included 35 males and 5 females with overall median age of 42.3 years (range, 0.48-65.22). The weaning rate was 72.5% (29/40) and survival, 52.5% (21/40). ECMO provided temporary MCS rescuing some HTx recipients with posttransplant cardiopulmonary failure. None of the patients receiving ECMO support for >4 days survived.
