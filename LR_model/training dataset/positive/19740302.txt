Long-term results of heart transplantation for end-stage valvular heart disease. In general, heart transplantation for patients with heart failure improves survival. However, the outcomes of heart transplantation for patients with end-stage valvular heart disease are less well reported. This is a substantial group of patients, many of whom have had previous cardiac surgery. They therefore may be considered a subgroup with a poor prognosis. This study reports on the outcomes of heart transplantation for patients with end-stage valvular heart disease. From March 1989 to December 2004, 75 consecutive adult heart transplantations were performed for end-stage valvular heart disease. Clinical characteristics were retrieved from a computerized database. The early mortality risk in heart transplantation for end-stage valvular heart disease was 13%, compared to 8% for other indications (p = 0.12). The main causes of early death were rejection (20%) and right ventricular failure (20%). The total follow-up time was 415 patient-years. During the follow-up, another 23 patients died (55/1000 patient-years of late mortality rate), mostly due to infection (43%) and multiorgan failure (22%). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that increased waiting time to heart transplantation correlated with increased survival (HR = 0.998, p = 0.04). The survival at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years was 70%, 64%, 56%, and 46% compared to 78%, 68%, 53%, and 41% for other indications, respectively (p = 0.5). The outcomes of heart transplantation for patients with end-stage valvular heart disease are similar to those for other patients. Apparently, the longer the waiting time to heart transplantation the better the outcome becomes.
