Impact of donor high-risk social behaviors on recipient survival in cardiac transplantation. To investigate the impact of cardiac donor participation in high-risk social behaviors (HRSBs) on recipient survival. Retrospective chart review queried cardiac transplantations performed at our institution from August 1994 to November 2007 involving donors known to have engaged in HRSBs. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to analyze survival rates, and a Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to determine the impact of donor HRSBs on survival. We identified 143 donors with social histories containing the following HRSBs: incarceration (n=69), unprofessional tattoos or piercings (n=44), alternative lifestyle practice (n=11), cocaine use (n=60), heroin smoking (n=6), marijuana use (n=79), oral narcotic abuse (n=20), and intravenous drug use (n=21). At the time of donation, viral screens detected 10 donors who were hepatitis B virus (HBV) positive, 11 donors who were hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive, and no donors who were positive for the HIV. One-year and 5-year survival were 92.2% and 84.4%, respectively. Cox regression analysis found only donor HCV infection to be associated with poorer recipient survival (P=0.14). Using cardiac allografts from high-risk donors who are serologically negative for viruses does not seem to impact recipient survival. There is a considerable risk for transmission of HBV and HCV when these are detected by pretransplant screens. However, if pretransplant screening does not discover donor HBV, HCV, or HIV infection, it is unlikely that subclinical disease transmission will occur.
