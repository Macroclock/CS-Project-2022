Diabetes as an outcome predictor after heart transplantation. We aimed to compare post-transplantation morbidity and survival among heart transplant recipients with and without diabetes mellitus. A retrospective review of 141 adult patients submitted to heart transplantation from November 2003 to June 2009 (with a minimum follow-up of one year) was undertaken. The patients were divided into two groups: those with (29%) and those without (71%) pre-transplantation diabetes. Those with diabetes were older (57.6 ± 6.1 vs. 52.3 ± 11.1 years; P=0.020) and had lower creatinine clearance (53.6 ± 15.1 vs. 63.7 ± 22.1; P=0.029). Nine patients died in hospital (6.4%; P=non-significant). No significant differences in lipid profiles (diabetes vs. no diabetes) existed before transplantation or at one year afterwards. Patients with diabetes showed a significant deterioration in their one-year lipid profile (158 ± 43 vs.192 ± 38 mg/dl; P=0.001), although one-year fasting diabetic was lower than before (178 ± 80 vs. 138 ± 45 mg/dl; P=0.016). During the first year, 17 (17%) patients previously free of diabetes developed new-onset diabetes. No significant differences were seen in rejection at one year (14% vs. 20%), infection (31% vs. 33%), new-onset renal dysfunction (8% vs. 14%) or mortality (17% vs. 7%). One-year survival was not significantly different (83% vs. 94%), but there was a significant decrease in the survival of individuals with diabetes at three years (73% vs. 91%; P=0.020). No significant difference was found in one-year survival or in terms of higher morbidity in the heart transplant patients with diabetes, but a longer follow-up showed a significant decrease in survival. Nonetheless, the patients with diabetes benefited significantly from transplantation and should not be excluded from it.
