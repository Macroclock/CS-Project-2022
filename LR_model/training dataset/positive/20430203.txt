Outcome in children bridged and nonbridged to cardiac transplantation. Heart transplantation (HTx) in children with end-stage heart disease has become an accepted treatment option. To evaluate our results of pediatric cardiac transplantation with vs without bridge methods. The study included 31 patients (34 transplantations) younger than 18 years who underwent orthotopic HTx between March 1995 and December 2008. Ten patients were girls, and 21 were boys. Preoperative diagnoses included cardiomyopathy (n=20), congenital heart disease (n=7), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n=2), restrictive cardiomyopathy (n=1), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (n=1). Mean (SD) ischemia time was 185 (72) minutes. Thirty-day mortality was 6%, and was due to primary graft failure (n=2). Overall follow-up was 4.36 (3.93) years. Eleven patients underwent bridge techniques before HTx, and 11 patients required perioperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ventricular assist device support. In the group that received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 8 patients (73%) were successfully weaned and discharged with excellent functional class. There were no differences in operative mortality, functional class, survival, rejection, and infection rates between the bridged and nonbridged groups. Overall actuarial 1- and 5-year survival rates were 93% and 83%, respectively. All survivors had good functional class. Our findings demonstrate satisfactory medium-term outcome of HTx in selected pediatric patients with end-stage heart disease. Using bridge methods in children at high risk can increase the opportunity to receive a donor heart. These bridge methods achieve similar postoperative outcomes.
