Use of hearts transplanted from donors with atraumatic intracranial bleeds. Donor atraumatic intracranial bleed (aICB) is associated with older age and may reflect a history of hypertension. Hearts from donors who died of aICB may be at increased risk for graft failure because of the associated catecholamine surge. We evaluated whether receiving a heart from a donor who had an aICB independently affected the outcome of transplantation. We reviewed adult patients (>18 years) who underwent heart transplantation between July 1994 and December 1999. We excluded patients who received non-standard hearts (e.g., donor age >55 years). Group 1 received hearts from donors with aICB (n = 80), and Group 2 received hearts from donors who did not have aICB (n = 171). Recipient age, gender, United Network for Organ Sharing status, and indication for transplantation were similar for both groups. Donors in Group 1 were older (41 vs 26 years, p = 0.001), more commonly women (55% vs 20%, p = 0.001), and more often had history of hypertension (26% vs 2%, p = 0.001). Survival to discharge was 86% in Group 1 and 95% in Group 2. Actuarial 5-year survival was 72% for Group 1 and 81% for Group 2 (p = 0.52). Regression analysis showed that receiving a heart from a donor with aICB was a risk factor for early recipient mortality but not for long-term outcome (odds ratio = 3.25, p = 0.02, and hazard ratio = 1.16, p = 0.69, respectively). Donor aICB, female gender, and abnormal initial echocardiogram (global hypokinesia) were selected as clinically relevant independent risk factors for early mortality of the recipient, using a fitted multifactor logistic regression model (goodness-of-fit chi-square p value = 0.94). Donor age, accident-to-retrieval time interval, and borderline left ventricular hypertrophy did not significantly differ. Five-year freedom from transplant coronary artery disease in Group 1 was 74% (vs 80% in Group 2, p = 0.05). The trend observed in this series suggests that receiving a heart from a donor with aICB is a potential independent risk factor for early mortality after transplantation independent of age. Caution should be used when evaluating such donors, particularly when other risk factors such as female donor or depressed ejection fraction are present.
