Tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene polymorphism and death due to acute cellular rejection in a subgroup of heart transplant recipients. Irreversible acute rejection of the transplanted heart usually has a fatal outcome. Predicting which recipients are most likely to reject might allow closer monitoring and modification of treatment protocols to prevent graft loss. Recipients genetically predisposed to produce more TNF-alpha are those who suffer the most acute rejection episodes. Here we show that TNF-alpha genotype is strongly associated with death due to acute cell-mediated heart transplant rejection (Chi-square = 28.57, p < 0.0001). This subgroup of recipients should be given optimally tissue matched transplants and should be treated with the most effective immunosuppressive regimens.
