Heart transplantation 1987--2007: 20 years' experience at Chulalongkorn hospital. After many years, heart transplantation is still the most accepted treatment for end-stage heart disease. A heart transplantation program was started at our hospital in December 1987 as the first intrathoracic organ transplantation in Southeast Asia. Herein, we have reviewed our 20 years of experience from 1987 to 2007. We followed every individual within our 52-patient cohort for up to 20 years. Three eras were studied: 1987 to 1995, 1996 to 2002, and 2003 to 2007. End points were survival, rejection, infection event, and graft coronary artery disease (CAD). There were 52 patients (39 males and 12 females). The mean age was 41.7 years (range, 12-23 years). Perioperative mortality (within 1 month) was 13.4% (n = 7) due to graft failure (n = 2), rejection (n = 3), infection (n = 1), on pulmonary hypertension (n = 1). Medium-term mortality (1-12 months) was 30.7% (n = 16) due to rejection (n = 8), infection (n = 7), or CAD (n = 1). After 1 year causes of death were rejection (n = 4), infection (n = 4), renal failure (n = 2), or CAD (n = 1). Overall actuarial 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates for all recipients were 54.7%, 43.3%, and 32.5%, respectively. The first patient in this series is still alive. For the period 2003 to 2007, actuarial 1-year and 4-year survival rates for all recipients were both 77.8%. The rate of rejection was reduced to just one event during this period. All surviving patients were NYHA Functional class I and II; 86% went back to work, leading almost normal lives. Improved survival in the current era may be attributed to better organ preservation, improved immunosuppression, and control of infection, as well as less graft CAD. Those who survive more than 1 year have a good quality of life.
