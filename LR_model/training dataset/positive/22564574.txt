Ventricular assist device application as a bridge to pediatric heart transplantation: a single center's experience. There are limited options for mechanical circulatory support to treat end-stage heart failure in pediatric patients. Although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is commonly used in infants and children, ventricular assist devices (VAD) provide a longer duration of support with fewer complications before recovery or as a bridge to heart transplantation (HTx), as described herein. This retrospective chart review of eight patients transplanted from April 2008 to December 2011, after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation due to end-stage heart failure. Their mean age was 12 years (9-15 y) and mean body weight, 48 kg (20-78). All were New York Heart Association functional class IV with mean left ventricular ejection fractions less than 15%. The six patients (75%) received HTx after a mean LVAD support duration of 43.2 days; 2 (25%) died before a suitable heart became available. Their mean duration of LVAD support was 30 days. There were 4 (50%) who experienced clinically evident thromboembolic events: 3 (37.5%) cerebrovascular with 1 mortality and 1 (12.5%) as acute limb ischemia. Transient hemodialysis was performed in 4 (50%). Bloodstream infection identified in 6 (75%) was controlled with intravenous antibiotics. Driveline infection identified in 4 (50%) was treated successfully with local wound dressing changes and intravenous antibiotics. One 9-year-old boy died of rejection at 16 months after transplantation. Because of the organ shortage, pediatric patients have a low chance to undergo HTx. VAD provides long-term support for children with end-stage heart failure before a suitable heart becomes available. A thromboembolic event remains a major complication influencing their survival.
