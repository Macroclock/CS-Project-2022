Experience with cyclosporine: from revolution to evolution of immunosuppressive protocols in thoracic organ transplantation. The introduction of cyclosporine into clinical practice of thoracic organ transplantation had a dramatic and positive effect on both short- and long-term survival. Today, the majority of patients are still treated with this drug, and different immunosuppressive combination therapies have further resulted in improved long-term survival. Such combinations to calcineurin inhibitors include prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and Rapamycin. Based on data from our own institution 1- and 5-year survival rates of 86% and 78% can be obtained after heart transplantation and 76% and 59% after lung transplantation. Causes of death are described. Future immunosuppressive strategies will have to concentrate further on the omission of organ-damaging side effects. Also, not a single compound or combination for immunosuppression after thoracic organ transplantation has proved to be effective in cases with chronic rejection (eg, transplant vasculopathy in heart transplantation and bronchiolitis obliterans in lung transplantation). Moreover, with current survival data in mind, quality of life has to be considered a major focus for future designs of immunosuppressive protocols.
