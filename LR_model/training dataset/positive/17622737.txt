Risk stratification for renal transplantation after cardiac or lung transplantation: single-center experience and review of the literature. Long-term survival after heart (HTx) or lung (LuTx) transplantation increases the risk for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). After HTx ESRD was reported to enhance mortality, and kidney transplantation (KTx) was shown to improve survival. However, prognostic factors in ESRD after HTx or LuTx are largely unknown. Single-center observational study in HTx and LuTx patients who accessed the KTx waiting list; baseline characteristics were correlated with mortality. KTx was performed in 15 of 65 study patients. Survival was comparable on the KTx waiting list and in reference patients from the same center without ESRD. KTx significantly improved survival (5 years' survival 84.6% with KTx vs. 56.5% on the KTx waiting list, p = 0.030). None of the baseline parameters predicted mortality in the KTx group. Only on the KTx waiting list BMI (median 24.7 vs. 20.7; p < 0.05) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, median 63 vs. 53%, p < 0.008) significantly correlated with survival. The risk for mortality after HTx or LuTx is not increased by ESRD, provided that patients meet access criteria for the KTx waiting list. KTx improves survival in ESRD after HTx or LuTx. BMI and LVEF may predict outcome in HTx/LuTx patients on the KTx waiting list.
