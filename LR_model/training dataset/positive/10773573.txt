Heterotopic heart transplantation: experimental development and clinical experience. Heterotopic heart transplantation was initially developed in the laboratory for experimental transplantation. While it was more widely utilized in the pre-cyclosporine era to provide adjunct circulatory support in combination with the native heart, associated complications as well as improved long-term graft survival have now established orthotopic transplantation as the procedure of choice. Heterotopic heart transplantation is currently reserved for highly selected patients. The technique is only performed at selected transplantation centers, and indications include significant donor recipient size mismatch or irreversible recipient pulmonary hypertension. The foreseeable introduction of clinical porcine xenotransplantation may lead to renewed interest in the technique of heterotopic heart transplantation as a bridge to potential native heart recovery or allotransplantation in selected patients.
