Management of the sensitized cardiac recipient: the use of plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin. Previously, we reported that the combination of plasmapheresis (PP) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) allow sensitized patients to undergo orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT), even across a positive crossmatch. In the current study, the effect of that combination, PP+IVIg, on survival of a larger group of such recipients is investigated. The latter group (I) consisted of 35 sensitized patients who received PP+IVIG together with standard immunosuppressive drugs. Rejection was seen in 11 patients, findings strongly suggestive of a vascular (humoral) being identified in five of those cases. Four deaths occurred, two of them in the immediate post-operative period, one after almost six months, and one after almost two yr post-OHT. Follow-up range 4.5 months to 7.8 yr post-OHT (average=1.1 yr). Patient survival was analyzed after generation of a Kaplan-Meier plot. Comparison with a control OHT group (II) given standard immunosuppressive drugs only (N=276) showed enhanced survival of group I (p=0.0414 by log-rank test). We conclude that the combination of PP and IVIG (i) is associated with declines in T- and B-percent-reactive antibody and in crossmatch positivity, and (ii) is very useful in the management of the sensitized cardiac patient undergoing OHT, often allowing a successful outcome to transplantation in the face of a positive crossmatch.
