Impact of smoking on survival after heart transplantation. Smoking is an important risk factor in any population group. According to previous studies, having been a smoker before heart transplantation (HT) confers a greater likelihood of developing any type of tumor or other complication after HT. Our objective was to determine the impact of having been a smoker before HT on survival, respiratory complications during the postoperative period, and long-term tumor development. After excluding combined transplantations, pediatric transplantations, and retransplantations, we retrospectively reviewed 288 HT performed between November 1987 and September 2006. We divided patients into nonsmokers (including those who quit smoking more than 1 year before HT (n = 163), exsmokers for less than 1 year (n = 76), and those who smoked until HT (n = 49). The statistical tests were chi-square, Student t, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Kaplan-Meier curves. There were more male patients among smokers and exsmokers than nonsmokers (93.9% vs 96.1% vs 82%, respectively; P = .003). There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the groups. Exsmokers remained intubated for a longer time than smokers or nonsmokers (33.4 +/- 44.6 vs 14.2 +/- 7.3 vs 17.9 +/- 19.2, respectively; P = .05). We observed the same trend in recovery unit stay (7.9 +/- 10.5 days vs 4.4 +/- 1.88 days vs 4.84 +/- 3.49 days, respectively; P = .021). The development of any type of tumor was also more frequent among smokers and exsmokers, although not significantly. The survival rate was similar in nonsmokers and exsmokers, although higher than in smokers (89.57 vs 92.11% vs 81.63%, respectively; P = .031). We did not observe differences in the causes of death. Patients who smoke or have smoked until shortly before HT showed a poorer prognosis and a longer recovery unit stay. There was also a trend to increased tumor development.
