Long-term results of pediatric heart transplantation. We retrospectively reviewed 104 consecutive patients who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation between November 1989 and February 2004. From November 1989 to February 2004, the total number of heart transplantations were 1,340 cases at our institute. One hundred four (7.8%) of these 1,340 patients were pediatrics. Average age was 6.2 years, ranging from 4 months to 16 years. The cause of heart disease before transplantation was: idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in 74 patients (71%), and congenital heart disease (CHD) in 30 (29%). Hospital mortality rate was 14.4% (15 patients). Late complications were rejection in 23 (22.1%), infection in 11 (10.6%), gingival hyperplasia in 28 (26.9%), hypertention in 22 (21.1%), coronary artery disease (CAD) in 12 (12.5%), graft failure in 11(10.5%), and malignancy in 2 (1.9%). Late mortality occurred in 11 (10.6%) patients. Causes of death were sudden death in 2 (1.9%), CAD in 3 (2.8%), graft failure in 1 (1.0%), acute rejection in 4 (4.6%), and infection in 1 (1.0%). Actuarial survival rates in pediatrics at 1, 5, 10 years were 82%, 80%, and 78%, respectively. On the other hand, actuarial survival rates in adults at 1, 5, 10 years were 78%, 75%, 59%, respectively. Heart transplantation for pediatrics is an effective therapy with acceptable morbidity and mortality. The long-term survival results in pediatrics are comparable to those of adult heart transplantations. However, the actuarial survival rate in pediatrics after 10 years is significantly better than in adults' cases. Renal function in pediatric heart transplantation recipients treated with cyclosporine remains stable during long-term follow-up.
