Study of the renal function in nonrenal organ transplantation. Kidney disease after transplantation of a nonrenal organ has been described to be the result of the nephrotoxicity from the commonly used calcineurin-inhibitors as well as other factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate renal function and potential risk factors for the development of chronic renal failure among nonrenal organ recipients. We designed a single-center retrospective study including all 165 of our cardiac and liver recipients between February 1998 and October 2003, collecting clinical, analytic, and therapeutic data. We excluded double transplants and patients with survival less than 6 months. Creatinine clearance was calculated according to the Cockcroft-Gault and the Levey Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)-5 equations. Although 165 patients received a cardiac or liver transplantation, 17 died in the first 6 months and three were double transplants; therefore we analyzed 145 patients: 107 (74%) cardiac transplantations and 38 (26%) liver transplantations. There were 106 male and 39 female recipients. The mean age (+/-SD) at the time of transplantation was 54 +/- 10 years and the mean follow-up was 2.9 +/- 1.7 years. Urinalysis before transplantation was only performed in 33 patients (22.8%) including three (2.1%) who had proteinuria. Serum creatinine increased until 12 months after transplantation (P < .001), then it recovered its average level. Creatinine clearance calculated using the aforementioned equations showed a similar pattern, with a progressive decline to 12 months (P < .05), with eventual stabilization or even improvement. The factors that we observed to increase the risk of renal damage were age, female sex, obesity, and the presence of proteinuria prior to transplantation. There was a good correlation (r = 0.96) between cyclosporine but not tacrolimus trough levels and serum creatinine at 48 hours after transplantation.
