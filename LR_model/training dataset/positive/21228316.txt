Improved survival in heart transplant recipients in the United States: racial differences in era effect. Posttransplant survival in heart transplant recipients has progressively improved during the past 2 decades. It is unknown, however, whether the major racial groups in the United States have benefited equally. We analyzed all primary heart transplant recipients aged â‰¥18 years in the United States from 1987 to 2008. We compared posttransplant survival in white, black, and Hispanic recipients in 5 successive eras (1987 to 1992, 1993 to 1996, 1997 to 2000, 2001 to 2004, 2005 to 2008). Early survival was defined as freedom from death or retransplantation during the first 6 months posttransplant. Longer-term, conditional survival was assessed in patients who survived the first 6 months. There were 29 986 (81.6%) white, 4745 (12.9%) black, and 2017 (5.5%) Hispanic patients in the study cohort. Black patients were at increased risk of early death or retransplant (hazard ratio [HR], 1.15; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.26) in adjusted analysis. Early posttransplant survival improved (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.87 for successive eras) equally in all 3 groups (black-era interaction, P=0.94; Hispanic-era interaction, P=0.40). Longer-term survival improved in white (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.97 for successive eras) but not in black (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.09) or Hispanic (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.09) recipients, resulting in increased disparities in longer-term survival with time. Early posttransplant survival has improved equally in white, black, and Hispanic heart transplant recipients. Longer-term survival has improved in white but not in black or Hispanic recipients, resulting in a more marked disparity in outcomes in the current era. These disparities warrant further investigation and targeted interventions.
