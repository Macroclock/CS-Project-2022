Is severe right ventricular failure in left ventricular assist device recipients a risk factor for unsuccessful bridging to transplant and post-transplant mortality. Bridging to transplant with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) can be limited by severe right ventricular failure (RVF). The focus of this study was to ascertain whether early implantation (< 24 hours) of a right ventricular assist device (RVAD) in patients with severe RVF improved survival and whether severe RVF adversely affected post-transplant survival. We conducted a 10-year review of our bridge to transplant experience using the Heartmate device (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA, USA), studying patients who required an Abiomed RVAD (Abiomed, Danvers, MA, USA). There were 243 patients who underwent LVAD implantation, of which 17 (7.0%) required an RVAD. Ten patients underwent early RVAD insertion (< 24 hours) while 7 underwent delayed insertion (> 24 hours). Bridging to transplant was successful in 11 (64.7%) RVAD patients versus 163 (72.1%) non-RVAD patients (p = 0.046). Of the 10 patients who underwent early RVAD insertion, 7 (70.0%) were successfully bridged. Of the 7 patients who underwent delayed RVAD insertion, 4 (57.1%) were successfully bridged (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in post-transplant 1, 5, and 10-year survival between RVAD and non-RVAD patients (71.4%, 71.4%, and 71.4% for RVAD patients, vs 90.5%, 80.4%, and 78.5%, respectively, for non-RVAD patients; p = 0.366). Pretransplant RVAD support was not a risk factor for post-transplant mortality (p = 0.864). Severe RVF adversely impacted bridging to transplant, although survival was improved with early RVAD insertion. The trend toward worse post-transplant survival in the RVAD cohort raises the possibility that if additional patients were evaluated, a difference in survival might be observed, suggesting the need for a multicenter analysis.
