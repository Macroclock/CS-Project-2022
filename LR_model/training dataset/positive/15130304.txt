[Orthotopic heart transplantation: a clinical analysis of 43 patients]. To explore the experience of orthotopic heart transplantation. Between August 1995 and May 2003, 43 patients with end-stage heart disease, 40 males and 3 females, aged 13 approximately 58, the underlying diseases being of dilated cardiomyopathy (39 cases), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (3 cases), and coronary cardiopathy (1 case), underwent orthotopic heart transplantation in Union Hospital, Fujian Medical University. The surgical results and relevant influencing factors were studied retrospectively. Seven cases died of complication within one month postoperationally, among which 5 died of acute right heart failure, 1 of septicemia, and 1 of acute renal failure, with a mortality of 16.3%. 5 cases died much later, among which 2 died of acute rejection, 2 of infection, and 1 of arrhythmia. The long-term survivors had a rather good quality of life. Heart transplantation is an effective treatment for patients with end-stage heart diseases. Appropriate selection of recipients with low pulmonary vascular resistance and proper immunosuppression treatment are key measures of successful heart transplantation.
