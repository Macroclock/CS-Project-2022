New prioritization of heart transplant candidates on mechanical circulatory support in an era of severe donor shortage. Nearly all patients receiving heart transplantation (HTx) in Germany are now those listed in urgent status. In this study we review urgency-based allocation policy for HTx candidates with ventricular assist devices (VADs). We retrospectively studied 345 adult candidates for de novo HTx. Group U (n = 160) comprised patients primarily listed in urgent status without VAD. Group VAD-45 (n = 167) comprised patients with intended bridging to HTx who survived >45 days after VAD implantation (after initial drop in survival rates). Among these patients, those who died of stroke or were awarded urgent status due to difficulties of coagulation management (thrombus formation, thromboembolism and bleeding) in the first year after VAD implantation were assigned to Group COAG (n = 36), and those who died or were awarded urgent status due to device-related infection in the same period were assigned to Group INF (n = 31). Actuarial survival rates were studied in each group. Survival rates during support in Group VAD-45 were comparable to those during urgent status in Group U. Bridge-to-transplant rate was 63.9% in Group COAG and 58.1% in Group INF. The post-transplant 3-year survival rate of 85.3% in Group COAG was significantly higher than that in Group INF (46.8%, p < 0.01) and Group U (62.4%, p < 0.05). Patients who have a VAD for >45 days should be awarded some priority for urgent HTx, which is currently prohibited in Germany. Patients listed in urgent status due to difficulties of coagulation management should be prioritized over those listed for device-related infection to make effective use of limited resources.
