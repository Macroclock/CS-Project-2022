Heart transplantation in neonates and children. Intermediate-term results. To assess intermediate-term outcome in children who have undergone orthotopic heart transplantation. We carried out a longitudinal and prospective study between October '92 and June '99 comprising 20 patients with ages ranging from 12 days to 7 years (mean of 2.8 years). We employed a double immunosuppression protocol with cyclosporine and azathioprine and induction therapy with polyclonal antithymocyte serum. Survival and complications resulting from the immunosuppression protocol were analyzed. The double immunosuppression protocol and the induction therapy with polyclonal antithymocyte serum resulted in an actuarial survival curve of 90% and 78.2% at 1 and 6 years, respectively, with a mean follow-up period of 3.6 years. One patient died due to acute rejection 40 days after transplantation; another patient died 2 years after transplantation due to lymphoproliferative disorder; a third patient died because of primary failure of the graft; and a fourth patient died due to bronchopneumonia. The major complications were as follows: acute rejection, infection, nephrotoxicity, and systemic hypertension. The means of rejection and infection episodes per patient were 2.9 and 3.4, respectively. After one year of transplantation, a slight reduction in the creatinine clearance and systemic hypertension were observed in 7 (38.9%) patients. Heart transplantation made life possible for those patients with complex congenital heart diseases and cardiomyopathies in refractory congestive heart failure constituting a therapeutical option for this group of patients in the terminal phase.
