Cadaveric lobar lung transplantation: technical aspects. The use of lobar transplantation and other size reduction techniques has allowed larger donor lungs to be utilized for smaller recipients who tend to have longer waiting times for transplantation. However, despite these advantages, the techniques have not been widely adopted. We outline the surgical and sizing issues associated with this technique. A retrospective review of 23 consecutive patients who received lung transplantation with anatomic lobar reduction was performed, focusing on surgical technique and outcomes. All 23 patients received an anatomic lobar reduction of between 1 and 3 lobes. Survival analysis showed no difference between the lobar reduction cohort and the other historically comparable lung transplant patients from our institution (p=0.115). Percent predicted forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 second at 3 months correlated with transplanted donor to recipient total lung capacity ratio, confirming the importance of correct sizing. Anatomic lobar reduction in lung transplantation is a safe and effective means of transplanting pediatric and small adult recipients, and urgently listed patients.
