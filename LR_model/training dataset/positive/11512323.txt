Sixteen-year experience with 1,000 heart transplants at UCLA. 1. The consecutive pre- and post-1994 eras have demonstrated improved survival for all age groups. This is linked to improved preservation methods, surgical technique and immunosuppression agents. 2. The use of marginal donor hearts for Status I and alternate elderly patients has followed the model of matching donor and recipient risk without affecting patient outcome and minimized the use of implantable assist devices. 3. A donor history of systemic gram-negative infection, hypertension, or traumatic intracranial bleeds was an important marker for risk. Younger age and shorter ischemia time could compensate for other hazards. 4. Heart transplantation in carefully selected elderly recipients yielded clinical results similar to those of younger patients with less rejection. 5. An adult alternate recipient list proved useful to prevent diversion of standard donors away from younger recipients. 6. Retransplantation for TCAD is acceptable but much less satisfactory for acute graft failure. 7. Trends show an increase in the use of implantable devices; refinement in technology for mechanical assist and replacement is forthcoming.
