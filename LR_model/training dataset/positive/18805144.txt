Long-term outcome of lung and heart-lung transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. The survival after lung and heart-lung transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension has been reportedly the lowest among the major diagnostic categories of lung transplant recipients. Retrospective analysis was performed for lung and heart-lung transplant recipients for idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension from 1982 to 2006. The patients were divided into 2 groups, based on the era; group 1: 1982 to 1993, and group 2: 1994 to 2006. Since 1994, we have introduced our current protocols including prostaglandin E1 and nitroglycerin for donor lung preservation, and lung protection with cold and terminal warm blood pneumoplegia as well as immunosuppression with alemtuzumab induction. These modifications were introduced in different years over a wide span of time (1994 to 2003). Group 1 had 59 patients (35 +/- 1 years old, ranging 15 to 53, 20 male and 39 female) with 7 single lung, 11 double lung, and 41 heart-lung, whereas group 2 had 30 (43 +/- 2 years old, ranging 17 to 65, 9 male and 21 female) with 2 single, 20 double, and 8 heart-lung transplantations. The recipient age was significantly (p = 0.004) higher in group 2, and group 2 had significantly older (35 +/- 3 vs 26 +/- 1, p = 0.002) and more female donors (73% vs 41%, p = 0.007) compared with group 1. The actuarial survival was significantly (p = 0.004) better in group 2 with 86% at 1 year, 75% at 5 years, and 66% at 10 years compared with group 1 with 58% at 1 year, 39% at 5 years, and 27% at 10 years. With our current pulmonary protection and immunosuppression, the long-term outcome of lung and heart-lung transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is excellent.
