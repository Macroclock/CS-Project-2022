[Transplantation of the heart--indications, complications, therapy--our experience from investigations of 100 patients after cardiac transplantation]. Transplantation of the heart has become an accepted method for the treatment of terminal cardiac failure. Despite obvious advances in the care of patients after trasplantation a number of problems exist. The authors summarize their experience with the long-term follow-up of 100 adult patients with transplantations made in the Brno Centre of Cardiovascular and Transplantation Surgery. One-year survival in the group of patients is 80%, three-year survival 69%. The authors discuss indications and contraindications of cardiac transplantations, necessary preoperative and postoperative examinations, they follow-up the most serious complications during the posttransplantation period. They mention therapeutic possibilities and outline briefly the perspectives of care of patients after cardiac transplantation. Despite the number of problems encountered transplantation of the heart is for indicated patients with cardiac failure a unique chance to improve the prognosis of survival and the quality of life.
