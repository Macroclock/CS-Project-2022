Determinants and prognostic value of ischemic necrosis in early biopsies following heart transplant. To evaluate the impact of early ischemic necrosis (IN) on the early and late outcome of heart transplantation, we reviewed our 11-year experience. Between January 1988 and June 1999, 207 heart transplants were performed in 205 patients (174 male and 31 female). Criteria for donor and recipient selection, and protocols for postoperative immunosuppression and rejection monitoring have remained unchanged over this period. Three different cardioplegic solutions were employed in graft preservation: St. Thomas Hospital solution in the earliest 31 cases (15%), University of Wisconsin solution in 96 cases (46.4%), and Celsior solution in the last 80 cases (38.6%). All patients who underwent at least one endomyocardial biopsy (176 patients) were divided into two groups according to the findings of IN within the early 3 postoperative months (group A, 49 patients with IN; group B, 127 patients without IN). The following variables were estimated in each group: donor and recipient age, ischemic time, type of cardioplegia, late mortality for cardiac causes, incidence of grade >2 rejection within the first 6 postoperative months, late incidence of grade >2 rejection, late incidence of NYHA class >II. No significant difference was found in any parameter between the two groups, except for the type of cardioplegic solution. A significantly higher incidence of ischemic necrosis in hearts preserved with St. Thomas solution was found (P < 0.001). Although pathology findings show that extracellular solutions carried a higher risk of early IN, no associated significant impairment in terms of late survival and event-free rate was observed in recipients with early IN.
