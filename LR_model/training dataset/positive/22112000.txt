Outcomes of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia infections in pediatric heart transplant recipients. PJP is known to cause significant morbidity and rarely death in immunosuppressed patients. The prevalence and outcomes of PJP in pediatric solid-organ transplant patients are not well established. This study utilizes data from the PHTS to establish the prevalence and outcome of PJP in pediatric heart transplant recipients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the PHTS, including data from 24 institutions between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 2004. Infections that occur in PHTS subjects are recorded in a standardized data collection form. The prevalence and outcomes of PJP in pediatric heart transplant recipients were determined. There were a total of 18 patients (1%) with PJP out of the 1854 pediatric heart transplant recipients in the PHTS database. A majority of PJP occurred two months to two yr post-transplant, and patients with PJP had a significantly decreased mortality compared with other fungal infections. PJP is an infrequent complication experienced by pediatric heart transplant recipients. Patients that have experienced PJP have an increased survival compared to patients with other fungal infections, and most PJP occurred within two yr of transplant.
