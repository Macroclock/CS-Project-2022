Ten-year follow-up in patients with combined heart and kidney transplantation. Combined heart and kidney transplantation has been documented, although data regarding immunosuppression, rejection episodes, and graft or patient survival have not been detailed. We evaluated our experience and more than 10-year outcome with patients selected for combined heart and kidney transplantation. Eight patients aged 29 to 59 years were selected for combined heart and kidney transplantation. The indications were end-stage heart disease and underlying renal pathology, or secondary renal insufficiency, or renal failure. Six patients were dialysis dependent before transplantation. There were 7 simultaneous procedures and 1 staged procedure. The heart was transplanted first in all cases. All patients were maintained after transplantation on azathioprine (2 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) and whole-blood monoclonal cyclosporine levels at greater than 200 microg/L; prednisone was not decreased to less than 10 mg/d. Seven (87.5%) patients have survived a mean duration of 100.4 months (range, 51-144 months), and each allograft has continued to function. The only death was due to pulmonary emboli and was not related to allograft rejection or failure. Only 4 cardiac and 4 kidney allograft rejections have occurred. Five patients have been free of kidney rejection, 1 patient has been rejection free for more than 8 years, and no patient has had simultaneous rejection. In select patients, combined heart and kidney transplantation can provide long-term graft function and patient survival. The low rates of rejection support our current approach to immunosuppression. Our experience indicates that end-stage failure of either heart or kidney does not necessarily preclude dual-organ transplantation.
