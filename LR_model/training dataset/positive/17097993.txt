Does amiodarone influence early mortality in heart transplantation? The use of amiodarone before transplantation has been linked to an increased number of complications, acute graft failures, and early mortality after a heart graft. We undertook a retrospective, descriptive, case-controlled study involving early mortality and acute graft failure. The 396 consecutive patients included 25 subjects who had been prescribed amiodarone for at least 30 days before transplantation. We excluded retransplantations, pediatric transplantations, and combined transplantations. The endpoints were early mortality and acute graft failure. No significant differences were observed in early mortality and acute graft failures. The multivariate analysis did not reveal any variable that correlated with early mortality. Our study did not support the idea that amiodarone constituted a negative predictor of early survival or acute graft failure.
