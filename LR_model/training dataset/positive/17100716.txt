Relevance of cardioverter defibrillators for the prevention of sudden cardiac death on the timing of heart transplantation. Information on the incidence of decompensation of chronic heart failure (CHF) in heart transplantation (HT) candidates eligible for prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) could provide insights into the influence of ICD on the timing for HT. We investigated the prevalence of candidates satisfying SCD-HeFT and MADIT-II criteria for prophylactic ICD among patients (n = 317) with CHF referred to our tertiary center for HT. In addition to standard clinical and laboratory assessments, baseline evaluation included two-dimensional standard transthoracic echocardiogram and 12-lead electrocardiogram. At baseline, 19% of patients (n = 60) satisfied MADIT II criteria, and 58% (n = 185) fulfilled SCD-HeFT criteria. A total of 60% patients (n = 190) were eligible for prophylactic ICD implantation according to at least one set of criteria. Five-yr CHF decompensation-free survival was 68 +/- 4% in patients eligible for prophylactic ICD (p = 0.003), (RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.35-4.63). SCD-HeFT could imply a threefold rise in ICD eligibility in tertiary settings. As ICD-eligible patients would likely remain at high risk of progressive ventricular dysfunction, strict follow-up should be considered extremely important to allow a timely referral for HT.
