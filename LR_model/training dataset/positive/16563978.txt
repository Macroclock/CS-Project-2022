Outcome analysis of donor gender in heart transplantation. Several studies have shown a detrimental effect of female donor gender on the survival of solid-organ transplant recipients, including heart, kidney and liver. We evaluated our own experience in heart transplantation in the cyclosporine era, since 1980, to determine the effect of donor gender on survival. We retrospectively reviewed 869 consecutive patients who underwent primary heart transplantation at Stanford University Medical Center between December 1980 and March 2004. Actuarial life-table data were calculated for survival and freedom from rejection and compared between groups. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to identify predictors of reduced long-term survival. One-year mortality in male recipients who received a female donor heart (24%) was higher than in male recipients who received male donor heart (13%) (p = 0.009). Actuarial survival rates for male recipients at 1, 5 and 10 years were 86%, 69% and 50% (with male donor), and 76%, 59% and 45% (with female donor) (p = 0.01), respectively. Donor gender had no effect on long-term survival in male recipients < 45 years of age and female recipients. Female donor gender was identified as an independent risk factor for death by multivariate analysis, with an odds ratio of 2.3 (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 3.4, p < 0.001). In heart transplantation the detrimental effect of female donor gender on recipient survival is significant but limited to male recipients > 45 years of age. These findings should be considered in the process of donor-recipient matching.
