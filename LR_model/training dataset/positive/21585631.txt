Perioperative renal failure in pediatric heart transplant recipients: outcome and risk factors. PRF is encountered in 10-13% of adult heart transplants. Only one study of a single center's experience with PRF has been reported in pediatric patients. This study examines the effect of PRF on pediatric heart transplant outcome using the UNOS database. A total of 3598 patients met inclusion criteria, of whom 254 (7%) had PRF. The PRF group comprised 31 recipients requiring PRE and 223 recipients requiring POST. Compared with No-PRF patients, PRE patients had similar survival rate and POST patients had decreased survival rate at 30 days, one, five, and 10-yr post-transplant (p < 0.001). PRF patients also had significantly lower graft survival at one, five, and 10 yr (p < 0.001). Risk factors for developing PRF included ECMO, ventilator, and inotropic support at listing and CHD as the listing diagnosis. PRF increased the duration of hospital stay and the incidence of chronic severe renal dysfunction. PRF that requires POST (whether or not it began pretransplant) has a significant negative impact on pediatric heart transplant outcome. Specific characteristics identify patients at particular high risk of developing PRF.
