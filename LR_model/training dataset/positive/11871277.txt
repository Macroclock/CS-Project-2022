Substance abuse in heart transplant recipients: a 10-year follow-up study. Active substance abuse is widely accepted as a contraindication for heart transplantation because of the theory that relapse would occur after transplantation and result in compromise of graft function, lowering long-term survival. Listing "recovering" substance abusers for heart transplantation has been controversial. To determine if substance abuse plays an unfavorable role in the outcome of heart transplantation. The medical records of all patients at our center who received a heart transplant more than 10 years ago were retrospectively reviewed for history of substance abuse. From a pool of 189 transplant recipients, 47 patients had a definite history of substance abuse (group 1) and were considered in recovery, whereas 142 patients were clearly without any history of substance abuse (group 2). Group 1 had a significantly greater percentage of patients with a pretransplantation diagnosis of idiopathic cardiomyopathy (P = .003), a higher occurrence of heart-related cause of death (P = .017), and a significant prevalence of noncompliance (P = .0001) and death because of noncompliance (P = .0004). In contrast, group 2 surprisingly had a significantly higher incidence of death related to infection (P = .0062), which is unexplained. Despite higher incidence of noncompliance in group 1, there was no significant difference in the overall survival rate between the 2 groups. These results suggest that patients with a history of substance abuse can undergo successful heart transplantation with acceptable long-term survival, though they are at greater risk for substance abuse relapse and resulting noncompliance with the treatment regimen. The extent to which relapse of substance abuse and its consequences affect the cost of posttransplantation care remains to be determined.
