Cardiac transplantation and survival. I don't make any claims to be an expert in managing patients after cardiac transplantation, but I do recall 2 patients which I believe make the point that times have changed since the beginning of cardiac transplantation. In 1968, a patient of mine underwent cardiac transplantation. This was the first transplantation done at Johns Hopkins, and I believe it was 99(th) in the world. This patient survived the surgery very well, left the hospital, and in 4 wk he was dead.
