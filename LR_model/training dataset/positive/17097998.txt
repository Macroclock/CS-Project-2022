Influence of immunosuppression regimen on heart transplantation survival. To perform an analysis comparing long-term survival in heart transplant (HT) patients depending on the immunosuppressive regimen. The study included 317 consecutive HT patients. We excluded pediatric cases, retransplants, combined transplants (lung and kidney), and immunosuppressive regimens with fewer than 10 cases. The six groups analyzed were: (1) OKT3 7 days + cyclosporine (CsA) + mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) + steroids (S); (2) OKT3 7 days + CsA + azathioprine (AZA) + S; (3) OKT3 10 days + CsA + MMF + S; (4) OKT3 10 days + CsA + AZA + S; (5) interleukin-2 (IL-2) antagonists + CsA + MMF + S; and (6) IL-2 antagonists + tacrolimus + MMF + S. Probability of survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank methods. The groups were heterogeneous regarding the number of patients and follow-up. The baseline characteristics were similar, although there were differences in surgery times. The survivals by groups at the end of the follow-up period were: group 1: 75.8%; group 2: 51.2%; group 3: 63.6%; group 4: 25.3%; group 5: 91.2%; and group 6: 84.6%. A major reduction in survival was observed in the groups that were given induction with OKT3 monoclonal antibodies (groups 1, 2, 3, and 4), particularly when AZA was combined in the maintenance phase (groups 2 and 4) and when the induction dose was high (10-day therapy in groups 3 and 4). Our study suggested an association between the immunosuppressive regimen and the long-term survival of HT patients. The best results were obtained with an induction regimen based on IL-2 antagonists. On the basis of the survivals observed in this study, the maintenance combination we regard as "optimal" at this time is based on a combination of CsA, MMF, and steroids.
