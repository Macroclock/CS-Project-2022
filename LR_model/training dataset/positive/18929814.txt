Heart transplantation under cyclosporine or tacrolimus combined with mycophenolate mofetil or everolimus. In this study, we examined whether cyclosporine was effective when combined with everolimus in clinical heart transplantation (HT). From August 2004 to July 2007, 108 adult patients underwent primary HT. The main exclusion criteria were: donors > 60 years; cold ischemia times > 6 hours; recipients of multiorgan transplantation or a previous transplantation; and panel-reactive antibodies > or = 25%. The cyclosporine plus everolimus regimen (group CE, n = 32) was suggested first; upon refusal or if the recipient or donor was positive for hepatitis B surface antigen or PCR + hepatitis C infection, then patient was randomly assigned to success cyclosporine plus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; group CM, n = 24) or tacrolimus plus MMF (group TM, n = 25). All patients underwent similar operative procedures and postoperative care with protocol endomyocardial biopsies. No 30-day mortality was noted in any group. The efficacy failure rates were 3%, 25%, and 16% in groups CE, CM, and TM, respectively (P = .04 between groups CE and CM). The 1-year survivals were 96.7% +/- 18.1%, 89.7% +/- 29.8%, and 81.0% +/- 35.5% for groups CE, CM, and TM, respectively (P = .04 between groups CE and TM). The 3-year survival rates were 91.9% +/- 28.3%, 79.8% +/- 46.0%, and 81.0% +/- 35.5% in groups CE, CM, and TM, respectively. The 3 immunosuppressive regimens offered good efficacy after HT. The cyclosporine plus everolimus regimen showed a significantly better result with less efficacy failure (compared with cyclosporine plus MMF: 3% vs 25%) and better 1-year survival compared with tacrolimus plus MMF: 96.7% vs 81.0%.
