Clinical experience with Berlin Heart Excor in pediatric patients in Argentina: 1373 days of cardiac support. The objective of this study was to describe our experience (1373 days of support) with the Berlin Heart Excor (BH) ventricular-assist device (VAD) as bridging to cardiac transplantation in pediatric patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy. This study involved a retrospective observational cohort. Records of patients supported with the BH VAD were reviewed. Data regarding age, sex, weight, diagnosis, preoperative condition, single versus biventricular support, morbidity, and mortality were collected. Criteria for single versus biventricular support and intensive care unit management were registered. The procedure was approved by our Institutional Ethics Committee, and informed consent was obtained. Between March 2006 and March 2010, 12 patients with diagnosis of dilated (n = 10) and restrictive (n = 2) cardiomyopathy were supported. Median age was 56.6 months (range 20.1-165.9); mean weight was 18.3 kg (range 8.5-45); and nine patients were female. Every patient presented with severe heart failure refractory to pharmacological therapy. Biventricular support was necessary in four patients. Nine patients underwent heart transplantation. No child was weaned off the BH VAD because of myocardial recovery. Mean length of support was 73 days (range 3-331), and the total number of days of support was 1373. Three patients had fatal complications: 2 had thrombo-hemorrhagic stroke leading to brain death, and one had refractory vasoplegic shock. The BH VAD is a useful and reasonable safe device for cardiac transplantation bridging in children with end-stage heart failure. Team experience resulted in less morbidity and mortality, and time for implantation, surgical procedure, anticoagulation monitoring, and patient care improved.
