Is third-time heart retransplantation justifiable? Since repeat heart transplantation traditionally carries higher risk than primary engraftment, we tested the hypothesis that third-time cardiac allograft transplantation is associated with prohibitive mortality and morbidity. The cohort of all third-time cardiac retransplants performed at our institution (n=3) and reported to UNOS from 1987 to 2002 (n=10) was reviewed. The primary endpoints were early and late mortality. Extending the study frame through 2003 captures a total of 5 and 15 third-time heart transplant recipients in UCLA and UNOS databases, respectively. Of the 15 patients undergoing third-time retransplants, preoperatively one was ventricular assist device-dependent, four were on intravenous inotropes, and two had creatinine levels greater than 2.5. Additionally, four were male recipients of female donor hearts and the mean donor ischemic time was 2.6 hours. One patient was diagnosed with acute allograft rejection, 13 with coronary artery vasculopathy/chronic rejection, and one with primary graft failure. At our institution, five patients underwent a third heart transplant. There was no early or hospital mortality. One patient died late from transplant coronary artery disease and another following a fourth allograft. The mortality rate for third-time heart allograft recipients is acceptable. These results are influenced by small sample size, younger age, case selection, and operations at select, high-volume institutions with significant experience.
