The influence of donor characteristics on survival after heart transplantation. With improved immunosuppressive regimens, transplantation techniques, and postoperative care, heart transplantation (HTx) has been established as a definite therapy for end-stage heart disease. Because of a donor shortage, we have accepted marginal individuals. In this study, we identified donor-related factors influencing survival after HTx by retrospective analysis of recipient data after primary HTx from February 2002 to December 2006. The Cox regression model was used to examine the effects of the following variables on survival of 112 heart transplant recipients: demographic data of gender, age, body weight, donor-recipient body weight ratio; history of smoking, alcohol drinking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis C virus antibody; donor condication before transplantation including catecholamine doses, hypotension, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, creatine MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CK-MB), tropinin I, and cold ischemic time of the allograft. Catecholamines and smoking showed significant influences on HTx survival. In our series, the percentage of donors receiving inotropic support before donation was 88% (n = 99), and the percentage of donors with a history of smoking was 25% (n = 28). There was no influence of donor status of diabetes, hypertension, or hepatitis B or C infection on postoperative survival. Our results showed that inotropic support of and a history of smoking by the donor were significant factors influencing posttransplant survival.
