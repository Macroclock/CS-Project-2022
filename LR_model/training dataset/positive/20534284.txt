Results with cyclosporine monotherapy in long-term cardiac transplant recipients. Triple therapy is the gold standard after heart transplantation while few reports have described experiences with cyclosporine monotherapy (CM). We have analyzed our experience with CM in long-term heart transplant recipients, surviving >5 years. Of the 219 patients transplanted between January 1990 and December 1998, 143 survived >5 years (mean age, 49.6 +/- 10.4). There were 124 (86.7%) male subjects. Matching patients respect to follow-up length, we obtained 2 groups: group A of 41 patients on double therapy (DT; cyclosporine plus Azathioprine) and group B of 41 patients on CM. After a mean follow-up of 119.8 +/- 32.2 months, we did not observe a significant difference in terms of survival and major events: heart failure, malignancy, dialysis, infections, and CAV. We strongly support the use of triple therapy in cardiac transplant recipients because of its known safety and efficacy. However, our experience with CM suggests the utility of this approach.
