[Survival, clinical data and quality of life 10 years after heart transplantation: a prospective study]. To study prospectively patients after heart transplantation with respect to quality of life, mortality, morbidity, and clinical parameters before and up to 10 years after the operation. Sixty patients (47.9 +/- 10.9 years, 57 men, 3 women) were transplanted at the University of Vienna Hospital, Department for Heart and Thorax Surgery and were included in this study. They were assessed when set on the waiting list, then exactly one, 5 and 10 years after the transplantation. The variables evaluated included physical and emotional complaints, well-being, mortality and morbidity. In the sample of patients who survived 10 years (n = 23), morbidity (infections, malignancies, graft arteriosclerosis, and rejection episodes) as well as quality of life were evaluated. Actuarial survival rates were 83.3, 66.7, 48.3% at 1, 5, and 10 years after transplantation, respectively. During the first year, infections were the most important reasons for premature death. As a cause of mortality, malignancies were found between years 1 and 5, and graft arteriosclerosis between years 5 and 10. Physical complaints diminished significantly after the operation, but grew significantly during the period from 5 to 10 years (p < 0.001). However, trembling (p < 0.05) and paraesthesies (p < 0.01) diminished continuously. Emotional complaints such as depression and dysphoria (both p < 0.05) increased until the tenth year after their nadir at year 1. In long-time survivors, 3 malignancies (lung, skin, thyroidea) were diagnosed 6 to 9 years postoperatively. Three patients (13%) had signs of graft arteriosclerosis at year 10; 9 (40%) patients suffered from rejection episodes during the course of 10 years. There were no serious rejection episodes deserving immediate therapy. Quality of life at 10 years is good in these patients. Heart transplantation is a successful therapy for patients with terminal heart disease. Long-term survivors feel well after 10 years and report a good quality of life.
