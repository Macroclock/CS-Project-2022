The impact of renal failure on survival following cardiac transplantation. Renal failure after cardiac transplantation is a common and serious complication. In this study we investigated the incidence and effects of renal failure on survival among patients who underwent cardiac transplantation. Eight patients underwent cardiac and one patient combined cardiac and renal transplantation. The mean age of the patients was 33 +/- 11.6 years (range, 17 to 51). On preoperative echocardiographic evaluation, the mean ejection fraction was calculated as 19 +/- 3.11% (range, 16% to 24%). One patient had compensated renal failure and one patient, dialysis-dependent renal failure. Hemofiltration was routinely used during the operations. Corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil were used for immunosuppression. Early renal replacement therapy was performed in patients with acute renal failure. The incidence of acute renal failure was 55.5% (5 patients). In the early postoperative and follow-up periods, the mean ejection fraction was 55 +/- 9.9% and 57 +/- 4.5%, respectively. The mean follow-up period was 21.3 +/- 8.8 (range, 6 to 33) months. In the early initiation period, the mean peak value of cyclosporine blood level was 479 +/- 201.8 ng/mL during the first month, 250 +/- 95.3 and after the third month, 195 +/- 43.7 ng/mL. The mean creatinine level at last follow-up was 1.27 +/- 0.4. One patient experienced a grade III-A rejection episode. One patient died due to coronary artery occlusive disease at 31 months after transplantation. In our study we have observed that renal failure had no negative effect on patient survival. This can be explained by improved cardiac performance, keeping cyclosporine levels low finding and utilizing early renal replacement treatment.
