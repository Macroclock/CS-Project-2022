Effect of Baohuoside-1 aglycone and tacrolimus monotherapy and combination therapy on prevention of acute heart allograft rejection in the rat. Baohuoside-1 (B-1), a recently introduced novel immunosuppressant that was proved to be potent in inhibition of T and B cell proliferation and B-1, also prevents cardiac allograft rejection in rodents. The present study further proved that monotherapy of B-1's analogue B-1 aglycone effectively prolongs cardiac allograft survival and combination therapy of B-1 aglycone with tacrolimus (FK506) produces synergistic effect in prevention acute cardiac allograft rejection in the rat. .
