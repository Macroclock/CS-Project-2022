[Circulatory assistance while waiting for heart transplantation. Clinical course]. In most cases, mechanical circulatory assistance prior to transplantation can restore the main vital functions allowing a progressive physical rehabilitation during the period of assistance. According to several international registries, the transplantation rate ranges from 62% to 69% and the proportion of transplanted patients who had circulatory assistance and who were discharged ranges from 65% to 69%. Bleeding (42.5%), right heart failure (20-25%), air embolism and multiple organ failure are the main causes of early morbidity and mortality. Infection (28.5%), thromboembolic events and technical failures are the most frequent late complications. The optimal time for transplantation is the moment when the incidence of complications and technical problems for transplantation are at their minima while the patient's vital functions are at their maxima.
