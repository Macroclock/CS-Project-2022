Acute renal failure early after heart transplantation: risk factors and clinical consequences. Limited information exists about acute renal failure (ARF) early after heart transplantation (HTx). We correlated pre-, per-, and post-operative patient and donor parameters to the risk of developing ARF. We also analyzed the consequences of ARF on kidney function after HTx, risk of later need for chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, and mortality. In a retrospective study from 1983 to 2007, 145 (25%) of 585 HTx recipients developed ARF, defined as ≥ 26.4 micromol/L or ≥ 50% increase in serum creatinine from pre-operatively to the seventh day post-HTx and/or the need of early post-operative dialysis. Independent risk factors for ARF were intravenous cyclosporine immediately post-operatively (odds ratio [OR] 2.16, 95% CI 1.34-3.50, p = 0.02), donor age (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00-1.04, p = 0.02), and pre-operative cardiac output (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.12-1.71, p = 0.003). The development of ARF was a predictor for short-term survival (≤ 3 months) ranging from 98% for patients who improved their creatinine after HTx vs. 79% for those in need of dialysis (p < 0.001). However, ARF did not predict subsequent end stage renal disease in need of dialysis or renal transplantation. ARF is a common complication post-HTx. As ARF is associated with short-term survival, post-operative strategies of preserving renal function have the potential of reducing mortality. Of avoidable risk factors, the use of intravenous CsA should be discouraged.
