Results of percutaneous revascularization in cardiac allograft vascular disease. To evaluate the outcome of transplant patients with CGD treated by PTCA in our center. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of all PTCA procedures performed on heart transplant patients in our hospital. Among 13 patients (11 men, 52.9+/-9.7 years), 20 lesions were treated with PTCA with 95% initial angiographic success. The indications for PTCA was heart failure or ventricular systolic dysfunction (n=4), of ischemia (n=4) and angiographic criteria alone (n=5). Ten lesions were treated with balloon angioplasty. A stent was implanted in 10 lesions, including one patient with a previous atherectomy. There were no complications. Angiographic follow-up was performed on 11 patients, four of whom (36%) showed restenosis. Mean follow-up was 33 months. Four patients (30.8%) are alive without retransplantation, two (15.4%) are alive after retransplantation, and seven (53.4%) died, all from cardiac causes. Graft survival rates estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method were 62% in the first year and 46% in the second year. Our results suggest that PTCA represents a palliative method of treatment for heart transplant patients with CGD.
