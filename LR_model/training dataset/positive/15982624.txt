Impact of donor serum sodium levels on outcome after heart transplantation. We investigated the impact of elevated donor serum sodium levels on outcome after heart transplantation in 336 consecutive heart transplantations. Mean donor serum sodium was 148.2+/-10.2 mmol/liter (range 116 to 180 mmol/liter). Recipients were divided into 4 groups with serum sodium levels of 141, 147 and 155 mmol/liter, resulting in sodium levels of: 133+/-6.1 mmol/liter for Quartile A; 144+/-4.2 mmol/liter for Quartile B; 151+/-4.3 mmol/liter for Quartile C; and 162+/-6.6 mmol/liter for Quartile D, respectively (mean+/- standard deviation). Mean occurrence of primary graft failure (PGF) was 3.6% with the following quartile breakdown: A, 3.6%; B, 4.8%; C, 3.6%; and D, 2.4% (p=non-significant [NS]). Mean 5-year survival was 81.32% with: A, 83.51%; B, 76.03%; C, 80.47%; and D, 85.25% (p=NS). Coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) occurred in 19% of patients with a quartile breakdown of: A, 16.5%; B, 21%; C, 20%; and D, 14.5% (p=NS). No impact of donor serum sodium levels was seen on early post-operative results or on long-term outcome, indicating that cardiac allografts from donors with elevated sodium levels may be transplanted successfully with favorable results.
