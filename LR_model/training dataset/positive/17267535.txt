Poor prognosis of heart transplant patients with end-stage renal failure. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal failure (ESRF) are major complications after a heart transplant. The aim of this study is to compare survival in heart transplant (HT) vs non-heart transplant (non-HT) patients starting dialysis. Survival was studied among the 539 newly dialysed patients between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2005 in our Department. All patients were prospectively followed from the date of first dialysis up to death or 31 December 2005. Multivariate survival analysis adjusted on baseline characteristics was performed with the Cox model. There were 21 HT patients and they were younger than non-HT patients at first dialysis: 58.6+/-11.6 vs 63.0+/-16.2 years (P=0.09). Calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity was the main cause of ESRF in HT patients (47.6%). Crude 1, 3 and 5-year survival rates in HT and in non-HT patients were as follows: 76.2%, 57.1%, 28.6% and 79.1%, 58.7%, 46.7% (P=0.2). The adjusted hazard ratio of death in HT vs non-HT patients was 2.27 [1.33-3.87], P=0.003. Sudden death was the main cause of death in HT patients, in 33.3% vs 10.4% in non-HT patients (P=0.01). Five HT patients benefited from renal transplant. They were all alive at the end of the study period, while one patient among the 16 remaining on dialysis survived. HT patients with CKD who reached ESRF have a poor outcome after starting dialysis in comparison with other ESRF patients. Improvement in renal function management in the case of CKD is needed in these patients and non-nephrotoxic immunosuppressive regimens have to be evaluated. Renal transplant should be the ESRF treatment of choice in HT patients.
