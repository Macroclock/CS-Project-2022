Long-term safety and effectiveness of statins for heart transplant recipients in routine clinical practice. Whereas the efficacy of statins after heart transplantation (HT) in controlled study settings has been clearly demonstrated, more extensive data are required on the safety and effectiveness of long-term treatment in routine clinical practice. We analyzed the risks and benefits in clinical practice of treatment with statins in all patients who survived HT for at least a month from December 1985 through 2001. During a mean follow-up of 4.8+/-3.8 years, 186 patients were treated with statins (for a median duration [25th to 75th percentile] of 29 [12 to 54] months), while 48 received dietary therapy alone. Patients treated with statins (pravastatin, 48%; atorvastatin, 37%; simvastatin, 14%) presented linearized rates of rhabdomyolisis, myositis, and significant transaminase elevation of 0.37%, 0.74%, and 0.37% per year of treatment, respectively (no fatal event occurred). Low-density lipoprotein decreased after statins by 19% (P<.001). At multivariate analysis, treatment with statins was independently associated with reduced risk of cardiac allograft vasculopathy and overall mortality (P<.001). Our data provide necessary confirmation of the safety and effectiveness in routine clinical practice of appropriately monitored long-term administration of statins (particularly atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin) in the chronic post-HT phase. Strict follow-up is needed for HT recipients receiving high doses of statins with/without other medications potentially exacerbating the risk of adverse effects.
