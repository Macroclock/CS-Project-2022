Medium-term outcomes in cardiac transplant recipients in a single cardiac transplant center in Taiwan. This study retrospectively investigated the outcomes of cardiac transplantation in a single medical center in Taiwan. From February 1997 to December 2005, 214 orthotopic cardiac transplantations were performed in our institution. Cumulative survival rates were compared by gender, waiting status, blood type, ischemia time, donor gender, age, and cause of brain death. The cumulative survival rates were significant different among recipient waiting status (P = .0026), blood type (P = .0376), and donor age > 40 years (P = .0260). The others parameters seem to not be different from the cumulative survival rate. There was a strong association between donors > 40 years old and increased postoperative mortality. The age of a marginal donor seemed to be > 40 years in this study.
