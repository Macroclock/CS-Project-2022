[The heart transplant in Lausanne from 1987 to 2003]. Since the availability of ciclosporine, the survival after heart transplantation has dramatically improved. We present our results since the beginning of our experience in 1987. We treated in the Lausanne University hospital, 150 patients for end-stage cardiac disease. Hundred and fifty-two transplantations were performed. The survival rate is comparable to the literature with 81% at one year, 70% at five year and 63 at ten year included the hospital mortality. We review the incidence of complications during the follow-up and report the modification in the management of these patients especially concerning the immunosuppression.
