[To the margin of the one hundredth Hungarian heart transplantation: an analyzing review]. On the 28th of September, 2006 was performed the one hundredth heart transplantation (HTX) at the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery of Semmelweis University in Budapest, just 15 years after the beginning of the Hungarian HTX project. This fact provides the occasion for this analyzing review. The relatively high (15.68%) hospital mortality was caused mainly by the frequent occurrence of acute graft failure due to the poor recipient's selection possibilities. The Kaplan-Meier method has found a 56% five year and a 46% ten year long survival rate. The vast majority of the 63 surviving patients (95%) is in NYHA I functional class. The late deaths are caused most frequently by malignancy. Authors state that further increase in the HTX activity might be reached only by creating a longer waiting list since at the very moment there are only eight patients on it.
