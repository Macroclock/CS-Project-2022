A prospective randomized study comparing cyclosporine versus tacrolimus combined with daclizumab, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids in heart transplantation. Cyclosporine (CsA) and tacrolimus (Tac) in heart transplantation (HTx) have been compared but with certain drawbacks. We compared both drugs in a prospective analysis with medium-term follow-up. Hundred and six patients were randomized to receive CsA or Tac (53 per group). Target levels of CsA were 200-300 ng/mL in the first six months and 100-200 ng/mL thereafter. Tac levels were 10-15 and 5-10 ng/mL, respectively. We also used daclizumab as induction and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and steroids as maintenance therapy. Baseline characteristics were similar. Survival (CsA 88.7% vs. Tac 81.1%; p = 0.493) was similar. There was a tendency for longer time to first rejection with CsA (93 ± 110 vs. 55 ± 81 d; p = 0.122). There were more rejection-free patients with Tac (39 vs. 28%; p = 0.233). CsA patients suffered more viral infections (0.41 ± 0.58 vs. 0.11 ± 0.31; p = 0.003). CsA patients developed hypertension often (64 vs. 43%; p = 0.032). Tac patients suffered more gastrointestinal complications (16 vs. 6%; p = 0.042). Renal function and the development of diabetes, dyslipidemia, or neurological complications was similar. Tac patients showed a tendency for longer time to first rejection, and there were more rejection-free patients with Tac and suffered fewer viral infections. Tac patients developed less hypertension and needed less drugs for its control. Renal function was similar in both groups.
