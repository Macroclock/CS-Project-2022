Incidence and importance of de novo diabetes mellitus after heart transplantation. Diabetes mellitus is one of the main metabolic complications after heart transplantation. The aims of our study were to determine the incidence and factors that determine the appearance of posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) and its prognostic value. We performed a retrospective study of all heart transplant recipients in our hospital from January 1993 to December 2005, including 116 patients with prolonged monitoring with 59-month median follow-up. We divided the patients into two groups, according to whether they had de novo diabetes (group 1) or no diabetes (group 2). Patients with PTDM were significantly older, with a median difference (MD) of 5.4 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.53-9.28) and a greater body mass index (MD, 3.37 kg/m(2); 95% CI, 1.68-5.06). Moreover, a greater percentage of patients in group 1 had ischemia compared to other etiologies. However, no significant differences were observed regarding other cardiovascular risk factors. PTDM was associated with a greater incidence of posttransplant hypertension (51.6% in group 1 vs 48.4% in group 2, P = .08) and posttransplant renal failure (59.5% in group 1 vs 40.5% in group 2, P = .001). However, no differences were observed in overall survival. Age, overweight, and ischemic origin of cardiopathy were the main risk factors for the development of PTDM in our population. Although no differences were observed in survival rates, PTDM was associated with a greater incidence of hypertension and renal insufficiency, which may have long-term influences on patient survival.
