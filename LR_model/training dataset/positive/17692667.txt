Possible role of everolimus in improving renal function in long-term heart transplantation. Patient survival after heart transplantation has improved dramatically since the availability of calcineurine inhibitor (CNIs); the number of long-term patients is progressively increasing. However, in these patients, nephrotoxicity of CNIs has been largely responsible for the progressive development of renal dysfunction. Since impaired renal function is an important issue that reduces long-term patient survival, it is important to develop strategies to improve renal function while maintaining immunologic safety to preserve graft function. Everolimus is an mTOR inhibitor sirolimus analogue, that has proved, to be highly efficacious to prevent acute myocardial rejection and reduce the severity of cardiac allograft vasculopathy in de novo HTx patients. There is reasonable evidence that, in long term heart transplanted patients, renal function may improve when everolimus is administered associated with a progressive reduction of CNIs. So far there is no evidence to identify which patient may benefit from this therapeutic approach. Indeed everolimus alone may be equally effective to prevent rejection and improve renal function when CNIs are completely discontinued, but data are still lacking on the risks, dosages and side effects of this type of immunosuppression. Ongoing clinical studies will provide further guidance about the possibility to halt or reduce the progression of renal impairment in long term heart transplant patients.
