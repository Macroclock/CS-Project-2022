[Spanish Heart Transplantation Registry. 16th official report of the Spanish Society of Cardiology Working Group on Heart Failure, Heart Transplantation, and Associated Therapies]. This paper describes the general situation regarding heart transplantation in Spain and the results obtained using the technique, incorporating data for the year 2004. In 2004, 294 heart transplants were carried out, which brings the total number of procedures performed since 1984 to 4680. Clinically, the typical heart transplant recipient in Spain is male, aged around 50 years, has blood group A, has non-revascularizable coronary artery disease, and is in NYHA functional class IV/IV. The percentage of emergency heart transplantations was 35%, which is higher than in the previous year (29%), and higher than the mean for the preceding 5 years (22%). The early mortality rate was 10%, which is lower that the mean for the preceding 5 years (13%). After combining the results for 2004 with those of previous years, the probability of survival at 1, 5 and 10 years was 80%, 70% and 60%, respectively. When the survival rates for different time periods were analyzed, a significant improvement could be seen in the last 5 years, with recent survival rates being 85% and 72% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. The most frequent cause of death in the first month was acute graft failure; in the first year, infection and rejection; and, over the long term, tumors and a combination of graft vasculopathy and sudden death. A comparative analysis of survival rates showed that long-term results in Spain are slightly better than those published in the world literature. Moreover, survival has tended to improve gradually in recent years.
