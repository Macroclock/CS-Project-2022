Use of two recipient lists for adults requiring heart transplantation. An alternate (second) adult recipient list was used to match excluded potential recipients with nonstandard donor hearts that would otherwise be unused. The only absolute criterion for entering the alternate recipient list was age: 65 years old before 1998 and 70 years old after that. Group I consisted of alternates who underwent transplantation, and group II consisted of 401 contemporaneous recipients. Hearts were first offered to regularly listed patients. At least one of the following donor risks accounted for allocation to an alternate: coronary artery disease, reused transplanted heart, high-risk behavior, hepatitis seropositivity, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, high inotropic requirement, left ventricular hypertrophy, age older than 55 years plus another risk, and small donor with no other matches. Of 102 alternates, 82 were listed were because of age. After a median wait of 107 days, 62 alternates underwent transplantation. Median alternate recipient age was 67 years (vs 54 years, P <.001). Median donor age was 45 years (vs 31 years, P <.001). Survival for alternates at 90 days was 82% (vs 91%, P =.04). Significant recipient predictors of early mortality on multivariable analysis (n = 463) were previous cardiac surgery (odds ratio 2.74, 95% confidence interval 1.37-5.48) and renal dysfunction (odds ratio 1.39, 1.10-176). Alternate listing did not independently predict early or late mortality. Late (>90 days) death rates per 1000 person-months were 4.3 and 3.6 for groups I and II (relative risk 1.2, 0.62-2.36). Use of two adult recipient lists facilitated allocation of unused donor organs. Satisfactory long-term survival supports the use of an alternate recipient list.
