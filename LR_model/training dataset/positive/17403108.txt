Heart transplantation in insulin-treated diabetic mellitus patients with diabetes-related complications. Heart transplantation is the most effective therapy for end-stage heart failure in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, diabetes-related complications (DRCs) are a relative contraindication for heart transplantation. Nevertheless, the increasing prevalence of both DM and congestive heart failure makes it necessary to perform heart transplantation even in those patients with advanced DM. We performed a retrospective analysis on long-term survival in 47 patients with insulin-treated DM and DRCs (group 1). Survival rate and causes of death were compared with data of a group of heart transplant recipients without DM (n = 1061, group 2). Mean follow-up time of all heart transplant recipients was 68.2 months (range: 0-204 months). Overall mortality during follow-up was 42.9%. Long-term survival did not differ significantly between study groups, but tended to be shorter in group 1 than in group 2 (P = 0.07). In group 1, steroid-free immunosuppressive therapy was associated with a higher percentage of long-term survivors compared with no steroid-free immunosuppression. Our data demonstrate that long-term survival is acceptable in heart transplant recipients with preoperatively diagnosed DM and DRCs. Consequently, advanced DM should no longer be a relative contraindication for heart transplantation.
