Pulmonary resection following lung transplantation. The morbidity of lung transplantation is higher than other solid organ transplants. Little is known about the outcomes of patients who require pulmonary resection following lung transplantation. We reviewed our experience to evaluate and discern any variables affecting outcome of pulmonary resections performed following lung transplantation. A retrospective review of the lung transplant database was performed. Data are presented as mean +/- standard error (median). A total of 136 lung transplants (80 single lung transplants [SLT], 55 bilateral lung transplants [BLT], and 3 heart-lung transplants [HLT]) were performed from August 1995 to February 2002. Twelve pulmonary resections, 7 lobectomies, and 5 wedge resections were performed on 11 patients. The indication for lobectomy was infection in 5 of 7 lobectomies (3 fungal, 2 bacterial), mass in 1 of 7, and infarction in 1 of 7. The indication for wedge resection was native lung hyperinflation in 4 of 5 wedge resections and mass in 1 of 5. The native lung was resected in 3 of 7 lobectomies and 4 of 5 wedge resections. An allograft lobectomy was performed following 1 SLT and 3 BLT and a wedge resection was performed after 1 SLT. The mean time to pulmonary resection was 12.4 +/- 3.9 (9.1) months. Survival postresection was 17.2 +/- 5.8 (8.3) months and 5 of 11 patients are still alive. There were no bronchial stump leaks following lobectomy. Major pulmonary resections can safely be performed following lung transplant. We recommend early intervention to optimize outcomes.
