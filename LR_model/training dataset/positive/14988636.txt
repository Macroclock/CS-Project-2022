Cardiac xenotransplantation: future and limitations. Despite improvements in pharmacological therapies, the outlook for patients with severe cardiac disease remains poor. At present, only transplantation can 'cure' end-stage cardiac failure. However, fewer than 5% of those who need a cardiac transplant receive one in the United States each year. To address this problem, some propose using animals as a source of organs for transplantation, that is, xenotransplantation. Here, we discuss the rationale for xenotransplantation beyond overcoming the shortage of human organs, and we weigh xenotransplantation against other new technologies that might be used for the treatment of cardiac failure.
