A review of the United States experience with combined heart-liver transplantation. Since first described by Starzl, combined heart and liver transplantation (CHLT) has been a relatively rare event, although utilization has increased in the past decade. This study was undertaken to review the United States experience with this procedure; UNOS data on CHLT was reviewed. CHLT was compared with liver transplantation alone and heart transplantation alone in terms of acute rejection within 12 months, graft survival, and patient survival. Survival was calculated according to Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards. Continuous variables were compared using Student's t-test and categorical variables with chi-squared. Between 1987 and 2010, there were 97 reported cases of CHLT in the United States. Amyloidosis was the most common indication for both heart (n = 26, 26.8%) and liver (n = 27, 27.8%) transplantation in this cohort. Liver graft survival in the CHLT cohort at 1, 5, and 10 years was 83.4%, 72.8%, and 71.0%, whereas survival of the cardiac allograft was 83.5%, 73.2%, and 71.5%. This was similar to graft survival in liver alone transplantation (79.4%, 71.0%, 65.1%; P = 0.894) and heart transplantation alone (82.6%, 71.9%, 63.2%; P = 0.341). CHLT is a safe and effective procedure, with graft survival rates similar to isolated heart and isolated liver transplantation.
