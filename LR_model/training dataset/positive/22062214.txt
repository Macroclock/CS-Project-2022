Right ventricular dysfunction in patients undergoing left ventricular assist device implantation: predictors, management, and device utilization. Nonreversible failure of the right ventricle is seen in 0.04% to 0.1% of postcardiotomy cases. The incidence of right ventricular dysfunction after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation that fails to resolve in the operating room is reported to be as frequent as 20% to 50% and imposes a considerable burden in terms of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Should this syndrome supervene, the mortality of an LVAD operation increases from 19% to 43%. Although most patients can be maintained with prolonged inotropic support, 10% to 15% may require implantation of a separate right ventricular support device.
