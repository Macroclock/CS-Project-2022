Improved survival in pediatric heart transplant recipients: have white, black and Hispanic children benefited equally? We assessed whether the improvement in posttransplant survival in pediatric heart transplant (HT) recipients during the last two decades has benefited the major racial groups in the United States equally. We analyzed all children <18 years of age who underwent their first HT in the US during 1987-2008. We compared trends in graft loss (death or retransplant) in white, black and Hispanic children in five successive cohorts (1987-1992, 1993-1996, 1997-2000, 2001-2004, 2005-2008). The primary endpoint was early graft loss within 6 months posttransplant. Longer-term survival was assessed in recipients who survived the first 6 months. The improvement in early posttransplant survival was similar (hazard ratio [HR] for successive eras 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7, 0.9, p = 0.24 for black-era interaction, p = 0.22 for Hispanic-era interaction) in adjusted analysis. Longer-term survival was worse in black children (HR 2.2, CI 1.9, 2.5) and did not improve in any group with time (HR 1.0 for successive eras, CI 0.9, 1.1, p = 0.57; p = 0.19 for black-era interaction, p = 0.21 for Hispanic-era interaction). Thus, the improvement in early post-HT survival during the last two decades has benefited white, black and Hispanic children equally. Disparities in longer-term survival have not narrowed with time; the survival remains worse in black recipients.
