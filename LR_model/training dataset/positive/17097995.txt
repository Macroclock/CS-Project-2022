Induction therapy with daclizumab in heart transplantation--how many doses? Since their introduction onto the market, interleukin-2 antagonists have been increasingly used by a growing number of transplant units. Their benefits versus OKT3 appear evident, although the optimal dose remains to be established. Our objective was to establish possible differences related to the use of two versus five doses of daclizumab. This study evaluated 81 consecutive patients treated with two bolus doses of daclizumab (1 mg/kg) on days 1 and 14 posttransplantation. We excluded retransplantations, pediatric transplantations, and combined transplantations. We compared our series to a previous trial involving the administration of a single bolus dose every 14 days (five boluses in total). Study variables included the number of graft rejections, the number of infections, and the mortality. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi square and Student's t tests. Significance was set at P < .05. There were no differences between groups in the baseline characteristics of the patients. The number of rejection episodes during the first year was significantly lower among the patients in our series treated with two bolus doses of daclizumab than in the series of patients treated with five bolus doses: 24 (30%) vs 17 (61%) episodes (P = .003). No significant differences were observed for mortality: the group receiving two boluses registered 10 deaths (12%) versus two (7%) in the group receiving five boluses (P = .4), or infection rate: 11 patients (40%) in the group receiving five bolus versus 31 patients (38%) in the group given two bolus doses (P = .9). Our results suggested that induction therapy with two doses of daclizumab was at least as effective in preventing rejection as five doses, with no negative effects on patient survival.
