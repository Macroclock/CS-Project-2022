Registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: tenth official pediatric lung and heart/lung transplantation report--2007. This tenth official pediatric report of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) covers the international pediatric lung and heart-lung transplantation experience from 1982 to 2006. As of last year's report, pediatric lung and heart-lung transplant data are now reported separately from pediatric heart transplant data and adult lung transplant data. For the first time this year, Registry data are analyzed by geographic region in addition to the usual aggregate analyses. All figures and tables included in this report and additional supplementary slides are available from the ISHLT website (www.ishlt.org/registries).
