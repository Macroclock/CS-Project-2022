Heart failure surgery in Brazil. Heart failure is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Brazil as in other western countries. The authors review the experience with heart transplantation in the country based on 835 patients showing that the most frequent indication was idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy followed by ischemic and Chagas disease cardiomyopathy. Early mortality was higher than other series and differently from literature, age and gender had no influence in survival. Unexpectedly, Chagas disease had better results. In regard to palliative surgical procedures it is made an analysis of the results literature of cardiomyoplasty in Brazil and South America comparing with data from literature. Following, it is reviewed the experience with ventriculectomy, showing its benefits and limitations and finally, correction of mitral insufficiency in cardiomyopathy, through valvoplasty or replacement, is considered. In summary, it is shown that palliative procedures can lead to improvement of clinical condition and ventricular function but are limited by recurrence of heart failure or sudden death.
