The first 20 years of heart transplantation in Ireland. The first Irish heart transplant was performed on the 10th of September 1985. Over the next 20 years, 229 transplants were performed in 228 recipients. To evaluate the success of the first generation of cardiac transplantation in Ireland. Analysis of clinical outcomes and survival statistics for patients undergoing heart transplantation in Ireland and comparison with international standards. There has been a steady improvement in transplant outcome over this time and survival figures for recipients between 2000 and 2004 show a hospital, 1-year and 5-year survival rate of 85.7%, 84.1% and 76.8% respectively. Thirty-eight of the 99 heart transplants performed between 1985 and 1994 are still alive more than 10 years later and the longest survivor is now 19 years post transplantation. The results compare favourably with international figures. Heart transplantation offers excellent longterm survival and quality of life but remains challenged by a shortage of suitable donor organs.
