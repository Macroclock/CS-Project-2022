Angiographic, pathologic, and clinical relationships in coronary artery disease in cardiac allografts. To date, the etiologic factors involved in the development of allograft coronary disease remain speculative and the treatment uncertain. The purpose of this study was to review the relationship of clinical, angiographic, and pathologic features of cardiac allograft vascular disease in a large population of heart transplant recipients followed for up to 15 years. From 1981 to 1996, 789 angiograms from 255 cardiac allografts were reviewed to determine the prevalence and severity of coronary artery disease. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were analyzed to identify factors associated with the presence of angiographic coronary artery disease. In addition, pathologic examination was performed on many of the lost grafts. Unsuspected severe donor coronary artery disease may be responsible for up to 10% of early graft failures. Angiographic coronary artery disease prevalence increased by approximately 10% with every 2-year interval after transplantation. Angiographic coronary artery disease consisted most often of minor luminal irregularities. Severe disease occurred in 12% of patients. At 1 year, the most significant factors associated with the presence of coronary artery disease were older donor age and the number of rejection episodes. Immunologic factors as well as traditional coronary risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia and hyperglycemia may play an important role in the genesis and progression of later-developing abnormalities. Cardiac allograft coronary artery disease is a major limiting factor to the long-term success of cardiac transplantation. Immune processes, as well as traditional coronary artery disease risk factors, appear to play a role in the development of this disease.
