Mortality in status 2 patients listed for heart transplantation in the United States: Will understanding cause of death help justify implantation of left ventricular assist devices into less sick patients? It remains unclear whether left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation in non-inotrope dependent patients is of clinical benefit. This study sought to evaluate cause of death in patients listed for heart transplant (HT) to determine the relative risks and benefits of implanting LVAD into patients who are less sick than those included in the original clinical trials. We examined death as the primary outcome in 23,098 patients listed for HT from 2006 to 2014 using proportional subdistribution hazards modeling. Cause of death was examined as a secondary outcome using χ 1859 (8.1%) patients were removed from the wait list for death, including 229 (2.7%) status 1A, 349 (4.6%) status 1B, 246 (13.2%) status 2, and 1035 (26.0%) status 7 patients (P < 0.0001). Status 2 patients who received LVAD while listed had a higher risk of death compared to those who did not (adjusted HR 1.68; 95% CI 1.09-2.59; P = 0.02), while there was no increased risk of death in status 1A (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.68-1.51; P = 0.9) and status 1B (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.65-1.23; P = 0.5) who received LVAD. Status 2 patients who received LVAD were more likely to die cerebrovascular causes (0.6% vs. 0.1%, P = 0.009) and organ failure (70.6% vs. 29.4%, P = 0.003). LVAD implantation in status 2 patients listed for HT is associated with a higher risk of death. More research is needed to determine the impact LVAD implantation will have on mortality in patients with ambulatory, non-inotrope dependent HF.
