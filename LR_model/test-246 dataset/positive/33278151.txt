Heart transplantation candidacy. Timely referral of eligible candidates for consideration of advanced therapies, such as a heart transplantation or mechanical circulatory support is essential. The characteristics of heart transplantation candidates have changed significantly over the years, leading to a more complex evaluation process. The present review summarizes recent advances in the evaluation process for heart transplantation eligibility. The heart transplantation allocation policy was recently reviewed in the USA in an effort to reduce waitlist mortality and to ensure fair geographic allocation of organs to the sickest patients. Moreover, patients with chronic infectious diseases, as well as malignancies, are being currently considered acceptable candidates for transplantation. Listing practices for heart transplantation vary between programmes, with a greater willingness to consider high-risk candidates at higher-volume centres. The ultimate decision to place high-risk candidates on the heart transplantation waitlist should be based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative data analysis informed by clinical judgement, and the chronic shortage of organ donors makes this process an important ethical concern for any society. Future guidelines should discuss approaches to achieve fair organ allocation while preserving improved outcomes after transplantation.
