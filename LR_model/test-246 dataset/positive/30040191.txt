Association of pretransplant and posttransplant program ratings with candidate mortality after listing. The Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) is responsible for understandable reporting of program metrics, including transplant rate, waitlist mortality, and posttransplant outcomes. SRTR developed five-tier systems for each metric to improve accessibility for the public. We investigated the associations of the five-tier assignments at listing with all-cause candidate mortality after listing, for candidates listed July 12, 2011-June 16, 2014. Transplant rate evaluations with one additional tier were associated with lower mortality after listing in kidney (hazard ratio [HR],  'Scientific Registry for Transplant Recipients (SRTR)', 'health services and outcomes research', 'organ transplantation in general', 'statistics'
