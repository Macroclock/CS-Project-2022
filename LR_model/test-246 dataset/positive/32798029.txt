Outcomes after heart retransplantation: A 50-year single-center experience. To evaluate outcomes after heart retransplantation. From January 6, 1968, to June 2019, 123 patients (112 adult and 11 pediatric patients) underwent heart retransplantation, and 2092 received primary transplantation at our institution. Propensity-score matching was used to account for baseline differences between the retransplantation and the primary transplantation-only groups. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed. The primary end point was all-cause mortality, and secondary end points were postoperative complications. Retransplantation recipient age was 39.6 ± 16.4 years, and donor age was 26.4 ± 11.2 years. Ninety-two recipients (74.8%) were male. Compared with recipients who only underwent primary heart transplantation, retransplantation recipients were more likely to have hypertension (44/73.3% vs 774/53.3%, P = .0022), hyperlipidemia (40/66.7% vs 447/30.7%, P < .0001), and require dialysis (7/11.7% vs 42/2.9%, P = .0025). The indications for heart retransplantation were cardiac allograft vasculopathy (32/80%), primary graft dysfunction (6/15%), and refractory acute rejection (2/5%). After matching, postoperative outcomes such as hospital length of stay, severe primary graft dysfunction requiring intra-aortic balloon pump or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, cerebral vascular accident, respiratory failure, renal failure requiring dialysis, and infection were similar between the 2 groups. Matched median survival after retransplantation was 4.6 years compared with 6.5 years after primary heart transplantation (log-rank P = .36, stratified log-rank P = .0063). In this single-center cohort, the unadjusted long-term survival after heart retransplantation was inferior to that after primary heart transplantation, and short-term survival difference persisted after propensity-score matching. Heart retransplantation should be considered for select patients for optimal donor organ usage. 'heart retransplantation', 'heart transplantation', 'long-term', 'outcomes', 'survival'
