Optimal timing for heart transplantation in patients bridged with left ventricular assist devices: Is timing of the essence? Due to the scarcity of donor hearts to meet recipient demands, more than 40% of heart transplants are performed in patients bridged to transplant (BTT) with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). The objective of this study was to determine the effect of BTT duration with an LVAD on posttransplant outcomes. From 2009 to 2014, we identified 2639 fee-for-service Medicare patients who underwent a primary heart transplants with 1186 (45%) patients BTT with an LVAD. The LVAD patients were stratified as BTT ≤31 days (n = 28 [2.4%]), BTT 31-365 days (n = 748 [63.1%]), and BTT >365 days (n = 409 [34.5%]). Patients went directly to heart transplantation and were not bridged in 1453 cases (55%). LVAD duration was analyzed dichotomously and as a continuous variable with adjusted overall survival as the primary end point. All-cause mortality was significantly worse in patients who were BTT <31 days. Survival at 30 days was 81.5% for BTT <31 days, 94% for BTT 31 to 365 days, 95% for BTT >365 days, and 94% for no BTT. At 1 year, survival was 74% for BTT <31 days, 85% for BTT 31 to 365 days, 88% for BTT >365 days, and 89% for no BTT (P = .018). When LVAD duration was analyzed as a continuous variable, patients BTT with an LVAD <34 days had significantly increased mortality. Patients who underwent heart transplantation within the first month of BTT with an LVAD had significantly increased mortality. However, there was no survival difference among patients who were BTT with an LVAD longer than 31 days.
