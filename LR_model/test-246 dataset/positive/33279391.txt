The impact of frailty on mortality after heart transplantation. Frailty is prevalent in the patients with advanced heart failure; however, its impact on clinical outcomes after heart transplantation (HTx) is unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of pre-transplant frailty on mortality and the duration of hospitalization after HTx. We retrospectively reviewed the post-transplant outcomes of 140 patients with advanced heart failure who had undergone frailty assessment within the 6-month interval before HTx: 43 of them were frail (F) and 97 were non-frail (NF). Post-transplant survival rates for the NF cohort at 1 and 12 months were 97% (93-100) and 95% (91-99) (95% CI), respectively. In contrast, post-transplant survival rates for the F cohort at the same time points were 86% (76-96) and 74% (60-84) (p < 0.0008 vs NF cohort), respectively. The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated that pre-transplant frailty was an independent predictor of post-transplant mortality with a hazard ratio of 3.8 (95% CI: 1.4-10.5). Intensive care unit and hospital length of stay were 2 and 7 days longer in the F cohort (both p < 0.05), respectively, than in the NF cohort. Frailty within 6 months before HTx is independently associated with increased mortality and prolonged hospitalization after transplantation. Future research should focus on the development of strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of pre-transplant frailty.
