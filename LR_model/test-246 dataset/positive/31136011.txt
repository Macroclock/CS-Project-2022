Prediction of survival on the waiting list for heart transplantation and of posttransplant nonadherence-Results of a prospective longitudinal study. Only a few previous studies have focused on the interaction between pretransplant psychological variables, survival on the waiting list, and adherence to therapy after heart transplantation (HTx). This work combined two studies: Study 1 monitored survival of patients on a HTx waiting list (n = 50) and study 2 examined barriers to adherence after HTx (subgroup of n = 20). All patients were evaluated immediately after listing for HTx (T0). Those in study 2 were also evaluated immediately after HTx (T1) and after 6 months (T2). Psychosocial functioning was measured by the Transplant Evaluation Rating Scale (TERS), and depression and anxiety by Patient Health Questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Barriers to immunosuppressive adherence post-HTx were measured by the Medication Experience Scale for Immunosuppressants (MESI). According to the TERS classification of Rothenhäusler et al, patients were divided into three groups in study 1. Compared with inconspicuous patients (n = 23) and risk patients (n = 21), high-risk patients (n = 6) demonstrated a higher mortality (log-rank test of trend, P = 0.002). In study 2, there was a strong correlation between the TERS (T0) and the MESI (T2) (r = 0.84, P = 0.001). The TERS may serve as a predictor of survival on the waiting list. There is need for further longitudinal data with larger sample sizes.
