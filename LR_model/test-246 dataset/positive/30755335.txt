Pacemakers are associated with a higher risk of late death and transplantation in the Fontan population. The need for permanent pacing has been identified as a predictor of poor outcomes in the late survivors of Fontan surgery. However, it is not clear if the need for a pacemaker is a surrogate marker of a declining Fontan state, or if pacing is deleterious to the Fontan circulation. We sought to compare the long-term outcomes of propensity-matched Fontan patients with and without a permanent pacemaker. Patients who have survived Fontan completion with a documented history of cardiac arrhythmia were identified from the Australia and New Zealand Fontan Registry. Pacemaker insertion details, cardiac function and electrophysiological data were obtained for the patients with a permanent pacemaker. Survival analysis was performed with propensity score matching to compare late survival and outcomes in patients with versus without a pacemaker. There was a total of 310 patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmia, of which 126 (41%) had a permanent pacemaker. After propensity-score matching, 99 pairs were generated (n = 198). Patients with a permanent pacemaker had a higher risk of death (HR 3.32 95% CI 1.60-6.90, p = 0.001) and death or transplantation (HR 3.55 95% CI 1.87-6.73, p < 0.001). Patients who were only paced atrially were not at a significantly increased risk of death or transplantation. However, patients who were ventricular paced >50% of the time were much more likely to encounter late death or transplantation (HR 3.82 95% CI 1.64-8.95, p = 0.002). Having a permanent pacemaker and needing ventricular pacing is likely associated with an increased risk of death and transplantation in patients with a Fontan circulation.
