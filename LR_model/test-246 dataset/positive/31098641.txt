Establishing a heart transplant programme using donation after circulatory-determined death donors: a United Kingdom based single-centre experience. Demand for heart transplant donors worldwide continues to outstrip supply. Transplanting hearts following donation after circulatory-determined death (DCD) is increasingly recognized as a safe and effective alternative. As the fourth centre worldwide to have established such a programme, our goal was to present our initial experience. This was a single-centre retrospective observational study. All DCD hearts were retrieved using direct procurement and perfusion. Continuous normothermic perfusion of the procured heart was then established on the TransMedics® Organ Care System. The primary outcome of this study was the 30-day survival rate. Between May 2017 and December 2018, 8 DCD hearts were procured and 7 were subsequently implanted, including in 2 patients who had left ventricular assist devices explanted. During the same time period, 30 patients received donation after brainstem death heart transplants. Therefore, the DCD heart transplant programme led to a 23% increase in transplant activity. The median donation warm ischaemic time was 34 min [interquartile range (IQR) 31-39 min]. The median functional warm ischaemic time was 28 min (IQR 25-30 min). The median time spent by the organ on the Organ Care System was 263 min (IQR 242-296 min). The overall 30-day survival rate was 100% and the 90-day survival rate was 86%. Postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was required in 3/7 (43%). DCD heart transplants can lead to a 23% increase in heart transplant activity and should be adopted by more institutions across the world. Already established transplant programmes with good early outcomes can start such a programme safely.
