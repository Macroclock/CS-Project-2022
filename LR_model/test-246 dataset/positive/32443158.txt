Use of Organs for Heart Transplantation after Rescue Allocation: Comparison of Outcome with Regular Allocated High Urgent Recipients.  The number of patients waiting for heart transplantation (HTx) is exceeding the number of actual transplants. Subsequently, waiting times are increasing. One possible solution may be an increased acceptance of organs after rescue allocation. These organs had been rejected by at least three consecutive transplant centers due to medical reasons.  Between October 2010 and July 2019, a total of 139 patients underwent HTx in our department. Seventy (50.4%) of the 139 patients were transplanted with high urgency (HU) status and regular allocation (HU group); the remaining received organs without HU listing after rescue allocation (elective group,   Donor parameters were comparable between the groups. Thirty-day mortality was comparable between HU patients (11.4%) and rescue allocation (12.1%). Primary graft dysfunction with extracorporeal life support occurred in 26.9% of the elective group with rescue allocated organs, which was not inferior to the regular allocated organs (HU group: 35.7%). No significant differences were observed regarding the incidence of common perioperative complications as well as morbidity and mortality during 1-year follow-up.  Our data support the use of hearts after rescue allocation for elective transplantation of patients without HU status. We could show that patients with rescue allocated organs showed no significant disadvantages in the early perioperative morbidity and mortality as well at 1-year follow-up.
