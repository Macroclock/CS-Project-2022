Impact of durable ventricular assist devices on post-transplant outcomes in adults with congenital heart disease. There are no published data on post-transplant outcomes in durable ventricular assist device (VAD)-supported adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients. We compared post-transplant outcomes in VAD-supported vs non-VAD-supported ACHD patients using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. At 1 year, there was no difference in post-transplant mortality between VAD-supported (12 patients) and non-VAD-supported (671 patients) ACHD patients. In appropriate ACHD patients, VAD use as a bridge to transplant is a reasonable strategy. 'adult congenital heart disease', 'heart transplant', 'ventricular assist device'
