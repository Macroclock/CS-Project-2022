Risk Factors for Severe Primary Graft Dysfunction in Infants Following Heart Transplant. Background Previous studies suggest that infant heart transplant (HT) recipients are at higher risk of developing severe primary graft dysfunction (PGD) than older children. We sought to identify risk factors for developing severe PGD in infant HT recipients. Methods and Results We identified all HT recipients aged <1 year in the United States during 1996 to 2015 using the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network database. We linked their data to ELSO (Extracorporeal Life Support Organization) registry data to identify those with severe PGD, defined by initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for PGD within 2 days following HT. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess risk factors for developing severe PGD. Of 1718 infants analyzed, 600 (35%) were <90 days old and 1079 (63%) had congenital heart disease. Overall, 134 (7.8%) developed severe PGD; 95 (71%) were initiated on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support on the day of HT, 34 (25%) the next day, and 5 (4%) the following day. In adjusted analysis, recipient congenital heart disease, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or biventricular assist device support at transplant, recipient blood type AB, donor-recipient weight ratio <0.9, and graft ischemic time ≥4 hours were independently associated with developing severe PGD whereas left ventricular assist device support at HT was not. One-year graft survival was 48% in infants with severe PGD versus 87% without severe PGD. Conclusions Infant HT recipients with severe PGD have poor graft survival. Although some recipient-level risk factors are nonmodifiable, avoiding modifiable risk factors may mitigate further risk in infants at high risk of developing severe PGD.
