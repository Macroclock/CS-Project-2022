Center Donor Refusal Rate Is Associated With Worse Outcomes After Listing in Pediatric Heart Transplantation. Pediatric donor heart acceptability differs among transplant centers. However, the impact of center donor acceptance on waitlist and posttransplant outcomes has not been investigated. The aim of our study was to investigate associations between transplant center refusal rate (RR) and outcomes after listing. Retrospective analysis was performed using United Network for Organ Sharing/Organ Procurement and Transplant Network pediatric (<18 y) heart transplant data from 2007 to 2017. Center RR was defined as the median number of refusals per listed patient. Associations between RR center quartile and waitlist time, waitlist removal for death or clinical deterioration, posttransplant survival, and survival after listing were investigated. There were 5552 listed patients in 59 centers who met inclusion criteria. The lowest quartile RR centers had a median RR of ≤1 per listed patient, and highest RR centers percentile had a median RR of ≥4. Highest RR centers had shorter time to first offer (19 versus 38 d; P < 0.001), with longer waitlist times (203 versus 145 d; P < 0.001), were more likely to remove patients from the waitlist due to death or deterioration (24.1% versus 14.6%; P < 0.001), less likely to transplant listed patients (63.1% versus 77.6%; P < 0.001), and had a lower likelihood of survival 1 year after listing (79.2% versus 91.6%; odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.0; P < 0.001) compared with low RR centers. Patients listed at high RR centers had worse survival from listing despite having shorter times to first offer.
