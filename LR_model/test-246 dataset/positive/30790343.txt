Permanent pacemaker implantation after pediatric heart transplantation: Risk factors, indications, and outcomes. Permanent pacemaker (PPM) placement in adults following orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) has been well documented. However, studies concerning the need for PPM implantation in pediatric heart transplant recipients are less common. Institutional transplant and pacing databases as well as patient medical records were reviewed for all pediatric patients undergoing OHT (n = 314; all with bicaval connection) at our institution between January 2000 and March 2018. A total of 16 patients (5.1%) were implanted with a pacemaker after transplantation. Donor age was the only significant risk factor for post-transplant PPM implantation, with a median age of 28.5 years (7.0-49.0) in the pacing group vs 15.5 years (0.4-56.0) in the non-pacing group (P = 0.009). Indication for pacemaker insertion was more often complete heart block (CHB) (12/16, 75%) than sinus node dysfunction (SND) (4/16, 25%). There was no significant difference in mortality between recipients who received a PPM and those who did not (log-rank test; P = 0.345). Increasing donor age is associated with increased PPM placement following pediatric heart transplantation. Interestingly, a high proportion of CHB patients recovered sinus rhythm, and long-term outcomes for paced patients are similar to other heart transplant recipients.
