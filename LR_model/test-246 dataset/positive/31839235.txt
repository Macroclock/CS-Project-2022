The reality of limping to pediatric heart transplantation. Improvements in surgical technique, critical care, and early repair for congenital heart disease (CHD) have led to improved outcomes with heart transplantation, often used as a salvage procedure after failed palliation, especially in infants. These patients, however, often have several risk factors for poor posttransplant survival. We aimed to identify the reality of survival after heart transplantation in patients "limping to transplant" with common risk factors. All heart transplant recipients younger than 18Â years were identified from the UNOS data set from 2000 to 2017. Modifiable risk factors (MRFs) of mechanical ventilation, renal dysfunction, and liver dysfunction at transplant and nonmodifiable risk factors of infancy at listing or CHD were examined. One-year posttransplant survival was analyzed with logistic regression. Of 4101 transplants, 1459 patients (36%) had 1 or more MRFs. There was a decrease in 1-year survival with additional MRFs up to a 9.1-times increased risk of death in an infant with CHD. A noninfant without CHD and no MRFs had a 95% 1-year survival, in contrast to an intubated patient with CHD without other end-organ dysfunction, who had 1-year survival of 76%, which decreased to 58% if they were an infant and also had renal dysfunction. Patients "limping to transplant" with multiple risk factors demonstrates decreasing early survival relative to those without other end-organ dysfunction. It is imperative that we have transparent discussions about expected outcomes with these families and identify ways to optimize patients' conditions through other supportive avenues to improve posttransplant outcomes.
