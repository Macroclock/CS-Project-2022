Predicting Short- and Long-Term Outcomes in Adult Heart Transplantation: Clinical Utility of MELD-XI Score. Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scoring system excluding international normalized ratio (MELD-XI) has been related with worse outcomes after heart transplantation (HT). However, according to standards in prognostic models research, before implementing a risk score for daily clinical decision-making, its performance and impact on clinical practice/outcomes should be evaluated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of the MELD-XI score to predict outcomes in daily clinical practice. We retrospectively reviewed 190 consecutive adults undergoing HT between 2005-2015. Patients were stratified into low (MELD-XI <12) and high (MELD-XI ≥12) risk cohorts. Mortality rates at 30 days and 1 year were compared between MELD-XI groups. MELD-XI ability to predict 1-year mortality was assessed by the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and compared to that of bilirubin, creatinine, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Mortality rates at 30 days and 1 year were similar between groups (8% vs 13%; P = .28 and 21% vs 29%; P = .21, respectively). MELD-XI ability to predict 1-year mortality was poor and similar to that of bilirubin, creatinine, and PVR (0.51 vs 0.47 vs 0.50 vs 0.50, respectively). MELD-XI score utility in HT clinical decision-making is scarce since its discrimination ability is poor and similar to other simple prognostic variables.
