Predictors of renal replacement therapy after heart transplantation and its impact on long-term survival. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) after heart transplant (HT) is associated with worse prognosis. We aimed to identify predictors of RRT and the impact of this complication on long-term survival. Cohort study of HT patients. Univariate and multivariate competing-risk regression was performed to identify independent predictors of RRT. The cumulative incidence function was plotted for RRT. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare long-term survival. We included 103 patients. At multivariate analysis, only the emergency status of HT (short-term mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to transplant), chronic kidney disease, and low oxygen delivery were independent predictors of RRT (subhazard ratio [SHR] 4.11, 95% CI 1.84-9.14; SHR 3.17, 95% CI 1.29-7.77; SHR 2.86, 95% CI 1.14-7.19, respectively). Elective HT patients that required RRT showed a significantly reduced survival comparable to patients with emergency HT and RRT (75% ± 13% vs. 67% ± 16%). The absence of RRT implied an excellent survival in patients with an emergency status of HT and elective HT (100% vs. 93% ± 4%). The emergency status of HT, chronic kidney disease, and low oxygen delivery were independent predictors of RRT. The occurrence of RRT increases the risk of death in elective HT as much as in patients with an emergency status.
