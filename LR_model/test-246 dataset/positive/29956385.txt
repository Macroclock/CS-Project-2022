Duration of corticosteroid use and long-term outcomes after adult heart transplantation: A contemporary analysis of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Registry. Long-term corticosteroid (CS) maintenance remains an effective option for immunosuppression following heart transplantation. We used the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Registry to examine characteristics and long-term survival among heart transplant recipients with different duration of CS therapy. Primary adult heart recipients transplanted between 2000 and 2008 who survived at least 5 years were categorized into three groups according to CS use: early withdrawal (≤2 years) (EARLY D/C), late withdrawal (between 2 and 5 years) (LATE D/C), or long-term use (>5 years) (LONG-TERM). Recipient and donor characteristics, post-transplant morbidities, and mortality were compared among groups. Kaplan-Meier was used to estimate survival up to 10 years post-transplant. The study cohort included 8161 recipients (2043 in EARLY D/C; 2031 in LATE D/C; and 4087 in LONG-TERM). LONG-TERM use of CS decreased over time, from 60% in 2000 to 43% in 2008, while EARLY D/C increased from 19% to 33%, respectively. Survival at 10 years after transplant was lower among the LONG-TERM group (73% vs EARLY D/C 82% vs LATE D/C 80%; P < 0.0001). In this large multinational cohort, the practice of long-term CS maintenance was associated with lower long-term survival compared with shorter CS use.
