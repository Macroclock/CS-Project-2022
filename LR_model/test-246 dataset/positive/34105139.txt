Clinical outcomes of older adults listed for heart transplantation in the United States. To examine if older age (>70 years) should be a relative contraindication for heart transplantation, we evaluated the characteristics and outcomes of patients with age ≥70 years listed for heart transplantation; and whether post-transplantation survival was inferior to younger counterparts. Retrospective cohort analysis. The scientific registry of transplant recipients (SRTR). Adults (≥18 years) listed for heart transplantation in the SRTR between 2000 and 2018. Heart transplantation. Characteristics and outcomes were compared for adults ≥70 years and <70 years. We evaluated waitlist mortality and post-transplant 1-year and 5-year survivals. The study included 57,285 patients (age range 18-79 years) listed for heart transplantation; 1203 (2.1%) age ≥70 years. Of these, 37,135 patients underwent heart transplantation; 806 (2.2%) were age ≥70 years. Yearly listing of those age ≥70 years has consistently increased from 2.5% (n = 30) in 2000 to 11% (n = 132) in 2017 (p < 0.01). As compared with the age <70 years group, those ≥70 years had a similar risk of death while waiting (sub-hazard ratio [SHR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [HR] 0.68-1.08; p = 0.19) but were more likely to be transplanted (SHR 1.36, 95% CI 1.26-1.48; p < 0.01). Among the older patients, the overall post-transplant 1- and 5-year mortality rate was 10.4% and 19.2%, respectively. Older recipients had lower unadjusted survival compared with younger recipients (log-rank p = 0.03). However, after adjustment for relevant covariates, there was no significant difference in 5-year mortality between both groups (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91-1.254; p = 0.43). Post-transplant survival up to 5 years among patients of age ≥70 years was similar to that of younger recipients. Older patients who received heart transplantation appear to have lower risk features but receive hearts from higher risk donors. Chronologic age alone should not constitute a contraindication for heart transplantation, although careful patient selection criteria should be applied.
