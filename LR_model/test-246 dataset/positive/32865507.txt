Outcomes of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Cardiac Transplant Patients: A Binational Analysis Derived From the United Kingdom and United States. To compare and contrast the indications, clinical and procedural characteristics, and periprocedural outcomes of patients with cardiac transplant undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the United States and United Kingdom. The British Cardiovascular Intervention Society Registry (BCIS) (2007-2014) and the United States National Inpatient Sample (NIS) (2004-2014) data were utilized for this analysis. There were 466 PCIs (0.09%) and 1122 PCIs (0.02%) performed in cardiac transplant patients in the BCIS and NIS registries, respectively. The cardiac transplant PCI cohort was younger and mostly men, with an increased prevalence of chronic kidney disease, left main PCI, and multivessel disease, and with lower use of newer antiplatelets agents, antithrombotics, and radial artery access vs the non-cardiac transplant PCI cohort. In the BCIS registry, the cardiac transplant PCI cohort had similar in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.05; P=.91), 30-day mortality (OR, 1.38; P=.31), vascular complications (OR, 0.69; P=.46), and major adverse cardiovascular event (OR, 1.41; P=.26) vs the non-cardiac transplant PCI cohort. However, the cardiac transplant group had higher 1-year mortality (OR, 2.30; P<.001). The NIS data analysis revealed similar rates of in-hospital mortality (OR, 2.40; P=.14), cardiac complications (OR, 0.26; P=.17), major bleeding (OR, 0.36; P=.16), vascular complications (OR, 0.46; P=.45), and stroke (OR, 0.50; P=.40) in the cardiac transplant PCI cohort vs the non-cardiac transplant PCI cohort. PCI in cardiac transplant recipients was associated with similar short-term mortality and vascular complications compared with PCI in the general populace. However, a higher 1-year morality was observed in the BCIS cohort. 'heart transplantation', 'percutaneous coronary intervention'
