Practice Variation, Costs and Outcomes Associated with the Use of Inhaled Nitric Oxide in Pediatric Heart Transplant Recipients. Right ventricular (RV) failure is a potentially fatal complication following heart transplantation (HTx). Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a selective pulmonary vasodilator that is used to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance immediately post-HTx to reduce the risk of RV failure. The aim of this study was to describe utilization patterns, costs, and outcomes associated with post-transplant iNO use in children. All pediatric HTx recipients (2002-2016) were identified from a unique linked PHIS/SRTR dataset. Post-HTx iNO use was determined based on hospital billing data. Utilization patterns and associated costs were described. The association of iNO support with post-HTx survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to adjust for risk factors. A total of 2833 pediatric HTx recipients from 28 centers were identified with 1057 (36.5%) receiving iNO post-HTx. Post-HTx iNO use showed significant increase overall (17.2-54.7%, p < 0.001) and wide variation among centers (9-100%, p < 0.001). Patients with congenital heart disease (aOR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2, 1.6), requiring mechanical ventilation at HTx (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1, 1.6), and pre-transplant iNO (aOR 9.3, 95% CI 5.4, 16) were more likely to receive iNO post-HTx. The median daily cost of iNO was $2617 (IQR $1843-$3646). Patients who required > 5 days of iNO post-HTx demonstrated inferior 1-year post-HTx survival (p < 0.001) and iNO use > 5 days was independently associated with worse post-HTx survival (AHR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2, 2.1; p < 0.001). There is wide variation in iNO use among centers following pediatric HTx with use increasing over time despite significant incremental cost. Prolonged iNO use post-HTx is associated with worse survival, likely serving as a marker of residual illness severity. Further research is needed to define the populations that derive the greatest benefit from this costly therapy. 'Child', 'Heart failure', 'Heart transplantation', 'Nitric oxide', 'Vasodilator agents'
