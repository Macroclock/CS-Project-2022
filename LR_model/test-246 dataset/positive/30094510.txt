Heart Transplantation and Mechanical Circulatory Support in Adults with Congenital Heart Disease. To assess current management strategies for advanced heart failure in adults with congenital heart disease, including heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support. Current data demonstrate that adults with CHD generally experience higher short-term mortality after heart transplantation and MCS implantation, but enjoy superior long-term survival. Such patients are nonetheless less likely to receive a transplant than non-ACHD peers due to a variety of factors, including lack of applicability of current listing criteria to HF in ACHD. MCS is underutilized in ACHD, but provides similar quality of life benefits for ACHD and non-ACHD patients alike. Heart failure in ACHD is complex and difficult to treat, and both heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support are often challenging to implement in this patient population. However, long-term results are encouraging, and existing data supports increasing use of MCS and transplant earlier in their disease course. Multidisciplinary care is critical to success in these complex patients. 'Adult congenital heart disease', 'Failing Fontan', 'Heart transplantation', 'LVAD', 'Mechanical circulatory support'
