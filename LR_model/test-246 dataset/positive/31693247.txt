Continuous-flow mechanical circulatory support is not associated with early graft failure: An analysis of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation registry. Continuous-flow mechanical circulatory support (CF-MCS) is associated with impaired vascular function and increased risk of vasoplegia. One contributing factor to early graft failure (EGF) is severe vasoplegia. We tested the hypothesis that CF-MCS is associated with increased risk of EGF. Adult primary heart transplant recipients in the ISHLT Registry from 2005 to 2013 were stratified into three groups based on pre-transplant MCS: No MCS (n = 11 748), pulsatile (P)-MCS (n = 718), and CF-MCS (n = 3818). EGF was defined as death/retransplantation due to graft failure within 30 days after HT. Comparisons were made using descriptive statistics and associations. EGF was assessed with multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression. The incidence of EGF within 30 days was similar between groups (No MCS 2.2%, P-MCS 3.3%, CF-MCS 2.1%, P = .10). Following multivariable adjustment, the risk of EGF was not statistically different for those with CF-MCS compared with P-MCS (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.46-1.21, P = .24). The risk of EGF was numerically, but not statistically significantly higher for CF-MCS compared with No MCS (HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.92-1.67, P = .16). CF-MCS use was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of EGF resulting in death or retransplantation in the first 30 days after transplant.
