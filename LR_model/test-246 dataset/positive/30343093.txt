Serial Assessment of Coronary Flow Reserve by Rubidium-82 Positron Emission Tomography Predicts Mortality in Heart Transplant Recipients. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term prognostic value of serial assessment of coronary flow reserve (CFR) by rubidium Rb 82 ( Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is a major determinant of late mortality in HT recipients. The long-term prognostic value of serial CFR quantification by PET imaging in HT patients is unknown. A total of 89 patients with history of HT (71% men, 7.0 ± 5.7 years post-HT, age 57 ± 11 years) scheduled for dynamic rest and stress (dipyridamole)  Forty deaths occurred during the median follow-up time of 8.6 years. Low CFR at PET-1 was associated with a 2.77-fold increase in all-cause mortality (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.34 to 5.74; p = 0.004). CFR decreased over time in patients with follow-up imaging (PET-1: 2.11 ± 0.74 vs. PET-2: 1.81 ± 0.61; p = 0.003). Twenty-five patients were reclassified based on PET-1 and PET-2 (high to low CFR: n = 18, low to high CFR: n = 7). Overall survival was similar in patients reclassified from high to low as patients with low to low CFR, whereas patients reclassified from low to high had similar survival as patients with high to high CFR. In multivariate Cox regression of patients with PET-2, higher baseline CFR (hazard ratio [HR] for a 0.73 unit (one SD) increase: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.82) and reduction in CFR from PET-1 to PET-2 (HR for a 0.79 unit (one SD) decrease: 1.50 to 7.84) were independent predictors of all-cause mortality.
