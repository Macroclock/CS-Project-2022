Early changes in cell-free DNA levels in newly transplanted heart transplant patients. Heart transplantation is a well-established therapy for end-stage heart failure in children and young adults. The highest risk of graft loss occurs in the first 60 days post-transplant. Donor fraction of cell-free DNA is a highly sensitive marker of graft injury. Changes in cell-free DNA levels have not previously been studied in depth in patients early after heart transplant. A prospective study was conducted among heart transplant recipients at a single pediatric heart center. Blood samples were collected from children and young adult transplant patients at three time points within 10 days of transplantation. DF and total cell-free DNA levels were measured using a targeted method (myTAI 'biomarkers', 'cell-free DNA', 'early postoperative period', 'pediatric heart transplant'
