Red Blood Cell Distribution Width in End-Stage Heart Failure Patients Is Independently Associated With All-Cause Mortality After Orthotopic Heart Transplantation. Red blood cell markers (RBCM) have been found to be predictors of mortality in various populations. However, there is no information regarding the association between the values of RBCM and long-term outcomes after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). The aim of this study was to assess whether the values of inflammatory markers and RBCM obtained directly before OHT are associated with mortality in patients diagnosed as having end-stage heart failure undergoing OHT. We retrospectively analyzed data of 173 nonanemic adult patients diagnosed as having end-stage heart failure undergoing primary OHT between 2007 and 2014. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained at the time of admission for the OHT. RBCM were analyzed using an automated blood counter (Sysmex XS-1000i and XE-2100, Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan). Mean age of the patients was 54 (41-59) and 72% of them were male. During the observation period, the mortality rate was 32%. Multivariable analysis of Cox proportional hazard confirmed that elevated pretransplantation red blood cell distribution width value (hazard ratio [HR], 1.38 [1.25-1.48], P < .001) was the sole independent predictor of death during long-term follow-up. Other red blood cell distribution width such as mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (HR, 0.88 [0.84-0.91]; P < .001; HR, 0.75 [0.53-1.05]; P < .05; HR, 0.78 [0.64-0.96]; P < .05, respectively) had predictive value in univariable analysis. In summary, we have demonstrated that elevated red blood cell distribution width immediately before OHT is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in heart transplant recipients. Other factors associated with posttransplantation mortality include lower values of mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration.
