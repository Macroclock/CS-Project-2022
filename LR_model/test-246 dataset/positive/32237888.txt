Practice Patterns Surrounding Pregnancy After Heart Transplantation. Pregnancy after heart transplantation (HT) is a concern for many female recipients. The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation has guidelines regarding reproductive health, but limited data exist regarding providers' attitudes and practices surrounding pregnancy post-HT. We conducted an independent, confidential, voluntary, web-based survey sent electronically to 1643 United States heart transplant providers between June and August 2019. There were 122 responses, the majority from cardiologists (n=85, 70%) and nurse or transplant coordinators (n=22, 18%). Thirty-one percent (n=37) of respondents indicated that pregnancy should be avoided in all HT recipients, and only 43% (n=52) reported that their center had a formal policy regarding pregnancy following HT. The most commonly reported contraindications included nonadherence (n=109, 89%), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (n=104, 85%), coronary allograft vasculopathy (n=86, 70%), prior rejection (n=76, 62%), presence of donor-specific antibodies (n=69, 57%), and prior peripartum cardiomyopathy pretransplant (n=57, 47%). Respondent sex, specialty, transplant volume, or prior experience with pregnancy after HT were not associated with recommendations to avoid posttransplant pregnancy. Transplant providers' attitudes regarding posttransplant pregnancy vary widely. Despite International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines, a significant proportion indicates that pregnancy is contraindicated in all recipients and the majority of programs have no center-specific policy to manage such pregnancies. While the low response rate limits the generalizability of the findings, they do suggest that education on the feasibility of pregnancy post-HT is indicated as many recipients are of, or survive to, childbearing age.
