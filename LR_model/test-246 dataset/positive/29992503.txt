Complications of Cardiac Transplantation. Despite the improvement in medical therapy for heart failure and the advancements in mechanical circulatory support, heart transplantation (HT) still remains the best therapeutic option to improve survival and quality of life in patients with advanced heart failure. Nevertheless, HT recipients are exposed to the risk of several potential complications that may impair their outcomes. In this article, we aim to provide a practical and scholarly framework for clinicians approaching heart transplant medicine, as well as a concise update for the experienced readers on the most relevant post-HT complications. While recognizing that most of the treatments herein discussed are based more on experience than on solid scientific evidence, significant step forward has been made in particular in the recognition and management of primary graft dysfunction, antibody-mediated rejection, and renal dysfunction. Complications after HT may vary according to the time from surgery and can be related to graft function and pathology or to diseases and dysfunctions occurring in other organs or systems, mainly as side effects of immunosuppressive drugs and progression of pre-existing conditions. Future research needs to focus on improving precision diagnostics of causes of graft dysfunction and on reaching an optimal and customized balance between efficacy and toxicities of immunosuppressive strategies.
