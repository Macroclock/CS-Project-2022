ABO-identical matching has no superiority in long-term survival in comparison to ABO-compatible matching in lung transplantation. Even though identical blood group matching between recipient and donor is preferred, it is still not clear by how much this improves the outcome for patients who received a lung transplant (LTx), or whether there is any survival benefit. Earlier studies have yielded ambiguous results and few have investigated long-term survival. The aim of this study is, therefore, to explore the different outcomes of identical and compatible recipient and donor blood group matching to determine whether identical matching is superior (LTx). Between January 1990 to June 2016, 297 patients underwent primary LTx, 10 patients underwent heart and lung transplantation (HLTx), and 18 patients required re-transplantation (Re-LTx) at Skåne University Hospital in Lund. With a total of 325 transplantations at our center, 262 were ABO-identically matched while 53 were ABO-compatible. For survival analyses, the end-point used was retransplantation-free survival in addition to excluding HLTx (n = 10), assessed by Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier. ABO-compatible patients had a median of 49 days (2-641), and ABO-identical patients had a median of 89 days (1-1717) (p = 0.048) on the transplant waiting list. Patients with a limited survival up to 1-year showed significant difference in survival rate for ABO-compatible recipients compared to ABO-identical recipients (p < 0.05), however no significant difference was shown in overall survival between the two groups (p > 0.05), with the same pattern shown in patients with a limited survival rate up to ten years, emphysema-patients, when excluding single-LTx and patients transplanted before 2005 and after 2005, respectively (p > 0.05). Recipients who received ABO-compatible matched grafts showed a similar survival rate to recipients who received ABO-identical matched grafts in the present study. Cytolomegalovirus and Ebstein Barr Virus mismatch were also identified as risk factors particular among emphysema patients. Since ABO-identical transplantations and ABO-compatible transplantations showed similar results, the present selection-bias of preferring ABO-identical lungs could be adjusted to increase organ allocation. It might also be possible to shorten recipient waiting list time, as an identical match showed over 80% higher time on the waiting list than a compatible, non-identical match.
