The effects of donor-specific antibody characteristics on cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) causes late graft dysfunction and post-transplant mortality. Currently, the effects of different donor-specific antibodies (DSA) on the severity of CAV remain unclear. We evaluated 526 adult heart transplant recipients at a single center between January 2010 and August 2015. Subjects were divided into those with DSA (n = 142) and those without DSA (n = 384, control). The DSA group was stratified into persistent DSA (n = 34), transient DSA (n = 105), 1:8 dilution DSA (n = 45), complement-binding (C1q) DSA (n = 36), Class I DSA (n = 37), and Class II DSA (n = 105). The primary outcome was the incidence of moderate-to-severe CAV (CAV 2/3) at 5-year follow-up. Subjects with persistent DSA, 1:8 dilution DSA, and C1q DSA had higher incidence of CAV 2/3 compared the control group (17.6%, 13.3%, and 16.7% vs. 3.1%, respectively; Pâ‰¤ .001). The incidence of CAV 2/3 between subjects with transient DSA and the control group was similar (2.8% vs. 3.1%; P = .888). Subjects with Class II DSA also had higher incidence of CAV 2/3 (7.6% vs. 3.1%; P = .039). DSA that are persistent, 1:8 dilution positive, C1q positive, and Class II are associated with more severe grades of CAV. These DSA characteristics may prognosticate disease and warrant consideration for treatment. 'alloantibody', 'coronary artery disease', 'heart (allograft) function/dysfunction'
