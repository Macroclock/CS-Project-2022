Heart transplantation outcomes in cardiac sarcoidosis. Cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) is a progressive inflammatory cardiomyopathy that can lead to heart failure, arrhythmia, and death. There is limited data on Orthotopic Heart Transplantation (OHT) outcomes in patients with CS. Here we examine outcomes in patients with CS who have undergone OHT at centers throughout the United States from 1987 to 2019. This was an analysis of 63,947 adult patients undergoing OHT captured in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry. Patients were characterized as cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) or Non-CS. Baseline characteristics were compared using chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis Tests. Outcomes of interest included primary graft failure, patient survival, treated graft rejection, hospitalization for infection, and post-transplant malignancy. During the study period 227 patients with CS underwent OHT. Patients with CS were younger, had higher proportion of non-white patients, and received transplants at more urgent statuses. After multivariable modeling there was no difference in survival (HR 0.86, CI 0.59-1.3, p = 0.446) or graft failure (HR 0.849, CI 0.58-1.23, p = 0.394) between patients with CS and Non-CS. Patients with CS had lower odds of rejection (OR 0.558, CI 0.315- 0.985, p = 0.0444). Patients with CS had similar odds of hospitalization for infection and post-transplant malignancy, as Non-CS patients. Patients with CS and Non-CS had similar post OHT survival, odds of graft failure, hospitalizations for infection, and post-transplant malignancy. Results of this study confirm the role of heart transplantation as a viable option for patients with CS. 'cardiac sarcoidosis', 'cardiac transplant', 'orthotopic heart transplant.', 'sarcoidosis'
