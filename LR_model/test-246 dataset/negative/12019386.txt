Single fibers of skeletal muscle as a novel graft for cell transplantation to the heart. Skeletal myoblast transplantation is a promising alternative to treat heart failure. A single fiber, the minimal functional unit of skeletal muscle, retains skeletal myoblasts beneath the basal lamina. When surrounding muscle is injured, myoblasts migrate from the fiber into the damaged area to regenerate muscle. We hypothesized that such isolated fibers could be used as an efficient vehicle to deliver myoblasts into damaged myocardium, resulting in improved cardiac function. Living single fibers of rat skeletal muscle were isolated, and their behavior was characterized in vitro. Single fibers were injected into the myocardium (at 4 sites, each receiving a single fiber) of rats in 2 models of heart failure induced either by means of doxorubicin administration or left coronary artery occlusion. Skeletal myoblasts dissociated from an isolated single fiber, proliferated, and differentiated into multinucleated myotubes in vitro. Within 3 days after grafting in vivo, original fibers provided putative myoblasts and disappeared. At 4 weeks, discrete loci consisting of several multinucleated myotubes were observed. Furthermore, single-fiber transplantation significantly improved cardiac function compared with the control treatment in either doxorubicin-treated hearts (maximum dP/dt, 4013.9 +/- 96.1 vs 3603.1 +/- 102.3 mm Hg/s; minimum dP/dt, -2313.7 +/- 75.1 vs. -2057.1 +/- 52.4 mm Hg/s) or ischemic hearts (maximum dP/dt, 3905.6 +/- 103.0 vs 3572.6 +/- 109.7 mm Hg/s; minimum dP/dt, -2336.1 +/- 69.7 vs -2106.4 +/- 74.2 mm Hg/s). Single-fiber transplantation acts as a vehicle for delivering putative skeletal myoblasts that appear to differentiate into myotubes within the myocardium. This was associated with improved function of failing hearts, suggesting its efficacy as a novel graft for cellular cardiomyoplasty.
