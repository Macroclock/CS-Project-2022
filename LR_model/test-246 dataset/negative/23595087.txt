DuraHeart™ magnetically levitated left ventricular assist device: Osaka University experience. The DuraHeart left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is the world's first approved magnetically levitated implantable centrifugal pump. We report our initial experience with the DuraHeart as a bridge to heart transplantation. Between 2008 and 2011, 23 patients (17 males; mean age 35 years, range 16-53 years) with endstage heart failure underwent implantation with the DuraHeart LVAD at Osaka University Hospital. Of those, 7 underwent conversion surgery from a Nipro paracorporeal LVAD to the DuraHeart. There were no deaths during the mean support period of 559±241 days (176-999 days). In total, 17 patients (74%) remain with the LVAD and 5 (22%) underwent heart transplantation after 580±302 days (176-982 days) of support. Major adverse events included 8 (34%) driveline/pocket infections, 4 (17%) cerebrovascular accidents, 4 (17%) right heart failures requiring mechanical support, and 3 (13%) mechanical device failures (magnetic levitation failure caused by driveline fracture). Of the 5 patients who developed pump pocket infection, 3 underwent previous conversion surgery from the Nipro LVAD. Our initial experience with the DuraHeart LVAD in Japan demonstrated excellent long-term survival with acceptable rates of adverse events. With refinement of the system, including mechanical durability, this pump will further enhance the quality of life for patients who require long-term mechanical circulatory support.
