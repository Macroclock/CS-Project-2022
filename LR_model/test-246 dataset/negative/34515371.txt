Association of donor hypertension and outcomes in orthotopic heart transplantation. The present study examined the impact of donor hypertension on recipient survival and offer acceptance practices in the United States. This was a retrospective study of all patients undergoing OHT from 1995 to 2019 using the United Network for Organ Sharing and Potential Transplant Recipient file databases. Hypertensive donors were stratified by Short (0-5 years) and Prolonged (> 5 years) hypertension. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze offer acceptance practices while Cox proportional-hazards models were used to compare mortality across groups. Of 38,338 heart transplants meeting study criteria, 5662 were procured from hypertensive donors (69% Short and 31% Prolonged). After adjustment, Prolonged donor hypertension was associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, HR, 1.31, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.04-1.64), while recipients of Short donors experienced no decrement in post-transplant survival. Both Short and Prolonged hypertension were independently associated with decreased odds of offer acceptance (odds ratio, OR .92 95%CI: .88-.96 and OR .93 95%CI: .88-.99, respectively). While prolonged untreated hypertension in OHT donors is associated with a slight decrement in recipient survival, donors with ≤5 years of hypertension yielded similar outcomes. Donor hypertension was associated with reduced organ offer acceptance, highlighting a potential source of organ underutilization.
