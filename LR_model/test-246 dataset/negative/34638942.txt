Interferons Are Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines in Sheared-Stressed Human Aortic Valve Endothelial Cells. Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is an athero-inflammatory process. Growing evidence supports the inflammation-driven calcification model, mediated by cytokines such as interferons (IFNs) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Our goal was investigating IFNs' effects in human aortic valve endothelial cells (VEC) and the potential differences between aortic (aVEC) and ventricular (vVEC) side cells. The endothelial phenotype was analyzed by Western blot, qPCR, ELISA, monocyte adhesion, and migration assays. In mixed VEC populations, IFNs promoted the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription-1 and nuclear factor-κB, and the subsequent up-regulation of pro-inflammatory molecules. Side-specific VEC were activated with IFN-γ and TNF-α in an orbital shaker flow system. TNF-α, but not IFN-γ, induced hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α stabilization or endothelial nitric oxide synthase downregulation. Additionally, IFN-γ inhibited TNF-α-induced migration of aVEC. Also, IFN-γ triggered cytokine secretion and adhesion molecule expression in aVEC and vVEC. Finally, aVEC were more prone to cytokine-mediated monocyte adhesion under multiaxial flow conditions as compared with uniaxial flow. In conclusion, IFNs promote inflammation and reduce TNF-α-mediated migration in human VEC. Moreover, monocyte adhesion was higher in inflamed aVEC sheared under multiaxial flow, which may be relevant to understanding the initial stages of CAVD.
