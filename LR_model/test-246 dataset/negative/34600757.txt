Complications After Heart Transplantation According to the Type of Pretransplant Circulatory/Ventricular Support. The purpose of the study was to analyze postcardiac transplant complications in patients who received transplants with short-term mechanical ventricular assist devices and to compare complications according to the type of device. Ambispective and consecutive study of urgent heart transplants from 2015 to 2019. Pediatric transplants, retransplants, and combined transplants were excluded. A total of 45 patients were analyzed in 4 groups: (1) venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) implanted <10 days before heart transplant (HTx) (n = 17); (2) ECMO implanted for more than 10 days (n = 8); (3) Levitronix Centrimag implanted in INTERMACS 2 to 3 patients (n = 13); and (4) Levitronix Centrimag implanted in INTERMACS 2 patients (n = 7). ECMO assistance was in INTERMACS 2 and severe right ventricular dysfunction. Levitronix Centrimag was implanted in patients with preserved right ventricular function. Primary graft failure associated with the need for ECMO was more frequent in patients with ECMO than with Levitronix (P < .05). When comparing the 2 groups with ECMO, an implant more than 10 days before HTx was associated, after transplant, with a longer stay in the critical care unit (P = .02), higher mortality (P = .03), and an increase in complications in general. When comparing the 2 groups with Levitronix, all the parameters studied were much better when the Levitronix was implanted in INTERMACS 2-3 (P < .05). On the other hand, all cases of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism occurred in patients who were assisted with ECMO. HTx with mechanical assist devices is associated with significant complications. ECMO produces more complications than the Levitronix Centrimag, although they are related to the days of implantation. The best group are patients implanted with a Levitronix in INTERMACS 2-3.
