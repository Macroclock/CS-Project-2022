Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for primary chylopericardium after orthotopic heart transplantation. Chylopericardium is a rare complication of cardiac surgical procedures. We describe a 41-year-old woman who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation and developed chylopericardium early in the post-operative period. Because of unsuccessful conservative treatment (pericardiocentesis, pericardial drainage, low-fat diet with medium-chain triglycerides, and total parenteral nutrition), surgical intervention was indicated and the patient successfully underwent right-sided thoracoscopic duct ligation and partial pericardiectomy (pericardial window).
