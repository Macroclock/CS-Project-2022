Cardiac Extracellular Matrix as a Platform for Heart Organ Bioengineering: Design and Development of Tissue-Engineered Heart. The field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is able to depict the mechanism of cardiac repair and development of cardiac function as well, in order to reveal findings to new therapeutic designs for clinical treatment. The foremost approach of this scientific field is the fabrication of scaffolds, which contain cells that can be used as cardiac grafts in the body, to have the preferred recovery. Cardiac tissue engineering has not been completely organized for routine clinical usages. Hence, engineering innovations hold promise to character research and treatment options in the years to come. Our group has extensive experience with regard to the structure of the heart, which makes us to our decision to continue with the preparation of heart, with the aim of developing a new ECM scaffold. Herein, we aim to assess the state-of-the-art fabrication methods, advances in decellularization and recellularization techniques. We also highlight the major achievements toward the production of a bioengineered heart obtained from decellularization and recellularization techniques.
