Bone mineral density in pediatric heart transplanted patients: A retrospective single-center study at Skåne University Hospital in Lund 1988-2016. Impaired bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis are commonly found in patients who have undergone heart transplantation (HT), which increases the risk for bone fractures which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in adults. However, the long-term evolution of BMD after HT in pediatric patients has not been thoroughly investigated. Bone mineral density up to 10 years after HT was investigated in 30 patients who underwent HT at an age <20 years at Skåne University Hospital in Lund 1988-2016. The total observed time was 235 person-years. Before HT, 86% had low BMD for chronologic age in the lumbar spine. In lumbar spine, BMD was significantly lower than normal for chronological age before HT (p = .034), but recovered at the 4th year (p = .009). In whole body, BMD was normal at the 4th annual check-up (p = .030) and remained so throughout the follow-up period. The median T score in the lumbar spine and femoral neck 10 years after HT did not differ between the two groups based on age at HT (<20 years vs 20 years or older; p = .779 in the lumbar spine and p = .388 in the femoral neck). Patients who undergo HT at an age of <20 years have low BMD for chronological age already before HT, but BMD may recover completely within the first 4 years after HT. The results indicate no difference in BMD at 10 years after HT between pediatric and adult patients. 'bone mineral density', 'heart transplantation', 'immunosuppression', 'pediatric'
