Multistage Endovascular Management of a Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysm in a Post-Heart Transplant Patient. The development of aneurysms of thoracoabdominal aorta (TAAA) in a post-transplant patient is a rare clinical situation and requires special attention. Endovascular treatment is the most suitable option for these patients due to numerous comorbidities. Particular emphasis should be placed on the ejection fraction as one of the main criteria for qualifying for surgery. The treatment itself remains a major challenge relating to anatomical constrains; however, it is possible in select patients in experienced centers.
