Physical performance after pediatric solid organ transplantation. Low physical activity is a well-recognized problem in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients; however, little is known about the differences between transplant groups. Physical performance testing was performed in a cohort of pediatric kidney, liver, and heart transplant recipients. Fifty-one patients (54.9% boys), including 17 liver, 20 kidney, 2 combined liver-kidney, and 12 heart transplant recipients, were tested at the median age of 11.5 (7.5-14.9) years. The results were compared with a control group, which consisted of 425 healthy schoolchildren. The physical performance test included six different tests of endurance, strength, flexibility, and speed. The transplant recipients performed worse on most tests when compared with the control subjects (leg-lift test 42.0 vs. 44.9 repetitions, p = .002; repeated squatting 21.6 vs. 23.9 repetitions, p < .001; sit-up test 9 vs. 17 vs. 9 repetitions, p < .001, back extension 20 vs. 35 repetitions, p < .001; and shuttle run test 26.5 vs. 23.7 seconds, p < .001). None of the test results differed statistically significantly between the transplant groups. The physical performance of pediatric solid organ transplant recipients is lower than that of their healthy peers but do not differ between different transplant groups. More systematic rehabilitation programs and follow-up are needed. 'heart transplant', 'kidney transplant', 'liver transplant', 'pediatric solid organ transplantation', 'physical performance'
