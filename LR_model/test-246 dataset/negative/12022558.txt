Endothelial cell injury induced by preservation solutions: a confocal microscopy study. We evaluated the effects of standard preservation solutions on cultured human greater saphenous vein endothelial cells. Endothelial cells (eight strains) were preincubated for 6 or 24 hours at 4 degrees C in Celsior, Euro-Collins, St. Thomas Hospital II, and University of Wisconsin solutions, reincubated in warm oxygenated culture medium 199, and observed up to 48 hours. Culture viability was assessed through cell counting and confocal microscopy of calcein loaded cells. Incubation in both Euro-Collins and St. Thomas, but not in Celsior or University of Wisconsin solutions, caused significant cells losses and diffuse morphological damages characterized by solution-specific distinctive alterations. Injury caused by 6-hour, but not by 24-hour treatment, was reversible. The incubation with Celsior and University of Wisconsin solutions substantially preserved endothelial viability and proliferative capability. Conversely, a prolonged incubation in either Euro-Collins or St. Thomas solutions caused severe and potentially irreversible damage referable to the induction of, respectively, apoptotic or necrotic changes.
