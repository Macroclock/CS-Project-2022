Functional roles of graft-infiltrating lymphocytes during early-phase post-transplantation in mouse cardiac transplantation models. Immunological behavior of graft-infiltrating lymphocytes (GILs) determines the graft fate (i.e., rejection or acceptance). Nevertheless, the functional alloreactivity and the phenotype of GILs at various times during the early post-transplantation phase have not been fully elucidated. We examined the immunological activities of early-phase GILs using a murine model of cardiac transplantation. GILs from 120-h allografts, but not 72-h allografts, showed robust activation and produced proinflammatory cytokines. In particular, a significant increase in CD69 'antigen specificity', 'graft-infiltrating lymphocytes', 'homeostatic proliferation', 'mouse cardiac transplantation models'
