Chemokines in transplant rejection. Recent studies in transplant biology have demonstrated a role for chemokines in the migration of leukocytes into transplanted tissue. There is further evidence that modulation of the action of chemokines at their receptors can improve the outcome of acute rejection as well as long-term graft survival. A number of clinical therapies, based on both small molecules and biologicals, are currently under investigation with the potential for selective immunosupression. This article discusses the chemokines and receptors identified as the best characterized molecular targets, as well as the therapies under investigation for these targets.
