Contemporary outcomes of durable ventricular assist devices in adults with congenital heart disease as a bridge to heart transplantation. This study aimed to compare the clinical characteristics, risk factors, and overall survival outcomes in adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) bridged to transplantation with a ventricular assist device (VAD) versus no-VAD. The study included 894 ACHD patients aged ≥18 years listed for primary heart transplantation between 2010 and 2019 from the United Network for Organ Sharing database. Primary outcomes were waitlist and 1-year post-transplant mortality between VAD and no-VAD ACHD patients. Of 894 ACHD patients included in the study, 91(10.1%) had VAD support at the time of listing. Patients who needed VAD support were mostly males, heavier, and had higher pulmonary artery pressure than the no-VAD group at the listing. The overall waitlist mortality was 38% in the VAD group than 17% in the no-VAD group (p < 0.01). ECMO use was associated with significantly higher mortality than either group. There was no significant difference in 1-year post-transplant mortality between VAD versus no-VAD at the time of transplant (15% vs. 17%; p = 0.66). Multivariate regression analysis found that BMI <20 kg/m The one-year post-transplant mortality rate was no different for ACHD patients that received VAD versus no-VAD. These findings suggest that a VAD should be considered an option to support ACHD patients as a bridge to heart transplantation. 'ACHD', 'VAD', 'heart transplantation', 'transplant outcomes'
