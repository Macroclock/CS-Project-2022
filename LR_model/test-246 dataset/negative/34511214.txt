Advanced Heart Failure in Special Population-Pediatric Age. Heart failure (HF) is an important health care issue in children because of its considerable morbidity and mortality. Advanced HF encompasses patients who remained symptomatic despite optimal medical treatment and includes patients who require special management, such as continuous inotropic therapy, mechanical circulatory support, or heart transplantation (HT). HT is the gold standard for children with advanced HF; nonetheless, the number of suitable donors has not increased for decades, leading to prolonged waitlist times and increased mortality rates. Therefore, the role of pediatric mechanic circulatory support has been assessed as an alternative treatment in patients in whom heart transplant could not be performed. The authors discuss the epidemiology, causes, pathophysiology, clinical manifestation, medical treatment, device therapy, and HT in pediatric HF, and a particular emphasis was posed on patients with advanced HF.
