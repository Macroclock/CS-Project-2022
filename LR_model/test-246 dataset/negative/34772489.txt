Management of Pulmonary Mucormycosis After Orthotopic Heart Transplant: A Case Series. Invasive pulmonary mucormycosis is a potentially fatal infection that can occur in immunosuppressed patients such as those who have undergone orthotopic heart transplant (OHT). High-dose intravenous antifungal agents, including amphotericin B, are generally accepted as the first-line medical treatment, with prompt surgical resection of lesions if feasible. The body of evidence guiding treatment decisions, however, is sparse, particularly regarding adjustment of immunosuppression during acute infection and long-term recovery. We present 2 cases of patients with pulmonary mucormycosis occurring within the first 6 months after OHT, both of whom successfully recovered after appropriate medical and surgical treatment, and we highlight differences in immunosuppression management strategies for this life-threatening condition.
