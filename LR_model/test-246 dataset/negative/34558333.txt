Treatment of HeartMate III-LVAD driveline infection by negative pressure wound therapy: Result of our case series. Driveline infection is one of the most frequent complications following left ventricular assist device (LVAD) treatment and there is no consensus for its management. The standard approach to treat foreign-body infection is complete device ablation, which is not always feasible and therefore not an elected method for LVAD driveline infections. Here we share the results from a series of cases successfully treated for driveline infection by negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) therapy. Between 2016 and 2020, five male patients were hospitalized in our unit with a driveline infection of HeartMate III-LVAD 'Device-related infection', 'HeartMate III', 'driveline infections', 'heart failure', 'left ventricular assist devices', 'negative pressure wound therapy'
