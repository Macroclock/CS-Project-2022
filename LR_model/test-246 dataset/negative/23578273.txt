Fatal herpes simplex virus type 2 hepatitis in a heart transplant recipient: a case report and review of the literature. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) hepatitis is often unrecognized clinically with most untreated cases diagnosed postmortem. HSV hepatitis has been reported in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, mostly in kidney and liver transplants, and rarely in heart transplant recipients. We describe a fatal case of community-acquired HSV-2 hepatitis in a 24-year-old heart transplant recipient occurring 3Â years after transplant. We also review the literature summarizing HSV hepatitis and the potential role of quantitative HSV polymerase chain reaction monitoring in the SOT population.
