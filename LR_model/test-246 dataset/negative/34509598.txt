Contemporary Nationwide Heart Transplantation and Left Ventricular Assist Device Outcomes in Patients with Histories of Bariatric Surgery. Bariatric surgery may play a role in the management of morbidly obese patients with end-stage heart failure through increasing eligibility and improving the outcomes of destination therapies. We conducted a nationally representative, retrospective cohort study of patients with previous bariatric surgery undergoing either heart transplantation or left ventricular assist device implantation. Of 200 patients, < 6% experienced in-hospital mortality after destination therapy, comparable to that reported in the general population of heart recipients. Risk-adjusted outcomes differed minimally from those of obese patients undergoing destination therapy without previous bariatric surgery. This study provides important safety benchmarking data and demonstrates the feasibility of bariatric surgery as a potential bridge to left ventricular assist device implantation or heart transplantation in obese patients with end-stage heart failure.
