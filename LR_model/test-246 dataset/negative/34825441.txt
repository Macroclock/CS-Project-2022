Changes in circumferential strain can differentiate pediatric heart transplant recipients with and without graft rejection. Routine surveillance protocols rely heavily on endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) for detection of rejection in pediatric heart transplant recipients. More sensitive echocardiographic tools to assess rejection may help limit the number of EMBs. This study compared changes in left ventricular (LV) strain in patients who had rejection versus those who did not. A single center retrospective review was conducted between 2013 and 2020. Patients were categorized based on rejection history. Echocardiograms were evaluated at the time of 2 consecutive EMBs; in the rejection group, the second echocardiogram was collected at the time of a rejection episode. Conventional measures of LV function and speckle-tracking echocardiography-derived longitudinal (LS) and circumferential strain (CS) were measured. 17 patients were in the non-rejection group and 17 were in the rejection group (30 total rejection episodes). The rejection group was older at the time of transplant (12.5 vs. 1.3 years, p = .01). A decline in CS was seen in the rejection group at the second echocardiogram [-18.5 (IQR -21.5, -14.6) to -15.7 (IQR -19.8, -13.2)] while CS improved in the non-rejection group [-20.8 (IQR -23.9, -17.8) to -23.9 (IQR -24.9, -20.1)]. This difference in change reached significance (p = .02). A similar pattern was seen in LS that neared significance (p = .06). There was no significant difference in ejection fraction change (p = .24). Patients in the non-rejection group displayed improvement in CS between echocardiograms while patients in the rejection group showed subsequent decline. Worsening of LV CS may help identify acute rejection in the early post-transplant period.
