Treatment of Advanced Heart Failure-Focus on Transplantation and Durable Mechanical Circulatory Support: What Does the Future Hold? Heart transplantation (HTx) is the treatment of choice in patients with late-stage advanced heart failure (Advanced HF). Survival rates 1, 5, and 10 years after transplantation are 87%, 77%, and 57%, respectively, and the average life expectancy is 9.16 years. However, because of the donor organ shortage, waiting times often exceed life expectancy, resulting in a waiting list mortality of around 20%. This review aims to provide an overview of current standard, recent advances, and future developments in the treatment of Advanced HF with a focus on long-term mechanical circulatory support and HTx.
