Impact of transplant center volume on donor heart offer utilization rates in the United States. We tested the hypothesis that transplant centers (TCs) with higher volumes have higher donor heart (DH) offer utilization rates. Using the Annual Data reports of the US Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network and the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) we reviewed all adult heart transplant offers between July 1, 2016 and June 29, 2019. Unadjusted donor offer utilization rates and observed to expected (O/E) DH utilization ratios adjusted using the SRTR model were calculated for each TC for all DH offers and for the following sub-categories: DH with left ventricular ejection fraction <60%, DH >40 years, DH >500 miles from TC, "hard-to-place hearts" (defined as those offered to >50 TCs) and DH designated as increased infectious risk. Univariable linear regression was used to identify a relationship between average yearly center volume and DH utilization. During the study 118,841 total offers were made to 107 TCs and 8300 transplants were performed. The unadjusted utilization rate was not associated with TC volume for all donor offers (p = .517). However, among all subcategories other than DH >40 years, the unadjusted DH utilization rate was associated with TC volume (p < .05). In addition, using the adjusted SRTR O/E ratio, there was a significant impact of TC volume on utilization rate for all donor offers (for an increase TC volume of 10 transplants/year coefficient = 0.095, 95% confidence interval: 0.037-0.151, p = .001). This relationship persisted with an identifiable change for each of the subcategories (p ≤ .001). TC volume is significantly correlated to DH offer utilization rate.
