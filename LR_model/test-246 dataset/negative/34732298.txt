Impact of Ventricular Assist Device-Specific Infections on Post-Heart Transplant Infections: A Retrospective Single-Center Study. Patients with a ventricular assist device (VAD) who are awaiting heart transplant (HTx) are susceptible to infections. Such infections, especially at the site of the VAD, may increase the risk of severe post-transplant infections and mortality. Information on the characteristics of VAD-specific infections and outcomes in HTx recipients after prolonged periods of LVAD therapy is scarce. We aimed to assess the impact of active VAD-specific infections on the incidence of early post-transplant infections and patient survival. We conducted a retrospective review of adult HTx cases at our center between April 2011 and October 2020. Informed consent was waived due to study design. A total of 86 patients were included in this study, among whom 94.2% (n = 81) were bridged with a VAD, and the median VAD support period was 1089 days. Patients with active VAD-specific infections were significantly more likely to develop severe acute mediastinitis [odds ratio (OR) 14.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.83-45.4, P < .01]. Active VAD infections were significantly related to increased length of intensive care unit stay (22.1 days vs 13.0 days, P = .016) and longer mechanical ventilation periods (324.7 hours vs 113.2 hours, P = .03). The 30-day survival rates for patients with and without post-transplant infections were 100% and 97.1%, respectively. Compared to other risk factors, the presence of active VAD-specific infections increases the risk of early post-heart transplant infections and morbidity, without affecting mortality.
