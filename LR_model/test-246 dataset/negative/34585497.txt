Predictors and clinical significance of pericardial effusions after pediatric heart transplantation. We aimed to describe the incidence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of pericardial effusions within 6 months after pediatric heart transplantation (HT). A single-center retrospective cohort study was performed on all pediatric HT recipients from 2004 to 2018. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with pericardial effusions post-HT, and survival was compared using log-rank test. During the study period, 97 HTs were performed in 93 patients. Fifty patients (52%) had a ≥small pericardial effusion within 6 months, 16 of which were, or became, ≥moderate in size. Pericardial drain was placed in 8 patients. In univariate analysis, larger recipient body surface area (p = .01) and non-congenital heart disease (p = .002) were associated with pericardial effusion development. Donor/recipient size ratios, post-HT hemodynamics, and rejection did not correlate with pericardial effusion development. In multivariable analysis, non-congenital heart disease (adjusted odds ratio 3.3, p = .01) remained independently associated with development of pericardial effusion. There were no significant differences in post-HT survival between patients with and without ≥small (p = .68) or ≥moderate pericardial effusions (p = .40). Pericardial effusions are common after pediatric HT. Patients with cardiomyopathy, or non-congenital heart disease, were at higher risk for post-HT pericardial effusions. Pericardial effusions increased morbidity but had no effect on mortality in our cohort. The risk factors identified may be used for anticipatory guidance in pediatric HT.
