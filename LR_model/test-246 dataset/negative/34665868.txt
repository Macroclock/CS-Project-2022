Cheyne-Stokes Respiration in a 17-Year-Old Boy Awaiting Heart Transplantation. Cheyne-Stokes respiration is a pattern of alternating central apnea and hyperpnea. It is well described in adults with congestive heart failure, but not in children. We report the case of a 17-year-old boy whose systolic heart failure was complicated by Cheyne-Stokes respiration. He was given supportive therapy until heart transplant, after which his Cheyne-Stokes respiration clinically resolved. Clinicians should be aware of this uncommon condition in pediatric and adolescent patients who have advanced heart failure and irregular breathing.
