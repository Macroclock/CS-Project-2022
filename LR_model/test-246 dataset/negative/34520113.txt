Haemodynamic parameters associated with renal function prior to and following heart transplantation. Abnormal renal function is a common feature in patients on heart transplant waiting lists. This study aimed to identify the haemodynamic parameters associated with decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients listed for heart transplantation (HT) and renal function improvement following HT. A total of 176 adults (52 years old, 81% men) with available right heart catheterization (RHC) listed in our centre for HT between 2014 and 2019 were studied. Cardiac catheterization measurements were obtained at time of HT listing evaluation. Changes in renal function were assessed between RHC and 6 months after HT. Median eGFR was 63 mL/min/1.73 m Central venous pressure is the main haemodynamic parameter associated with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 'Cardiac index', 'Cardiac oedema', 'Cardiorenal syndrome', 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Heart transplantation', 'Renal function'
