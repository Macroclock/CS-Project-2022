Decreased Global Myocardial Work Efficiency Correlates with Coronary Vasculopathy in Pediatric Heart Transplant Patients. Coronary angiography remains the standard for diagnosis of cardiac transplant vasculopathy (CAV), but it is invasive. Non-invasively derived left ventricle (LV) global myocardial work (GMW) indices have not been evaluated. We aimed to assess for correlations between LV GMW and the presence of CAV in a pediatric population. 24 heart transplant patients and 24 normal controls were prospectively enrolled. Patients were age-matched into groups with: orthotopic heart transplant and CAV (OHT-CAV; 6 patients, 33% male, mean age 13.5 years [SD 4.2]), orthotopic heart transplant without CAV (OHT; 18 patients, 67% male, mean age 11.1 years [SD 4.8]), and normal healthy controls (42% male, mean age 12.8 years [SD 5.0]). Transplant patients underwent cardiac catheterization with coronary angiography within 3 months of echocardiogram. Post-processing of echocardiograms with speckle-tracking echocardiography and derivation of GMW indices was performed. OHT-CAV patients had decreased global work efficiency (GWE) compared to OHT (mean difference = 7.01 [1.76, 12.25], adjusted p < 0.01). LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) and LV ejection fraction were not different between groups. Both global work index and GWE were decreased in OHT-CAV and OHT when compared to normal controls (OHT-CAV 1311.23 mmHg% vs OHT 1426.22 mmHg% vs controls 1802.81 mmHg%, adjusted p < 0.01; OHT-CAV 83.87% vs. OHT 90.87% vs. controls 95.41%, adjusted p < 0.01). GWE correlated negatively with the presence of CAV (r = - 0.44 [- 0.72, - 0.05]). This pilot study demonstrates decreased GWE correlates with pediatric CAV. This supports the need for further investigation of this promising diagnostic tool.
