Effect of oral L-arginine on oxidant stress, endothelial dysfunction, and systemic arterial pressure in young cardiac transplant recipients. Oral L-arginine therapy reverses endothelial dysfunction and attenuates high blood pressure in hypertensive cardiac transplant recipients. L-arginine corrects derangements in the vascular endothelial nitric oxide (NO)-dependent signaling pathway. Our data support the concept that cardiac transplant recipients use excess endogenous NO from L-arginine supplementation to buffer increased vascular oxidant stress.
