Cardiac transplantation: a temporary solution for Friedreich's ataxia-induced dilated cardiomyopathy. Friedreich's ataxia is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease.

To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a heart transplantation for Friedreich's ataxia dilated cardiomyopathy.
