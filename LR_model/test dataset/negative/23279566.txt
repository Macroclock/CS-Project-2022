Blockade of p-selectin is sufficient to reduce MHC I antibody-elicited monocyte recruitment in vitro and in vivo. Donor-specific HLA antibodies significantly lower allograft survival, but as yet there are no satisfactory therapies for prevention of antibody-mediated rejection. Intracapillary macrophage infiltration is a hallmark of antibody-mediated rejection, and macrophages are important in both acute and chronic rejection. The purpose of this study was to investigate the Fc-independent effect of HLA I antibodies on endothelial cell activation, leading to monocyte recruitment. We used an in vitro model to assess monocyte binding to endothelial cells in response to HLA I antibodies. We confirmed our results in a mouse model of antibody-mediated rejection, in which B6.RAG1(-/-)  recipients of BALB/c cardiac allografts were passively transferred with donor-specific MHC I antibodies. Our findings demonstrate that HLA I antibodies rapidly increase intracellular calcium and endothelial presentation of P-selectin, which supports monocyte binding. In the experimental model, donor-specific MHC I antibodies significantly increased macrophage accumulation in the allograft. Concurrent administration of rPSGL-1-Ig abolished antibody-induced monocyte infiltration in the allograft, but had little effect on antibody-induced endothelial injury. Our data suggest that antagonism of P-selectin may ameliorate accumulation of macrophages in the allograft during antibody-mediated rejection.
