The right axillary artery approach for the Impella Recover LP 5.0 microaxial pump. As a ventricular unloading catheter, the Impella Recover LP 5.0 (Abiomed, Danvers, MA) is appropriate for temporary circulatory assistance in severe left ventricular dysfunction. We describe a new implantation approach to the right axillary artery with the aims of avoiding vascular problems due to atherosclerosis of the peripheral arteries and improving patient mobility and rehabilitation during mechanical support.
