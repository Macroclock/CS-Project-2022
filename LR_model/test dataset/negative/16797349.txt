Trapidil decreases the aggregation of platelets from heart transplant recipients ex vivo. Heart transplant recipients show platelet hyperaggregability, which may be related to the incidence of graft vasculopathy. We investigated whether trapidil can inhibit the aggregation of platelets from these patients. Platelet count, mean platelet volume (MPV), and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation were determined in 18 heart transplant recipients and 12 healthy subjects. Additionally, platelet-rich plasma from the patients was incubated with trapidil or with saline, prior to measuring ADP-induced aggregation. The MPV was significantly greater in patients compared to controls (9.4+/-1.1 vs 8.5+/-0.7 fL; P=.01), and ADP-induced platelet aggregation was significantly increased in patients compared to controls (81.2%+/-13.1% vs 69.6%+/-16.2%; P=.04, respectively). The trapidil-treated samples showed significantly decreased platelet aggregation compared to the control samples (24.2%+/-12.6% vs 66.7%+/-11.7%; P<.001). Platelets from heart transplant recipients showed an increased MPV and increased ADP-induced aggregation. Trapidil effectively reduced the ADP-induced aggregation ex vivo.
