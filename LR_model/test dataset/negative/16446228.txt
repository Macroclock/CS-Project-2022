Reversible sirolimus-associated pneumonitis after heart transplantation. Sirolimus (rapamycin) and everolimus are immunosuppressive agents that inhibit cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Sirolimus has been widely used in renal transplantation, and its use in heart transplantation is increasing. Sirolimus-associated pneumonitis has been described in renal transplant patients. Two cases of sirolimus-associated pneumonitis have been reported after cardiac transplantation. Only 1 case has been described in detail, and this had a fatal outcome. Here, we present a case of sirolimus-associated interstitial pneumonitis in a cardiac transplant recipient that resolved completely with withdrawal of the drug and treatment with corticosteroids.
