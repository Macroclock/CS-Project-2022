Modulation of gene expression by alloimmune networks following murine heart transplantation. The objective of our study was to analyze gene expression profiles in a complex in vivo model of solid organ transplantation, and to investigate the effects of single-gene deletions on alloimmunity. Using algorithms to generate dendrograms and self-organizing maps, we differentiated the alloimmune profiles of 16 transgenic knockout mouse strains, and identified subsets of genes that correlate with the duration of graft survival and provide candidates for prognostic and diagnostic indicators following transplantation in our model system.
