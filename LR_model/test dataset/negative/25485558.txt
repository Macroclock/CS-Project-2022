Minimally invasive removal of a temporary RVAD. We describe a minimally invasive technique for the removal of a temporary right ventricular assist device (RVAD) that provided support concomitant with durable left ventricular assist device support. The RVAD cannulas are mobilized through a small subxiphoid incision at the cannula exit site. Both cannulas are transected subcutaneously, then occluded with plugs made of rolled bovine pericardium, and the skin is closed. The cannula remnants are left in place until heart transplantation is accomplished. To minimize risk of thrombus formation at the cannula tips and subsequent embolization into the right atrium or pulmonary artery, anticoagulation is increased to achieve an international normalized ratio (INR) in the range of 2.5-3.0.
