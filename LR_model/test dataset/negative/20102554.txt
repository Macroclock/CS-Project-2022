Endocrine heart after lung transplantation: increased brain natriuretic peptide is related to right ventricular function. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) increases in proportion to the extent of right ventricular dysfunction in pulmonary hypertension and after heart transplantation. No data are available after lung transplantation. Clinical, biological, respiratory, echocardiographic characteristics and circulating BNP and its second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) were determined in thirty matched subjects (10 lung-, 10 heart-transplant recipients (Ltx, Htx) and 10 healthy controls). Eventual correlations between these parameters were investigated. Heart rate and pulmonary arterial blood pressure were slightly increased after transplantation. Creatinine clearance was decreased. Mean of forced expiratory volume in 1 s was 76.6 +/- 5.3% and vital capacity was 85.3 +/- 6.4% of the predicted values in Ltx. BNP was similarly increased in Ltx and Htx, as compared with control values (54.1 +/- 14.2 and 45.6 +/- 9.2 vs. 6.2 +/- 1.8 pg/ml, respectively). Significant relationships were observed between plasma BNP and cGMP values (r = 0.62; P < 0.05 and r = 0.75; P < 0.01, in Ltx and Htx) and between BNP and right ventricular fractional shortening and tricuspid E/Ea ratio in Ltx (r = -0.75 and r = 0.93; P < 0.01, respectively). BNP is increased after lung transplantation, like after heart transplantation. The relationships observed suggest that the cardiac hormone might counterbalance possible deleterious effects of lung-transplantation on right functioning of patient's heart.
