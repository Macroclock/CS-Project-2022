Impact of ventricular assist device implantation on the nutritional status of children awaiting heart transplantation. Malnutrition is common in pediatric heart failure and is associated with mortality. The effect of VAD support on malnutrition in children is unknown. We sought to compare the prevalence and severity of malnutrition at HT in children on VAD support vs OMT to inform decisions regarding support strategies. Retrospective chart review involving all patients <18 years who underwent HT at Stanford between 1/1/2011 and 3/1/2018. Malnutrition diagnosis and severity were defined by ASPEN guidelines using the lowest age-adjusted z-score for weight (WAZ), height (HAZ), and BMI (BMIZ) when the patient was euvolemic. Changes in z-scores from baseline to HT and across groups were analyzed. A total of 104 patients (52 in each group) were included. Among all patients, WAZ (-0.9 vs 0.3, P < 0.001) and BMIZ (0 vs 0.6, P < 0.001) improved while HAZ (-0.9 vs -0.9, P = 0.4) did not. Compared to children on OMT, children on VAD experienced greater increases in WAZ (0.8 vs 0.3, P < 0.001) and BMIZ (0.7 vs 0.2, P < 0.003) at HT. The prevalence of moderate-to-severe malnutrition decreased in VAD patients (40% to 19%, P < 0.001) and increased in OMT patients (37% to 46%, P < 0.001), leading to a lower prevalence of moderate-to-severe malnutrition at HT (19% vs 46%, P = 0.003). Malnutrition is common in pediatric HT candidates. Compared to children on OMT, children on VAD support had greater improvement in nutritional status while awaiting HT, and a lower prevalence of malnutrition at HT.
