Extracorporeal Life Support After Pulmonary Endarterectomy as a Bridge to Recovery or Transplantation: Lessons From 31 Consecutive Patients. Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) can be used to sustain patients having cardiorespiratory failure after pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA). We aimed to assess outcomes and to identify factors associated with short-term survival among patients who required ECLS after PEA. We reviewed the charts of consecutive patients who required ECLS after PEA between 2005 and 2013 at our institution. Patients with failed PEA were scheduled for heart-lung transplantation, and patients with potentially reversible hemodynamic or respiratory failure were given appropriate supportive care until recovery. Of the 829 patients who underwent PEA, 31 (3.7%) required postoperative ECLS. Of these, 23 continued to receive support, and 8 were listed for heart-lung transplantation during ECLS. Overall inhospital survival was 48.4% (15 of 31). Of patients listed for transplantation, 2 died while on support; 4 of the 6 patients undergoing transplantation lived to hospital discharge. Of the 23 supportive care patients, 11 (47.8%) were alive at hospital discharge. The factors associated with survival were younger age (p = 0.02), larger post-PEA decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure (p = 0.020), lower post-PEA total pulmonary resistance (p = 0.008), and pure respiratory failure related to reperfusion edema or airway bleeding (p = 0.003). Extracorporeal life support may be useful to support patients with complications after PEA either to recovery or to salvage transplantation.
