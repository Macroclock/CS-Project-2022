Ethylene carbodiimide-fixed donor splenocytes combined with α-1 antitrypsin induce indefinite donor-specific protection to mice cardiac allografts. Peritransplant infusion of ethylene carbodiimide-fixed donor splenocytes (ECDI-SPs) induces protection of islet and cardiac allografts. However, pro-inflammatory cytokine production during the peritransplantation period may negate the effect of ECDI-SPs. Therefore, we hypothesized that blocking pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion while increasing levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines would enhance the tolerance-induced efficacy of ECDI-SPs. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of using ECDI-SPs combined with a short course of α1-antitrypsin (AAT) for induction of tolerance. Using a mice cardiac transplant model, we demonstrated that ECDI-SPs + AAT effectively induced indefinite mice cardiac allograft protection in a donor-specific fashion. This effect was accompanied by modulation of cytokines through decreasing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, and IL-23) and increasing levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (including IL-10, IL-13, and TGF-β), and by inhibition of effector T cells (Teff) and expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Therefore, we concluded that combined ECDI-SPs and AAT appeared to modulate the expression of cytokines and regulate the Teff:Treg balance to create a support milieu for graft protection. Our strategy of combining ECDI-SPs and AAT provides a promising approach for inducing donor-specific transplant tolerance.
