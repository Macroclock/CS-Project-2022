[Endomyocardial disease: a case report]. Endomyocardial disease is a form of restrictive cardiomyopathy, of unknown etiology, which occurs most commonly in tropical and subtropical areas. It is characterized by the formation of endomyocardial fibrosis of the apical and subvalvular regions of one or both ventricles. A 29-year-old male patient was admitted with restrictive cardiomyopathy and decompensated heart failure. Telecardiography showed cardiomegaly and right pleural effusion. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed preserved left ventricular systolic functions, biatrial dilatation, apical obliteration of both ventricles, increased endocardial echoreflectivity, and pericardial effusion. The right ventricular outflow tract was dilated. There was no endocardial thickening in this region. Doppler examination showed grade 3 mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Ventriculograms showed apical obliteration of both ventricles, marked decrease in the size of the right ventricular cavity, significant dilatation of the right ventricular outflow tract and both atria, and severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Laboratory findings showed no hypereosinophilia. Hepatic congestion, splenomegaly, and ascites were noted on abdominal ultrasonography. Following cardiac catheterization, the patient was placed on the waiting list for cardiac transplantation.
