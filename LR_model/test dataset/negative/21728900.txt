Myocardial infarction induces early increased remote ADAM8 expression of rat hearts after cardiac arrest. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase-8 (ADAM8) is a potential surrogate of inflammation which has recently been associated with myocardial infarction. We evaluated in a rat cardiac transplantation model whether ischemia-reperfusion injury alone (IRI) or with early regional myocardial infarction (MI) would suffice to induce inflammatory myocardial remodeling and ADAM8 expression. Isogenic heterotopic cardiac transplantation after cardiac arrest was performed to 48 Fischer 344 rats to induce ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), of which 27 rats also underwent ligation of the left anterior coronary artery (LAD) of the heart to yield MI. Histology was performed at 0.5, 24 and 48 h after transplantation. ADAM8 was evaluated by qRT-PCR after graft harvesting. After 0.5 and 48 h respectively, edematous intramyocardial artery nuclei and periadventitial inflammation were more prominent in MI after transplantation, as compared with IRI alone and Controls (57.0 vs 40.0 and 5.0; 1.9 vs 1.1 and 0.9, point score units, p < 0.05, respectively). The expression of ADAM-8 was increased in MI as compared with Controls (1.9 vs 1.0, 1.9 fold increase) at 48 h. In grafts with MI, ADAM8 was localized using immunohistochemistry to the vicinity of the area corresponding to the developing infarction as well as in intramyocardial arteries remote to the infarction area. Remote histopathological changes of ischemic cardiac grafts are associated with increased expression of ADAM8 thus emphasizing a global myocardial impact of MI.
