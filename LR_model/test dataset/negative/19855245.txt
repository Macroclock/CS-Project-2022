Chemokine receptor blockade with a synthetic nonpeptide compound attenuates cardiac allograft vasculopathy. BACKGROUND.: Recruitment of recipient mononuclear cells to the donor heart is a central event in the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). The role of individual chemokine receptors in this process is incompletely defined. TAK-779 (N,N-dimethyl-N-[4-[[[2-(4-methylphenyl)-6,7-dihydro-5H-benzocyclohepten-8-yl]carbonyl]amino]benzyl]tetra-hydro-2H-pyran-4-aminium chloride) is a synthetic nonpeptide antagonist of CCR5 and CXCR3. The purpose of this study is to determine if combined CCR5 and CXCR3 blockade by TAK-779 would attenuate CAV in an experimental model. METHODS.: We used a previously characterized murine model of CAV. Recipient mice were treated with TAK-779 or vehicle control. Donor hearts were harvested on day 24 posttransplantation and analyzed for intimal thickening and cellular infiltration. Recipient splenocytes were analyzed for proliferative response and interferon (IFN)-gamma production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay. The donor hearts were also examined for heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene induction. RESULTS.: CCR5 and CXCR3 blockade by TAK-779 reduced the severity of intimal lesions (53+/-10% vs. 16+/-2%; P<0.05) and decreased the number of graft infiltrating CCR5 and CXCR3 CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes. Moreover, treatment with TAK-779 (a) decreased alloantigen-specific T-lymphocyte proliferation and number of IFN-gamma producing cells and (b) increased HO-1 gene transcript level in the allografts. CONCLUSIONS.: Antagonism of CCR5 and CXCR3 by TAK-779 is effective in controlling CAV. The beneficial effects of TAK-779 may be because of (a) reduction in CCR5 and CXCR3 T-lymphocyte subset infiltration into the graft, (b) attenuation of alloantigen-specific T-lymphocyte proliferative response and IFN-gamma production, and (c) induction of HO-1 gene. This compound may offer a novel approach in clinical management of CAV.
