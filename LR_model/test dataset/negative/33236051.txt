Orthotopic heart transplantation and concomitant aortic arch replacement in an adult Fontan patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Heart failure and neoaortic dilation are common long-term complications in patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome after single-ventricle palliation. Orthotopic heart transplantation and concomitant transverse aortic arch replacement can be performed safely and effectively. The addition of preoperative three-dimensional modelling can supplement operative planning, facilitate intraoperative execution, and optimize clinical outcomes.
