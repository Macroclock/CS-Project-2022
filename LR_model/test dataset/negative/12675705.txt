Failure of immunotherapy to prevent, arrest or reverse diabetic lumbosacral plexopathy. Three patients are described who had severe and progressive diabetic lumbosacral plexopathy despite active immunosuppressive therapy. One patient developed the condition while immunosuppressed for a cardiac transplant and two others progressed while receiving intravenous gamma globulin. The cases raise questions about current unsupported practices of treatment for this condition. Robust clinical trial evidence is required before immunosuppression can be recommended.
