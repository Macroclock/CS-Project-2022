Depression and quality of life in terms of personal resources in heart transplant recipients. Heart transplantation is the first option for treatment of heart failure engendering increased survival and quality of life among recipients. However, this surgical intervention causes many psychological problems such as depression and anxiety. Protective factors and personal recourses are significant forces behind healthy adjustments to life stresses. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of depression among heart transplant recipients. The study consisted of a sample of 46 patients after heart transplantation. Standardized instruments used to measure the key constructs were Beck Depression Inventory Short Form for the prevalence of depression, World Health Organization Quality of Life--BREF for quality of life, Sense of Coherence (SOC-29), and Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced BREF to identify coping strategies. The data were analyzed statistically. We found that sense of coherence and coping strategies were significant predictors for quality of life and prevalence of depression, which were significantly associated with each others. Strategies focused on the problem are moderate quality of life with an age of recipient. Recipients who have a tendency to use emotion-focused strategies and are older showed a poorer quality of life, were less satisfied with their health, and displayed a prevalence of depression. These results suggested that assessment of coping strategies and sense of coherence should be explored in heart transplant recipients with skills training in this domain.
