Allergies and autoimmune disorders in children after heart transplantation. Pediatric heart transplantation requires lifelong immune suppression and may require thymectomy, both of which alter T-cell repertoires. We hypothesized that atopic and autoimmune diseases are more common in pediatric heart transplant patients than the general population, and that transplantation in early childhood increases the risk of development or worsening of atopic or autoimmune disease. A cross-sectional single-center study including 21 heart transplant patients aged ≤18 years was conducted. Data collected included age at transplant, induction, thymectomy, and development and severity of atopic or autoimmune disease. A majority (67%) reported having any atopic disease post-transplant, all of whom reported onset or worsening post-transplantation. Thymectomized patients were significantly more likely to have asthma (P = 0.018) and report asthma worsening post-transplant (P = 0.045). Patients with worsening of asthma post-transplant were transplanted at a significantly younger age (P = 0.040). ABO incompatible and ABO compatible recipients presented similarly. Anemia was common (38%) but not always clearly of autoimmune origin. Atopic diseases are common in children following heart transplantation: Compared to the general population, there is a higher prevalence of eczema (43% vs 11%) and asthma (33% vs 9%). Both thymectomy and younger age at transplant are associated with atopic disorders, possibly due to altered T-cell repertoires.
