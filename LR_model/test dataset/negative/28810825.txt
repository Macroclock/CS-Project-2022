Regulatory T-Cell Levels in the Longest Surviving Asian Patient After Heart-Lung Transplant. Heart-lung transplant is the most effective therapy for patients with end-stage cardiopulmonary disease. Here, we report an initial assessment of a 31-year-old man who had survived more than 11 years after heart-lung transplant, which represents the longest survival time in this procedure in Asian studies. At his 11th anniversary after transplant, extensive tests were carried out, especially to detect regulatory T-cell levels for the first time in a surviving heart-lung transplant recipient. Preliminarily data revealed the status of his immunologic function in relation to chronic allograft rejection. All data indicated that the patient was in good condition. This is the first study detecting regulatory T-cell levels in a heart-lung transplant patient.
