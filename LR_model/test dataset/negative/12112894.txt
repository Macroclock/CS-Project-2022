Endovascular stent placement for venous obstruction after cardiac transplantation in children and young adults. Survival following cardiac transplantation in children and adults, including the group with complex congenital heart disease, has improved over the last decade secondary to medical and surgical advances in management. There have been rare reports of superior vena cava obstruction at anastomotic sites following transplantation. In patients following heart transplantation, venous stenosis can limit the ability to perform endomyocardial biopsies. We reviewed our experience in three patients who underwent cardiac transplantation and developed significant venous stenosis requiring intervention. All three were successfully treated by transcatheter implantation of endovascular stents. Endovascular stent implantation for venous obstruction in patients following cardiac transplantation was safe and effective, allowing improved ease of catheterization for future posttransplantation monitoring and surveillance.
