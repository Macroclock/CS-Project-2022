Autoimmune sensitization to cardiac myosin leads to acute rejection of cardiac allografts in miniature swine. Recent studies in mice and patients suggest that posttransplantation induction of autoimmune responses to tissue-specific antigens contributes to the rejection of major histocompatibility complex mismatched allotransplants. The relevance of this phenomenon to the rejection of major and minor histocompatibility-mismatched allografts performed in large-animal models remains to be established. Miniature swine were immunized with cardiac myosin (CM) in Freund's adjuvant and received heterotopic, minor antigen-mismatched heart transplants. T-cell (proliferation and delayed type hypersensitivity [DTH]) and B-cell (antibody) responses specific to CM were measured. The rejection of heart transplants was assessed histologically. Three of four swine that were immunized with CM before receiving a minor antigen-mismatched heart transplant exhibited potent DTH, T-cell proliferation and antibody responses to CM and rejected their grafts acutely. The fourth swine, which failed to mount a significant DTH response to CM and displayed low and transient anti-CM antibody titers, demonstrated long-term allograft survival. This large-animal study supports the relevance of autoimmunity to CM in the rejection of minor antigen disparate cardiac allotransplants.
