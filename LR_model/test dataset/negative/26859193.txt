Plasmacytoma-like Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder in a Pediatric Heart Transplant Recipient. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a diversely manifesting group of lymphoid or plasmacytic proliferations found in solid organ and bone marrow transplant recipients. PTLD occurs as a result of immunosuppression and is often driven by the Epstein Barr virus. Although most commonly of B-cell origin, similar to B-cell lymphomas, PTLD can rarely present as a plasmacytic process, resembling multiple myeloma. Although more common in adults, 8 cases of plasmacytoma-like PTLD have been reported in pediatric renal and combined small bowel-liver transplant recipients. Here, we present a rare report of a plasmacytoma-like PTLD case in a pediatric heart transplant recipient.
