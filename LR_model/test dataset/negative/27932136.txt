Prognostic Value of High-Sensitivity Troponin-T to Identify Patients at Risk of Left Ventricular Graft Dysfunction After Heart Transplantation. Primary graft dysfunction after heart transplantation (HTx) has a very high mortality rate, especially if the left ventricle (PGD-LV) is involved. Early diagnosis is important to select the appropriate therapy to improve prognosis. The value of high-sensitivity troponin T (HS-TNT) measurement obtained at patient arrival at the intensive care unit was analyzed in 71 HTx patients. Mild or moderate PGD-LV was defined by hemodynamic compromise with one of the following criteria: left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, hemodynamic compromise with right atrial pressure >15 mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure >20 mm Hg, cardiac index <2.0 L/min/m
