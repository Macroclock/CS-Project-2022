Treatment of unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis in a 5-year-old heart transplant patient using a sirolimus-eluting stent. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is the most common cause of long-term graft failure in adult and pediatric heart transplant recipients. In the absence of a specific treatment for this condition, percutaneous revascularization has been the main palliative treatment in the adult population. Revascularization of pediatric patients, however, is more problematic secondary to the lack of a large pool of outcome data and the encounter of special technical challenges. We present the case of a 5-year-old girl who presented with severe cardiac allograft vasculopathy of her left main coronary artery and was treated with sirolimus stent placement.
