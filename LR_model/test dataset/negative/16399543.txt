Atrial fibrillation as a cause of left ventricular dysfunction after cardiac transplantation. We report 3 cases of late-onset atrial fibrillation several years after cardiac transplantation, each involving left ventricular systolic dysfunction in the absence of cardiac rejection or cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Although the etiology of late-onset atrial fibrillation in cardiac transplant recipients is not clear, its presence in the absence of cardiac rejection or coronary allograft vasculopathy can result in left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and therefore should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cardiac allograft failure. The onset of atrial fibrillation years after a heart transplant is not necessarily an indication of rejection. Aggressive rate control and restoration of normal sinus rhythm may improve allograft function in such cases.
