The influence of antigen-dependent and antigen-independent factors on the development of graft vasculopathy in a fully allogeneic cardiac allograft model in the rat. Graft vasculopathy (GVP) is one of the major obstacles to long-term graft and patient survival after cardiac transplantation and a major reason for morbidity and mortality. Antigen-dependent and antigen-independent factors play causal roles in the development of GVP. The aim of this study was to evaluate antigen-dependent and -independent factors in the development of GVR in a clinically relevant fully allogeneic rat cardiac model under immunosuppression with cyclosporine (CyA). Lewis rats were challenged with Wistar-Furth cardiac allografts. Acute rejection occurred within 10 days after engraftment (n = 6). Daily SC administration of CyA (2.5 mg/kg body weight, n = 12) led to long-term graft survival (>100 days) but did not prevent GVP (Adams Score: 1.7 +/- 1.9, n = 4). Isografts did not develop GVP. In allografts, the dose modification of CyA to 5 mg or 1.25 mg/kg body weight as well as the prolongation of ischemia from 45 minutes to 4 hours did not increase the development of GVP. In isografts, the prolongation of ischemic time from 45 minutes to 4 hours significantly increased the development of GVP (Adams score, 0.3 +/- 0.8 [n = 7] vs 1.2 +/- 1.9 [n = 6]; P < .05). In this fully allogeneic cardiac allograft model with clinically relevant immunosuppressive therapy, GVP was induced independent of the applied CyA dose. In addition, the prolongation of ischemic time did not increase the development of GVP. Isografts only developed significant GVP with long ischemia times. Therefore, an initial injury, either prolonged ischemia time or an allogeneic immune response, predispressed to the development of GVP.
