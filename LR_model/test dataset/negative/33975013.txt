Novel biomarkers useful in surveillance of graft rejection after heart transplantation. Heart transplantation (HTx) is considered the gold-standard therapy for the treatment of advanced heart failure (HF). The long-term survival in HTx is hindered by graft failure which represents one of the major limitations of the long-term efficacy of HTx. Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) and the evaluation of donor-specific antibodies (DSA) are currently considered the essential diagnostic tools for surveillance of graft rejection. Recently, new molecular biomarkers (including cell-free DeoxyriboNucleic Acid, exosomes, gene profiling microarray, nanostring, reverse transcriptase multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, proteomics and immune profiling by quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence) provide useful information on mechanisms of graft rejection. The ambitious role of a similar change of perspective is aimed at a better and longer graft preservation.
