Long-Term Continuous-Flow Biventricular Support in a 63-Year-Old Woman. We describe the successful use of long-term biventricular continuous-flow mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to transplantation in a small-framed 63-year-old woman with long-standing nonischemic cardiomyopathy. After placement of a left-sided HeartWare HVAD, persistent right-sided heart failure necessitated implantation of a second HeartWare device for long-term right ventricular support. After 262 days, the patient underwent successful orthotopic heart transplantation and was discharged from the hospital. This report indicates the feasibility of biventricular device support in older patients of relatively small stature, and our results may encourage others to consider this therapy in similar patient populations.
