Current understanding and management of allograft vasculopathy. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the major obstacle to long-term survival after heart transplantation. It is a rapidly progressive, obliterative form of coronary vasculopathy distinct from classic atheromatous disease. The pathogenesis is most likely multifactorial and involves both alloantigen dependent and independent mechanisms. Since there is no definitive treatment for CAV and new immunosuppressive agents can only slow the progression of this disease, the prophylaxis and modification of numerous risk factors remains the foundation of posttransplant management in the heart transplant recipient. In this review, we discuss current understanding of the pathogenesis of CAV, novel diagnostic and therapeutic avenues and explore optimal approaches to risk factors modification.
