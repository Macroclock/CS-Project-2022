Long-term preservation using a new apparatus combined with suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines improves donor heart function after transplantation in a canine model. We developed a new apparatus for long-term heart preservation that combines simple immersion with coronary perfusion. In a previous study, we reported that suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), improved results after transplantation. In this study, we evaluated whether long-term preservation using our apparatus for continuous coronary perfusion, combined with suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, improves donor heart function after transplantation in a canine model. We used adult mongrel dogs in this study. Coronary vascular beds were washed with University of Wisconsin (UW) solution after arresting hearts with glucose-insulin-potassium solution. The heart was then excised and preserved for 12 hours with a combination of immersion and coronary perfusion using a preservation apparatus. Adult mongrel dogs were divided into 2 groups: the coronary perfusion (CP) group (n = 7) and the FR167653 (FR-CP) group (n = 6). In the CP group, we used a 4 degrees C UW solution for immersion and coronary perfusion. In the FR-CP group, we used a 4 degrees C UW solution supplemented with 20 mg/liter of the anti-inflammatory agent FR167653 for immersion and coronary perfusion. At 2 and at 3 hours after orthotopic transplantation, we compared hemodynamic parameters with pre-operative values in donor animals, with right atrial pressure at 10 mm Hg and with 5 microg/kg/min dopamine infusion. We compared serum concentrations of TNF-alpha from the coronary sinus and compared electron microscopic studies between the 2 groups. Three hours after transplantation, cardiac output (CO), left ventricular pressure (LVP), and -LVdp/dt were significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the FR-CP group than in the CP group (CO, 178% +/- 65% vs 93% +/- 40%; LVP, 115% +/- 22% vs 73% +/-26%; -LVdp/dt, 168% +/- 13% vs 61% +/- 17%, respectively). Electron microscopic studies showed that glycogen was well preserved in the FR-CP group compared with the CP group. Serum concentrations of TNF-alpha were decreased significantly in the FR-CP group compared with the CP group at 3 hours after reperfusion (161 +/- 54 pg/dl vs 642 +/- 636 pg/dl, respectively). Hemodynamics after transplantation were significantly better in the FR-CP group than in the CP group. The combined preservation method of continuous perfusion and immersion using our apparatus in conjunction with suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines improves donor heart function after transplantation.
