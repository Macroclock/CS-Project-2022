Frequency of Congruence and Incongruence Between the Clinical and Morphological Diagnoses in Patients Having Orthotopic Heart Transplantations at the Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas From 1993 to 2020. We studied the explanted hearts of 519 patients having Orthotopic Heart Transplant (OHT) at Baylor University Medical Center from 2013 to 2020 and compared the morphologic diagnoses to the clinical diagnoses before OHT. We then combined these findings with the findings from 314 patients who had been studied in the laboratory from 1993 to 2012. Thus, the total number of patients included in the overall study were 833. Among the 833 patients the morphologic and clinical diagnoses were congruent in 760 (91%) and incongruent in 73 (9%) cases. Most of the incongruity occurred among the patients with cardiac sarcoidosis (27/36 [75%]), arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (11/19 [58%]), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (8/25 [32%]). The frequency of incongruence among 833 patients having OHT in an 27 year period was 9%, with no significant difference between the 314 patients studied from 1998 to 2012, and the 519 studied from 2013 to 2020.
