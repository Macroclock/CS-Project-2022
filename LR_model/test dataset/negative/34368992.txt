Impact of center donor acceptance patterns on utilization of extended-criteria donors and outcomes. This study investigated the impact of transplanting center donor acceptance patterns on usage of extended-criteria donors (ECDs) and posttransplant outcomes following orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). The Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients was queried to identify heart donor offers and adult, isolated OHT recipients in the United States from January 1, 2013 to October 17, 2018. Centers were stratified into three equal-size terciles based on donor heart acceptance rates (<13.7%, 13.7%-20.2%, >20.2%). Overall survival was compared between recipients of ECDs (≥40 years, left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] <60%, distance ≥500 miles, hepatitis B virus [HBV], hepatitis C virus [HCV], or human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], or ≥50 refusals) and recipients of traditional-criteria donors, and among transplanting terciles. A total of 85,505 donor heart offers were made to 133 centers with 15,264 (17.9%) accepted for OHT. High-acceptance programs (>20.2%) more frequently accepted donors with LVEF <60%, HIV, HCV, and/or HBV, ≥50 offers, or distance >500 miles from the transplanting center (each p < .001). Posttransplant survival was comparable across all three terciles (p = .11). One- and five-year survival were also similar across terciles when examining recipients of all five ECD factors. Acceptance tier and increasing acceptance rate were not found to have any impact on mortality in multivariable modeling. Of ECD factors, only age ≥40 years was found to have increased hazards for mortality (hazard ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-1.46; p < .001). Of recipients of ECD hearts, outcomes are similar across center-acceptance terciles. Educating less aggressive programs to increase donor acceptance and ECD utilization may yield higher national rates of OHT without major impact on outcomes.
