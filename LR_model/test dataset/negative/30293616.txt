Changes in renal function after left ventricular assist device placement in pediatric patients: A Pedimacs analysis. Renal dysfunction (RD) is prevalent among pediatric patients with advanced heart failure. Data are limited regarding changes in renal function after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement in this population. Pediatric LVAD recipients enrolled in the Pediatric Interagency Registry for Mechanical Circulatory Support (Pedimacs) between September 19, 2012 and June 30, 2016 were included. Longitudinal changes in renal function were analyzed for the entire cohort as well as subgroups stratified by patient and device characteristics. Logistic regression was used to attempt to identify factors associated with lack of improvement in renal function after LVAD placement. Post-LVAD outcomes were assessed using the Kaplanâ€’Meier method. Data from 247 patients from 39 centers were analyzed. Baseline RD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <90 ml/min/1.73 m Renal function improves post-LVAD placement in pediatric patients regardless of age, diagnosis, illness severity, or device type, with improvement most pronounced in patients with baseline RD. Identifying patients with irreversible renal dysfunction before LVAD placement remains difficult. Pre-LVAD renal function does not appear to impact survival to transplant.
