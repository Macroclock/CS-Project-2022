Mitochondrial transplantation for myocardial protection in ex-situ‒perfused hearts donated after circulatory death. Donation after circulatory death (DCD) offers an additional source of cardiac allografts, potentially allowing expansion of the donor pool, but is limited owing to the effects of ischemia. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of mitochondrial transplantation to enhance myocardial function of DCD hearts. Circulatory death was induced in Yorkshire pigs (40-50 kg, n = 29) by a cessation of mechanical ventilation. After 20 minutes of warm ischemia, cardioplegia was administered. The hearts were then reperfused on an ex-situ blood perfusion system. After 15 minutes of reperfusion, hearts received either vehicle alone (vehicle [VEH], 10 ml; n = 8) or vehicle containing autologous mitochondria (vehicle with mitochondria as a single injection [MT], 5 × 10 At the end of 4 hours of reperfusion, MT and MT Mitochondrial transplantation significantly preserves myocardial function and oxygen consumption in DCD hearts, thus providing a possible option for expanding the heart donor pool.
