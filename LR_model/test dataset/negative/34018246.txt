Risk factors for heart transplant survival with greater than 5 h of donor heart ischemic time. Implantation of donor hearts with prolonged ischemic times is associated with worse survival. We sought to identify risk factors that modulate the effects of prolonged preservation. Retrospective review of the United Network for Organ Sharing database (2000-2018) to identify transplants with >5 (n = 1526) or ≤5 h (n = 35,733) of donor heart preservation. In transplanted hearts preserved for >5 h, Cox-proportional hazards identify modifiers for survival. Compared to ≤5 h, transplanted patients with >5 h of preservation spent less time in status 1B (76 ± 160 vs. 85 ± 173 days, p = .027), more commonly had ischemic cardiomyopathy (42.3% vs. 38.3%, p = .002), and less commonly received a blood type O heart (45.4% vs. 50.8%, p < .001). Longer heart preservation time was associated with a higher incidence of postoperative stroke (4.5% vs. 2.5%, p < .001), and dialysis (16.4% vs. 10.6%, p < .001). Prolonged preservation was associated with a greater likelihood of death from primary graft dysfunction (2.8% vs. 1.5%, p < .001) but there was no difference in death from acute (2.0% vs. 1.7%, p = .402) or chronic rejection (2.0% vs. 1.9%, p = .618). In transplanted patients with >5 h of heart preservation, multivariable analysis identified greater mortality with ischemic cardiomyopathy etiology (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.36, p < 0.01), pre-transplant dialysis (HR = 1.84, p < .01), pre-transplant extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, HR = 2.36, p = .09), and O blood type donor hearts (HR = 1.35, p < .01). Preservation time >5 h is associated with worse survival. This mortality risk is further amplified by preoperative dialysis and ECMO, ischemic cardiomyopathy etiology, and use of O blood type donor hearts.
