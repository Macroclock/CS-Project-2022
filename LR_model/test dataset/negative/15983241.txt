Bcl-xL gene transfer inhibits Bax translocation and prolongs cardiac cold preservation time in rats. Apoptosis is an important cause of early graft loss after heart transplantation. Bcl-xL was reported to protect the heart against normothermic ischemia and reperfusion injury. In this study, we determined whether overexpression of Bcl-xL could inhibit tissue injury resulting from prolonged cold preservation followed by warm reperfusion of heart transplants. Lewis rat hearts were transduced with an adenovirus vector harboring Bcl-xL cDNA (AxCAhBclxL) 4 days before collection of tissue. After preservation in University of Wisconsin solution at 4 degrees C for 24 hours, the heart was either perfused with a Langendorff device ex vivo or used for heterotopic heart transplantation in vivo. Bcl-xL gene transfer significantly reduced the infarct size (23.0+/-2.6% versus 47.7+/-7.0% in saline control and 48.6+/-6.1% in vector control, P<0.01) after 2-hour reperfusion at 37 degrees C with the Langendorff device and significantly decreased creatine kinase release (0.82+/-0.27 IU, versus 1.57+/-0.33 and 1.50+/-0.37 IU in saline and vector controls, respectively; P<0.05). In heart transplantation, overexpression of Bcl-xL inhibited Bax translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria, resulting in decreased cytochrome c release from the mitochondria; it also significantly decreased cardiac cell apoptosis and improved graft survival rate after long cold preservation, followed by warm reperfusion. Bcl-xL gene transfer inhibited the translocation of Bax and prolonged the cold preservation time of cardiac transplants. This may be a potential therapeutic method in clinical practice.
