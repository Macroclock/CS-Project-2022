Radiological and clinical findings of pulmonary aspergillosis following solid organ transplant. To evaluate the radiological and clinical findings in patients with pulmonary aspergillosis after solid organ transplantation. This study included 13 consecutive patients (five liver, four kidney, and four heart transplant; 10 male and three female; median age 54 years; range 13-63 years) with histologically confirmed pulmonary aspergillosis after solid organ transplantation at a tertiary referral hospital. Chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) examinations performed for diagnosis were available in all patients. Radiological findings, such as lesion characteristics, location, and associated findings, were assessed retrospectively by two radiologists. The changes in radiological findings and clinical response after treatment were also assessed. Clinical findings, such as time of onset, initial symptoms, clinical course, and laboratory findings, were reviewed. The most common radiographic and CT findings were pulmonary nodules or masses (n=12). The number of nodules or masses was less than 10 in eight patients. Associated findings were surrounding ground-glass opacity (n=4), central low density (n=8), central air cavity (n=5), and air bronchogram (n=3). Follow-up radiographs and/or CT after treatment showed improvement in eight patients, persistence in two, and deterioration in three. The onset time of pulmonary aspergillosis was a median of 32 days (range 15-165 days). The most common symptom at diagnosis was fever (n=6). Ten of 13 patients did not have leucopaenia. There were two aspergillosis-associated deaths during the follow-up period. The most common radiological finding of pulmonary aspergillosis after solid organ transplantation is multiple nodules or masses, which commonly appear within 1 month following transplantation.
