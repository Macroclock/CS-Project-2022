The Impella 2.5 L for percutaneous mechanical circulatory support in severe humoral allograft rejection. Heart transplant recipients who experience humoral rejection are at risk for hemodynamic instability. We report a case of a 64-year-old male with cardiogenic shock due to allograft rejection requiring mechanical support while undergoing intense immunosuppression. He underwent implantation of a micro-axial endovascular pump (Impella). To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of successful Impella device deployment as a bridge-to-recovery strategy.
