Heart transplantation from donors with left ventricular ejection fraction under forty percent. Heart transplantation (HTx) remains the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage advanced heart failure. In 2016, the Shumakov National Medical Research Center commenced performing HTx from donors with abnormal left ventricular systolic function (LVEF < 40%). The aim of this study was to evaluate early and late outcomes of recipients after HTx from donors with abnormal LV systolic function. Four hundred eighty seven patients underwent HTx in our institution from January 2016 to December 2018. 27 (5.5%) patients were transplanted using cardiac allografts from donors with LVEF <40%. A total of 47 donors with LVEF <40% were evaluated for potential donation. Most heart donors revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction ranging between 30% and 40%. Twenty-five recipients required urgent HTx. Four recipients presented with early allograft dysfunction. All surviving recipients demonstrated early (85.2%) or delayed (14.8%) recovery of systolic function (LVEF > 60%). The use of dysfunctional donor hearts with impaired LV systolic function may be a realistic approach for expanding the donor pool. However, organs from such donors should be used for recipient cohorts requiring an urgent HTx, particularly for those with pretransplant mechanical circulatory support allowing for hemodynamic support in cases of early graft dysfunction in the post-transplant period.
