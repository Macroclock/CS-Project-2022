Alterations in the Nucleocytoplasmic Transport in Heart Transplant Rejection. Nucleocytoplasmic transport is a crucial process for cell function. Previous studies have observed alterations in different molecules involved in it, relating them to ventricular function. However, there are no published data evaluating possible differences in the expression of these molecules in heart transplantation (HT) recipients. Our objective is to evaluate whether its levels are related to the appearance of cellular rejection (CR) during the first year after HT. A prospective clinical cohort that included patients undergoing HT between January 2017 and January 2019 (n = 46). Blood samples for the analysis of importin 5 (IMP5), nucleoporin 153 (Nup153); RAN-GTPaseAP1 (RanGAP1), and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (ATP-aseCaTransp) were collected approximately 2 months post-HT. The levels obtained were correlated with the incidence of at least moderate CR during the first year of follow-up. Results showed that 17.39% of the patients had at least moderate CR during the first year of follow-up. Higher levels of IMP5, Nup153, and RanGAP1 were observed in this group. This difference was statistically significant in the case of Nup153 and RanGAP1 (15.94 ± 14.00 vs 28.62 ± 23.61, P = .048; 21.95 ± 15.97 vs 40.90 ± 27.16, P = .026, respectively); there was an opposite trend in the ATP-aseCaTransp case. Patients with at least a moderate degree of CR during follow-up showed higher serum levels of IMP5, Nup153, and RanGAP1. The prognostic usefulness of the determination of these biomarkers and whether their elevation during follow-up would facilitate early, noninvasive identification of patients with CR remains to be clarified.
