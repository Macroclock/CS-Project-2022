Leadless Pacemaker Implant After Heart Transplant. Conduction abnormalities are known to occur after heart transplantation. In some cases, a permanent pacemaker is required.

We report what we believe is the first US case of a leadless pacemaker implant (specifically in a heart transplant recipient) with the longest reported duration of follow-up.
