Use of extracorporeal life support as a bridge to pediatric cardiac transplantation. Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) has been used for post-cardiotomy rescue, but its use as a bridge to heart transplantation (OHT) in patients with post-surgical or end-stage ventricular failure remains controversial. Records were reviewed for patients receiving ECLS for ventricular failure from January 1991 to August 2001. Patients listed for OHT were analyzed separately. Listing for OHT requirements were improbable myocardial recovery, absence of contraindications (central nervous system damage, high pulmonary resistance, ongoing infection, etc.), and parental consent. Outcome variables included patient demographics, diagnosis, days from ECLS initiation to United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) listing (latency), list time, renal function, and survival to discharge. Of 145 patients with ventricular failure who received ECLS, 21 pediatric patients were UNOS listed. Of 124 non-listed patients, 57 (46%) survived to discharge. All but 3 survivors were separated from ECLS in </=7 days. Twelve underwent OHT and 10 survived to discharge (list time, 6 days; median ECLS time, 14 days). Five had ECLS discontinued without undergoing OHT (1 later underwent OHT, 2 survived to discharge). Five experienced complications while receiving ECLS and died without undergoing OHT. Six of 9 patients who required dialysis for renal failure died. Of 11 infants listed, 4 were weaned from ECLS without undergoing OHT (2 survived to discharge), 5 had OHT (ECLS support, 4 days; 4 survived to discharge) and 2 died (ECLS support, 16 and 47 days). (1) Extracorporeal life support can be used as a bridge to OHT (even among the infant population) for at least 2 weeks with acceptable survival and hospital discharge rates, and (2) renal insufficiency with the concomitant requirement for dialysis decreases the likelihood of survival before and after OHT.
