[Risk of heart failure diminished thanks to stomach reduction in obesity]. Obesity is a chronic disease and a risk factor for heart failure. In end-stage heart failure, heart transplantation may be the only available treatment option, but obesity is a contraindication for this treatment because of its unfavourable prognosis. Bariatric surgery and its subsequent weight loss may affect the indication for transplantation in patients with heart failure and morbid obesity. A 46-year-old patient with morbid obesity and heart failure underwent gastric sleeve resection in preparation of a heart transplantation. Without it, he would not have been considered eligible for transplantation because of his obesity. The bariatric intervention was also intended to use weight loss as a way to reduce the symptoms of his heart failure and to make rehabilitation possible. One year after surgery, the condition of the patient had improved so much that heart transplantation was no longer necessary. Bariatric surgery is safe for morbidly obese patients with severe heart failure and may sometimes even avoid heart transplantation.
