[Arterial hypertension after heart transplantation]. Aim To evaluate incidence of arterial hypertension (AH) in the posttransplantation period and to identify risk factors for this complication.Materials and methods From January, 2010 through December, 2017, 96 heart transplantations (HT) (70 men and 26 women aged 46.5Â±13.9 years) were performed. During the first month following HT, 8 recipients died and were excluded from the analysis. The retrospective evaluation of results included 88 patients followed up for more than one year.Results For the entire post-HT period (maximum 92 months), AH was observed in 75 of 88 (85%) recipients. Post-HT AH was correlated with male gender (r=0.24; p=0.031), history of smoking before HT (r=0.45; p&lt;0.001), history of ischemic heart disease (IHD) (r=0.28; p=0.01), older age (r=0.35; p=0.001), higher body weight index (r=0.37; p=0.0005), creatinine level (r=0.37; p=0.001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (r=0.27; p=0.04). Interrelations with other AH risk factors were not found. Most patients developed AH within the first two years after HT. During the first year, AH was diagnosed in 60% (53 of 88) of patients (relapse, 85% (n=29); newly diagnosed, 45% (n=24), p=0.0003). At two years, AH was detected in 79% (46 of 58) of patients (relapse, 53% (n=18); newly diagnosed, 53% (n=28), p=0.9). All recipients received an adequate antihypertensive therapy. 40-63% of patients required a single-drug therapy at different points of follow-up; from 29 to 45% of patients required a two-drug therapy, and 5-15% of patients required three or more drugs. During all 5 years of treatment, most patients used angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (70-87%) and slow calcium channel blockers (SCCB) (48-53%). The presence of AH following HT was associated with development of all cardiovascular events (CVE; r=0.31; p=0.012) whereas persistent AH, which required a combination antihypertensive treatment, was associated with a high mortality (r=0.61; p=0.015).Conclusion AH is a frequent complication of HT (85%), which is newly diagnosed in most patients during the first two years. AH incidence was higher for male recipients with a history of IHD, hypertension, and smoking. Approximately half of patients required only a single-drug antihypertensive therapy. After HT, the most frequently prescribed drugs included ACE inhibitors or ARBs and SCCBs (70-87% and 48-53%, respectively, depending on the time elapsed after HT). Persistent AH requiring a treatment with two or more antihypertensive drugs was associated with development of all CVEs and a higher long-term mortality.
