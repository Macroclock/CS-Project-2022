[Investigation of sexual function rehabilitation of 11 male heart transplant recipients]. To investigate the rehabilitation of the sexual function of male patients after heart transplantation. Eleven discharged adult male cardiac transplant recipients (ranging 32-54 years) with a normally functioning allograft for at least 9 months were questioned on their pre- and post-operative sexual function. All the recipients complained of a significant pretransplantive decrease and 10 stated a significant posttransplantive increase in sexual function. The sexual function of the male recipients was significantly improved after cardiac transplantation. Psychosocial factors affecting the rehabilitation of sexual function should not be neglected.
