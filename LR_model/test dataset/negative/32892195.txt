Prognostic Value of Biomarkers in Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy following Heart Transplantation: A Literature Review. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), also known as cardiac transplant vasculopathy, is a major determinant of long-term survival among cardiac transplantation recipients. Histologically, CAV is featured by diffuse, concentric thickening of the vascular wall, and primarily affects large and small epicardial coronary arteries, intramyocardial arteries, and veins. Owing to graft denervation, CAV typically follows an insidious course, and patients may not experience classic angina symptoms but instead present with progressive heart failure or ventricular arrhythmias. Recent studies on biomarkers have furthered the knowledge concerning the prediction and prognosis of CAV. Given its association with metabolic, thrombotic, inflammatory, and immunologic markers, CAV is likely to represent a complex multifactorial process that involves both immune-mediated and non-immune-mediated pathways. In order to identify the high-risk patients that would benefit from early intervention, future research is warranted to examine the usefulness of a biomarker panel in CAV risk stratification.
