Successful cardiac resynchronization therapy after heart transplantation. We describe a case of a 56-year-old male patient, who developed refractory dilated cardiomyopathy 5 years after heart transplantation. An atriobiventricular pacemaker was implanted when indication criteria of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) were seen. The intraventricular dyssynchrony was significant before CRT, while synchronous contraction was demonstrated later with the beneficial reverse remodelling of the left ventricle. Resynchronization therapy resulted in significant improvement of the patient's clinical parameters. The success of this therapy points out the possible role of CRT in the treatment of chronic allograft failure after heart transplantation.
