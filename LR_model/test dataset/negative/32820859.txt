Anti-hypertensive treatment in the immediate post-operative period and 1 year after pediatric heart transplantation. Hypertension is a known complication of pediatric heart transplantation. We sought to identify factors associated with anti-hypertensive use in pediatric heart transplant recipients immediately post-transplant and oral anti-hypertensive use at discharge and 1-year post-transplant. Retrospective chart review was conducted of patients ≤18 years who underwent heart transplantation at two major heart transplant centers between August 1, 2009 and December 31, 2017 with ≥1-year follow-up. Exclusion criteria included re-transplant, multi-organ recipients, survival <1 year, and comorbidities associated with hypertension. Anti-hypertensive use was recorded during initial ICU stay, at discharge, and 1-year post-transplant. Univariate and multivariate analyses determined associations of demographic and diagnostic factors and need for anti-hypertensives. There were 188 patients that met inclusion criteria. Anti-hypertensive infusions were required in the ICU post-transplant in 46 patients (24.5%) for a median of 3 days (1-21 days). Oral anti-hypertensives were required in 58 patients (30.9%) at discharge and 1-year post-transplant. Anti-hypertensive infusion in the ICU post-transplant was associated with donor-to-recipient weight ratio. Oral anti-hypertensive use at discharge was associated with weight ratio and pretransplant VAD use, and at 1-year, post-transplant was associated with age at transplant, steroid use at discharge, and oral anti-hypertensive use at discharge. Hypertension is common immediately following and 1-year post-transplant. Weight ratio was the only independent predictor of anti-hypertensive use in the early post-transplant period, whereas VAD use was also associated with anti-hypertensive use at discharge. Anti-hypertensive use 1-year post-transplant was not associated with those factors, but rather with age at transplant and steroid use. 'heart transplant', 'hypertension', 'pediatric'
