A case of conversion of a NIPRO ventricular assist system to an EVAHEART left ventricular assist system. Bridge to bridge (BTB) is a promising strategy for the treatment of end-stage heart failure that involves the left ventricular assist system (LVAS). We describe our experience with the conversion of an extracorporeal ventricular assist system (VAS), the NIPRO VAS, to an implantable LVAS, the EVAHEART LVAS. A 32-year-old man underwent a NIPRO VAS implantation as a bridge to decision for a condition consistent with Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support profile 1. He was later diagnosed with secondary cardiomyopathy due to cardiac sarcoidosis. During the period in which he had NIPRO VAS support, no significant bacterial cultures were obtained from the cannula-piercing site, and no systemic infection occurred. Approximately 5 months after the NIPRO VAS implantation, he underwent an EVAHEART LVAS implantation as a BTB. The procedure required technical modifications, including the anastomosis of outflow grafts, trimming of the apical cuff, and creation of a pump pocket. The operation was completed uneventfully. The patient completed the discharge program for awaiting heart transplantation at home. Approximately 6 months after the EVAHEART LVAS implantation, he continues to do well without any complications, including infection, and visits our hospital as an outpatient. Conversion to an implantable LVAS can be beneficial in carefully selected patients after ascertaining the operative indications and operation timing.
