Clinical outcomes in pediatric patients implanted with Thoratec ventricular assist device. Most mechanical circulatory support devices are designed for adult patients; however, some can be successfully applied to pediatric patients. The rates of complications and patient survival to transplant or native heart recovery after implantation of the Thoratec ventricular assist device (VAD) (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA) in children and adolescents were determined from the company's voluntary registry. As of January 2005, 209 patients (mean age 14.5 years; range 5 to 18 years) have been supported with the Thoratec VAD. Mean patient weight was 57 kg (range, 17 to 118 kg), and patients had a mean body surface area of 1.6 m2 (range, 0.73 to 2.3 m2). The major etiologies necessitating VAD support included cardiomyopathy (55.0%), acute myocarditis (25.4%), and end-stage congenital heart disease (5.8%). Mean duration of VAD support was 44 days (range, 0 to 434 days). Patient survival to transplantation or native heart recovery was 68.4%. Patients with cardiomyopathy and acute myocarditis had 74.1% and 86.0% survival, respectively, with only 27.3% survival in patients having congenital heart disease. The overall survival rate in smaller children (body surface area, <1.3 m2) was similar at 51.7%, although the incidence of congenital heart disease was higher.
