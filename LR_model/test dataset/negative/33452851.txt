Association between cytomegalovirus infection and allograft rejection in a large contemporary cohort of heart transplant recipients. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a common complication after heart transplantation (HTx). The association between CMV infection and allograft rejection is debated in the era of efficient prophylactic antiviral therapies. This single-center cohort study utilized a highly phenotyped database of HTx recipients (2012-2016). The primary endpoint was the analysis of the association between CMV infection (CMV load ≥ 500 IU/mL whole blood) and the risk of allograft rejection (cellular rejection ≥ 1R1B, antibody-mediated rejection ≥ pAMR1). Secondary endpoints included the analysis of a higher CMV load threshold (≥10 000 IU/mL) and different risk periods after PCR positivity. A mixed-effect logistic regression model with a random intercept was applied. Results were adjusted for important risk factors of rejection. Overall, 384 patients were included and 6388 CMV loads and 3,494 endomyocardial biopsies were analyzed. CMV infections ≥ 500 IU/mL were diagnosed on 1223 (19.2%) blood samples from 284 (72.1%) patients and allograft rejections on 246 biopsies (7%) from 149 patients (38.8%). We did not find any association between CMV infection ≥ 500 IU/mL and rejection (univariable: OR 0.94, 95% CI [0.61, 1.45], P = .78, multivariable: OR 0.86, 95% CI [0.55, 1.33], P = .85). These results were consistent when analyzing a higher CMV load threshold and different periods of risk, reinforced by internal validation procedures and a posteriori calculation of the power (primary endpoint: power = 0.82, 95% CI [0.79-0.84]) and reproducible across different clinical scenarios. CMV infection was not associated with an increased risk of rejection in a contemporary cohort of HTx recipients. 'allograft rejection', 'cytomegalovirus', 'heart transplantation', 'risk factor'
