Over 1200-day support with dual Jarvik 2000 biventricular assist device. We report the successful longest biventricular support using dual Jarvik 2000 biventricular assist device (BVAD; Jarvik Heart, Inc., New York, NY, USA) as a bridge to transplant. A 27-year old woman with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy underwent implantation of two Jarvik 2000s as a left ventricular assist device and right ventricular assist device. Although several BVAD-related complications including haemolysis, hepatic dysfunction, heart failure and pulmonary valve insufficiency developed at a very late stage, she was successfully bridged to heart transplantation after 1245 days of biventricular support, which is the longest in the literature. Despite advances in continuous-flow ventricular assist devices, their long-term use for biventricular support remains limited. We report a successful case of 1245 days of biventricular support with dual Jarvik 2000 axial flow pumps in a patient with a small body surface area.
