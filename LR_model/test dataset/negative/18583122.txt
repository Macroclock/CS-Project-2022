Donor heart preservation with iloprost supplemented St. Thomas Hospital cardioplegic solution in isolated rat hearts. This study was designed to assess the influence of St. Thomas Hospital cardioplegic solution (St. Th.) on heart preservation in rat hearts subjected to 6h ischemia when supplemented with iloprost. In the control group (n=8), nothing was added to St. Th., whereas 10 or 1000 nmol L(-1) iloprost was added in the second (n=7) and third (n=8) groups, respectively. Mechanical contraction parameters, cardiac tissue damage and oxidative stress markers were evaluated. The 10 nmol/L iloprost group peak systolic pressure (71.0+/-30.9 versus 41.0+/-9.4 mm Hg) and -dp/dtmax (1103.8+/-94.3 versus 678.6+/-156.8 mm Hg s(-1)) were significantly higher than control group at 30 min of reperfusion (p<0.05). Iloprost supplemented groups had higher GSH and catalase levels of coronary perfusate at reperfusion, in comparison with initial values (p<0.05). AST, CK, CK-MB values increased at 0 min of reperfusion and cTnI values at 45 min of reperfusion (p<0.05) in all groups with no difference between groups. According to our results, iloprost supplementation had mild but significant improvement in postischemic values in mechanical and oxidative stress parameters, resulting in better heart preservation.
