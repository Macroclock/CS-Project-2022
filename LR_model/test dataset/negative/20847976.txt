Cardiac sarcoidosis: recurrent disease in a heart transplant patient following pulmonary tuberculosis infection. Cardiac transplantation is indicated for patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy secondary to cardiac sarcoidosis. Although rare, recurrent disease has been reported in two cases. The current report presents a case of recurrent cardiac sarcoidosis in a patient 45 months postorthotopic heart transplantation and 40 months following reactivation of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The patient was the first to have recurrent disease following an infection that has been proposed to be involved in its pathogenesis. The patient's interval between transplant and recurrence is the longest reported to date.
