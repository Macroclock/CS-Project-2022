Update in HIV infection in organ transplantation. With reductions in AIDS-related mortality, patients with HIV infection are dying and experiencing significant morbidity from end-stage organ disease. However, patients infected with HIV have traditionally been excluded from organ transplantation. Recent advances have had a significant impact on the potential transplant candidacy of these patients. This review will highlight the major issues associated with transplantation in individuals who are infected with HIV. Recently published studies showing promising preliminary outcomes among transplant recipients with HIV infection, suggest that it is not any more justifiable to deny transplantation based solely on HIV-infection status. These studies consistently describe stable HIV disease following liver and kidney transplantation. Furthermore, combined pancreas-kidney, heart, and lung transplantation has been successfully reported, although in a much smaller number of patients. Despite these scientific and policy advances, many healthcare providers and patients remain unaware of ongoing progress in this field. The experience with organ transplantation in HIV-infected patients is evolving and successful outcomes have been observed when specific criteria are used to select candidates.
