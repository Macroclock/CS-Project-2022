[Ablation of ventricular tachycardia in a patient with a left ventricular assist device]. The use of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as a bridge to heart transplantation (HTx) or as a destination therapy in patients with a contraindication for HTx is increasing. However, nearly half of the patients with LVAD support experience a ventricular arrhythmia (VA) in the first year. The history of a pre-LVAD VA is one of the most powerful predictors of VA after LVAD implantation. The clinical experience and data about ablation of a VA in patients with an LVAD are limited. There are important issues to be considered before and during the procedure in LVAD patients compared to other VA ablation patients. This is a report of ablation of intractable ventricular tachycardia in a patient with a LVAD.
