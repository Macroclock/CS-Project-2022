Trends in the use of mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to heart transplantation across different age groups. Numerous cohort analyses suggest rapidly increasing use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) as a bridge to heart transplantation (HTx), but the role of age in selection for MCS remains unknown. We assessed adult HTx in the International Society for Heart And Lung Transplantation Registry between 2005 and 2013 and we determined MCS use by recipient age group and transplant year. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to identify variables associated with continuous flow (CF) left ventricular assist device (LVAD) use within each age group. Among 16,480 HTx recipients the percentage of overall MCS use increased from 23% to 38%, 21% to 41%, and 17% to 42% in age groups 18-39 years, 40-59 years and over 60 years, respectively. This effect was mainly due to an increase in CF LVAD use and primarily in HTx recipients aged over 60. In multivariable analyses, male gender and blood group O were significantly associated with CF LVAD use in all age groups. Bridge to transplant MCS use increased dramatically between 2005 and 2013 primarily due to increased use of CF LVAD and primarily in higher ages. Pre-HTx CF LVAD use was more frequent in men and blood group O. 'Continuous flow left ventricular assist device', 'Heart failure', 'Heart transplantation', 'Mechanical circulatory support'
