There is speculation that lung grafts protect the heart from developing graft vasculopathy after combined heart-lung transplantation. This protective mechanism is more likely, at best, a delay in the onset of coronary artery vasculopathy. We present our experiences in two cases of an aggressive form of cardiac allograft vasculopathy after combined heart-lung transplantation that resulted in the death of both patients.
