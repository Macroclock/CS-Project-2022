Impact of asymptomatic acute cellular rejection on left ventricle myocardial function evaluated by means of two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography in heart transplant recipients. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of asymptomatic acute cellular rejection (ACR) in left ventricular myocardial strain in heart transplant (HT) recipients by means of two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2DSTE). From September 1, 2009 to December 15, 2010 a conventional echocardiography and 2DSTE exam was performed on all consecutive HT recipients in their first year posttransplantation within 3 hours of the surveillance endomyocardial biopsies, as well as on 14 healthy controls. The association of strain echocardiographic variables with different grades of ACR was investigated. Of the 78 studies performed 4 ± 3 months after HT in 20 patients, 32 studies were coincident with grade 0R rejection, 41 with grade 1R, and 5 with grade 2R. Significantly lower values of average radial strain were found with higher grades of ACR (29.1 ± 7.7%, 23.2 ± 8.5%, and 14.3 ± 8.8% for grades 0R, 1R, and 2R of ACR, P = 0.001). Average deformation was similar for controls versus transplanted patients, in the absence of acute rejection: radial 29.1 ± 10.0% versus 29.1 ± 7.7%, P = 0.98; circumferential -19.3 ± 3.2% versus -20.2 ± 5.9%, P = 0.62; and longitudinal -20.7 ± 4.1% versus -18.5 ± 5.4%, P = 0.19. An average radial strain <25% presented 100% sensitivity, 48% specificity, 6% positive predictive value, and 100% negative predictive value for the presence of 2R rejection (area under the curve 0.80, IC 95% 0.60-0.99, P = 0.048). In this study, HT recipients showed significantly lower values of average radial left ventricle strain, evaluated by means of 2DSTE, with the presence of ACR.
