DEPTOR modulates activation responses in CD4 DEPTOR is an evolutionarily conserved cell-intrinsic binding partner of mTOR that functions as a negative regulator of signaling responses. In this study, we show that DEPTOR is expressed within CD4 'T cell biology', 'basic (laboratory) research / science', 'immune regulation', 'immunobiology', 'immunosuppression/immune modulation', 'lymphocyte biology', 'rejection', 'tolerance'
