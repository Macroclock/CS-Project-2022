Relation of Peripheral Venous Pressure to Central Venous Pressure in Patients With Heart Failure, Heart Transplant, and Left Ventricular Assist Device. Peripheral venous pressure (PVP) monitoring is a noninvasive method to assess volume status. We investigated the correlation between PVP and central venous pressure (CVP) in heart failure (HF), heart transplant (HTx), and left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients undergoing right heart catheterization (RHC). A prospective, cross-sectional study examining PVP in 100 patients from October 2018 to January 2020 was conducted. The analysis included patients undergoing RHC admitted for HF, post-HTx monitoring, or LVAD hemodynamic testing. Sixty percent of patients had HF, 30% were HTx patients, and 10% were LVAD patients. The mean PVP was 9.4 ± 5.3 mm Hg, and the mean CVP was 9.2 ± 5.8 mm Hg. The PVP and CVP were found to be highly correlated (r = 0.93, p < 0.00001). High correlation was also noted when broken down by HF (r = 0.93, p < 0.00001), HTx (r = 0.93, p < 0.00001), and LVAD groups (r = 0.94, p < 0.00005). In conclusion, there is a high degree of correlation between PVP and CVP in HF, HTx, and LVAD patients. PVP measurements can be used as a rapid, reliable, noninvasive estimate of volume status in these patient populations.
