Can we accept donors who have suffered a resuscitated cardiac arrest? The shortage of donor organs has prompted increased acceptance of hearts from donors with more comorbidities. With increasing frequency, hearts are being offered from patients who have undergone a resuscitated cardiac arrest (RCA). Our aim was to compare the rate of complications in the postoperative and follow-up periods, depending on whether the transplanted organ came from a donor who had undergone an RCA. We included all 604 heart transplantations (HTs) performed in our center from 1987 to 2009, including 25 recipients who received an organ from a donor who had undergone RCA. We considered RCA to be an in-hospital cardiac arrest that was resuscitated from the onset, with a duration of <30 minutes, and with total recovery of cardiac and hemodynamic function. We analyzed ischemia time, incidence of acute graft failure (AGF), intubation period, recovery room stay, and long-term survival. The statistical methods were Student t and chi-square tests. There were no differences in baseline characteristics, except that patients in the RCA group were younger (47±13 vs 51±11 years; P=.50). There were also no differences between the RCA group and the other patients in ischemia time (151±50 vs 154±53 minutes; P=.826), incidence of AGF (33% vs 24.7%; P=.311), hours of intubation (76±204 vs 72±249; P=.926), days of recovery room stay (6±7 vs 8±6; P=.453), or survival after HT (53±54 vs 53±52 months; P=.982). Patients receiving a heart from a patient with an in-hospital RCA and subsequent hemodynamic stability have a similar outcomes to other HT patients.
