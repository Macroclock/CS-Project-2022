Cardiac Structure-Function MRI in Patients After Heart Transplantation. Following heart transplantation (Tx), recipients are closely monitored using endomyocardial biopsy, which is limited by cost and invasiveness, and echocardiography, which is limited regarding detailed structural and functional evaluation. To test the feasibility of comprehensive structure-function cardiac MRI as a noninvasive modality to assess changes in myocardial structure and function. Prospective. MR was performed in 61 heart transplant recipients (age 47.9 ± 16.3 years, 39% female) and 14 age-matched healthy controls (age 47.7 ± 16.7 years, 36% female). 1.5T; 2D CINE steady state free precession (SSF)P imaging, T Quantification of myocardial T Comparisons between transplant recipients and controls were performed using independent samples t-tests. Relationships between structural (T T MR techniques are sensitive to structural and functional differences in transplant recipients compared to controls.
