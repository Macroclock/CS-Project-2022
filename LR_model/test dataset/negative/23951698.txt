Malignant transformation of respiratory papillomatosis in a solid-organ transplant patient: case report and literature review. We report the case of a 77-year-old non-smoker and non-drinker with a solid-organ transplant who had malignant transformation of respiratory papillomatosis 3 years after the initial diagnosis of this benign lesion. This is the first case reported in the literature of malignant transformation of respiratory papillomatosis in a solid-organ transplant patient. Virus-associated cutaneous cancers occur more frequently and aggressively in solid-organ transplant patients. There may be a higher rate of malignant transformation of respiratory papillomatosis in immunosuppressed patients, as this is a virus-associated disease. Closer observation, airway evaluation with laryngoscopy and tracheobronchoscopy, and interval biopsies of immunosuppressed patients with respiratory papillomatosis is recommended.
