Berberine Promotes Induction of Immunological Tolerance to an Allograft via Downregulating Memory CD8 Emerging evidence has linked the gut microbiota dysbiosis to transplant rejection while memory T-cells pose a threat to long-term transplant survival. However, it's unclear if the gut microbiome alters the formation and function of alloreactive memory T-cells. Here we studied the effects of berberine, a narrow-spectrum antibiotic that is barely absorbed when orally administered, on the gut microbiota, memory T-cells, and allograft survival. In this study, C57BL/6 mice transplanted with islets or a heart from BALB/c mice were treated orally with berberine. Allograft survival was observed, while spleen, and lymph node T-cells from recipient mice were analyzed using a flow cytometer. High-throughput sequencing and qPCR were performed to analyze the gut microbiota. CD8 'allograft rejection', 'berberine', 'gut microbiota', 'immunological tolerance', 'memory T cell'
