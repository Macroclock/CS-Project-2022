Pediatric heart transplantation: 23-year single-center experience. Early and late mortality have significantly improved during recent decades in pediatric patients after heart transplantation (HTx). Nevertheless early and late morbidity and mortality are influenced by acute rejection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), malignancy, renal failure, and graft failure. We evaluated our results after HTx in children under the age of 18 years with 23 years of follow-up. Perioperative characteristics, probability of survival, and time-related morbidity were retrospectively analyzed. We included 169 pediatric HTx recipients, transplanted between 05/1986 and 05/2010. One hundred and one were males with a median age of 8.7 (0.02-23.2) years at the time of HTx. Main preoperative diagnoses were cardiomyopathy (CMP) (n = 139) with a median survival of 7.0 (0-23.2) years and congenital heart disease (CHD) (n = 30), median survival 11.3 (0-19.9) years. Overall survival at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years was 87%, 76%, 68%, and 50%, respectively. Patient survival was significantly reduced in patients with 0-1 year at the time of HTx versus 1-10 and 11-18 years: 2.3 (0-13.2) years versus 1-10 years = 8.6 (0-23.2) years; 11-18 years = 5.9 (0.003-18.5) years. Fifty-one patients were on mechanical circulatory support as a bridge-to-HTx with increased early but not late mortality. Ten patients underwent retransplant due to acute or chronic graft failure after a median posttransplant time of 12.25 (0.3-17.45) years. Late mortality was influenced by rejection, infection, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) (11.8%), or CAV with an incidence of 25% at 5 years, 50% at 10 years, and approximately 75% at 15 years. Pediatric HTx is a safe and effective treatment for terminal heart failure. In our experience, there is no adverse effect of previous cardiac assist device implantation in long-term follow-up. Virtually all anatomic malformations are amenable to orthotopic HTx. Significant progress has been achieved in controlling rejection through improved immunosuppression and noninvasive rejection monitoring.
