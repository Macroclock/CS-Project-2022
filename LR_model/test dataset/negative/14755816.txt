Long-term follow-up of brachytherapy for treatment of allograft in-stent restenosis. The experience of brachytherapy in the treatment of in-stent restenosis of allograft arteries is limited. We present two cases of in-stent restenosis treated with brachytherapy with favorable angiographic follow-up at 10 months in one patient and at 17 months in the other.
