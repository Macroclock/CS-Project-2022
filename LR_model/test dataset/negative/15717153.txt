Electroanatomical mapping and radiofrequency catheter ablation of atrial tachycardia originating from the recipient heart with recipient-to-donor atrio-atrial conduction after orthotopic heart transplantation. Atrial tachycardias resulting from recipient-to-donor atrio-atrial conduction after orthotopic heart transplantation are difficult to treat. We present two patients in whom atrial tachycardia originating in the recipient heart were successfully treated by radiofrequency ablation guided by electroanatomical CARTO mapping system. These cases illustrate that such atrial tachycardia are curable by radiofrequency ablation. Electroanatomical CARTO mapping is useful in identifying the site of origin of the tachycardia and the atrio-atrial conduction sites.
