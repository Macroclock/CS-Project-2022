Heart Transplant in Children: What a Primary Care Provider Needs to Know. Heart transplantation is offered to children with heart failure that is not amenable to medical or surgical therapy. Indications for heart transplant include unrepairable congenital heart disease, failed palliation of congenital heart disease, and cardiomyopathies. There has been tremendous progress in this field since the first heart transplant was performed in 1967. Each year, approximately 500 pediatric heart transplants take place worldwide. Pediatric heart transplant survivors are living longer with their initial transplant. Many pediatric practitioners are faced with caring for these patients before as well as after the heart transplant and, therefore, they should be knowledgeable about basic principles related to heart transplant. There are certain complications that are unique to this population, and medication side-effects, evaluation and management of a febrile illness, opportunistic infections, vaccination, pregnancy, and exercise recommendations are areas that require special consideration.
