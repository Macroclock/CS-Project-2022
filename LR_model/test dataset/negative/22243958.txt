Worsening dyspnea in a man with 2 hearts. We report a case of dyspnea in a 71-year-old man who underwent heterotopic heart transplantation in 2003. At presentation, electrocardiography showed ventricular fibrillation of the native heart and then a progression to both donor and recipient hearts. Synchronized electrical cardioversion restored sinus rhythm and relieved the patient from his symptoms.
