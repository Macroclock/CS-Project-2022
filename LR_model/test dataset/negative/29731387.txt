Challenges of immunosuppressive and antitrypanosomal drug therapy after heart transplantation in patients with chronic Chagas disease: A systematic review of clinical recommendations. Although contraindicated for decades, heart transplantation (HT) has finally become a feasible therapeutic option for the treatment of Chagasic patients with end-stage heart failure. Part of the success in achieving acceptable survival rates after HT is due to the enhancement of the pharmacological management of allograft rejection and reactivation of Trypanosoma cruzi infection. By using the framework of a systematic review, we investigated if Chagasic patients who have undergone a HT are treated with similar immunosuppressive and antitrypanosomal regimens in endemic and non-endemic countries and exhibits similar T. cruzi reactivation, allograft rejection and survival rates. From a structured search in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Sciences databases, 30 clinical studies were reviewed. Although immunosuppressive regimens are variable in endemic and non-endemic countries, the current evidence supports the administration of lower doses of corticosteroids, adjusted cyclosporine levels (100-150 ng/mL) 3 months after HT, and azathioprine rather than mycophenolate mofetil to reduce the risk of T. cruzi reactivation and rejection episodes. Antitrypanosomal therapy exclusively based on benznidazole, nifurtimox, and allopurinol was consistent in endemic and non-endemic countries, achieving effective results in the control of infection reactivation. The evidence that supports prophylactic antitrypanosomal therapy or administration of allopurinol alone is limited. By highlighting the main sources of research bias, we hope that our critical analysis can help to expedite clinical research and to reduce methodological bias, thereby improving the quality of evidence in new research initiatives.
