Impact of dose reductions on efficacy outcome in heart transplant patients receiving enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium or mycophenolate mofetil at 12 months post-transplantation. Mycophenolic acid (MPA) dose reduction is associated with increased risk of rejection and graft loss in renal transplantation. This analysis investigated the impact of MPA dose changes with enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in de novo heart transplant recipients. In a 12-month, single-blind trial, 154 patients (EC-MPS, 78; MMF, 76) were randomized to either EC-MPS (1080 mg bid) or MMF (1500 mg bid) in combination with cyclosporine and steroids. The primary efficacy variable was the incidence of treatment failure, comprising a composite of biopsy-proven (BPAR) and treated acute rejection, graft loss or death. Significantly fewer patients receiving EC-MPS required > or =2 dose reductions than patients on MMF (26.9% vs. 42.1% of patients, p = 0.048). Accordingly, the average daily dose of EC-MPS as a percentage of the recommended dose was significantly higher than for MMF (88.4% vs. 79.0%, p = 0.016). Among patients requiring > or =1 dose reduction, the incidence of treated BPAR grade > or =3A was significantly lower with EC-MPS compared with MMF (23.4% vs. 44.0%, p = 0.032). These data suggest that EC-MPS-treated heart transplant patients are less likely to require multiple dose reductions than those on MMF which may be associated with a significantly lower risk of treated BPAR > or =3A.
