Automated segmentation of biventricular contours in tissue phase mapping using deep learning. Tissue phase mapping (TPM) is an MRI technique for quantification of regional biventricular myocardial velocities. Despite its potential, clinical use is limited due to the requisite labor-intensive manual segmentation of cardiac contours for all time frames. The purpose of this study was to develop a deep learning (DL) network for automated segmentation of TPM images, without significant loss in segmentation and myocardial velocity quantification accuracy compared with manual segmentation. We implemented a multi-channel 3D (three dimensional; 2D + time) dense U-Net that trained on magnitude and phase images and combined cross-entropy, Dice, and Hausdorff distance loss terms to improve the segmentation accuracy and suppress unnatural boundaries. The dense U-Net was trained and tested with 150 multi-slice, multi-phase TPM scans (114 scans for training, 36 for testing) from 99 heart transplant patients (44 females, 1-4 scans/patient), where the magnitude and velocity-encoded (V 'deep learning (DL)', 'image segmentation', 'multi-channel 3D dense U-Net', 'tissue phase mapping (TPM)'
