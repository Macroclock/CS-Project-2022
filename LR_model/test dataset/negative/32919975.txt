Mitigating the Impact of Using Female Donor Hearts in Male Recipients Using BMI Difference. Heart transplantation is limited by the supply of donor organs. Previous studies have associated female donor to male recipient with decreased posttransplant survival. We wanted to evaluate whether this risk can be mitigated using higher donor than recipient body mass index (BMI). We performed a retrospective analysis of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/United Network of Organ Sharing registry encompassing years 2005 to 2018 for all male adult recipients (>18 years of age) who underwent isolated heart transplantation with grafts from female donors. The association between donor and recipient BMI difference and recipient survival was evaluated using adjusted Cox proportional hazards modeling. A total of 3788 male recipients who received female donor hearts met inclusion criteria for analysis. Maximally selected rank statistics identified donor minus recipient BMI of 1.5 kg/m Increasing donor BMI relative to recipient BMI up to 1.5 kg/m
