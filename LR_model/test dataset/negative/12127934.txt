Folate supplementation after heart transplantation: effects on homocysteine plasma levels and allograft vascular disease. After heart transplantation, the effects of folate supplementation on total homocysteine plasma levels (THcy) and heart allograft vascular disease (AVD) remain unclear. Accordingly, we prospectively analyzed 48 heart transplant receipients referred for routine follow-up from July to September 1998 (age 54+/-11 years, 75% male, 35+/-27 months from transplant). Among these patients, 17 were treated with folate supplementation for 12 months (Group F), while 31 cross-matched for age, gender, serum creatinine and time from transplant (P>0.3 vs Group F for all) did not assume folate supplementation (Group NF). Routine coronary angiography for AVD detection was routinely obtained in every patient. THcy overall increased during the study period (from 16.6+/-6.5 to 19.4+/-7.6 micromol/l, P<0.001), and a strong trend toward higher THcy was observed in patients presenting AVD (22.4+/-8.7 vs 17.6+/-6.8 micromol/l, P=0.051). After 12 months THcy was lower in Group F as compared to Group NF (16.2+/-5.6 vs 21.1+/-8.1 micromol/l, respectively, P=0.033). Our results demonstrate that THcy increases over time in heart transplant recipients, and a strong trend toward higher THcy is observed in the presence of AVD. Since folate supplementation appears to positively influence THcy, a favorable effect of folate on AVD can be hypothesized.
