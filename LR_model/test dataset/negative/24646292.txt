Mechanical embolectomy for ischemic stroke in a pediatric ventricular assist device patient. The reported incidence of cerebral embolic or hemorrhagic complications related to mechanical circulatory support in children is high, even while subjects are managed with aggressive antithrombotic therapy. The safety and utility of endovascular treatment for stroke in the pediatric VAD population has not been established in the published literature. We describe a nine-yr-old patient on BiVAD support who experienced threatened AIS on two separate occasions. He was treated successfully via mechanical embolectomy on both occasions and survived to transplantation with minimal neurologic deficits.
