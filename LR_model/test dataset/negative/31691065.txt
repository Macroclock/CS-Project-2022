Cavitation in left ventricular assist device patients: a potential early sign of pump thrombosis. Mechanical ventricular support with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has emerged as a durable and safe therapy, both as bridge-to-transplant (BTT) or destination therapy (DT), in patients with advanced heart failure (HF). However, the occurrence of pump thrombosis (PT) still represents a serious complication, especially when LVADs of first or second generation are implanted. During the latest years, some investigations have recognized the occurrence of cavitation, evidenced through transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), as a potential early and indirect sign of PT. In the present manuscript, we reviewed the available data on the occurrence of cavitation in LVAD patients as an early potential marker of PT, also presenting the hemodynamic mechanisms involved.
