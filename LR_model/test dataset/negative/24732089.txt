Superior vena cava obstruction after heart transplantation. Superior vena cava obstruction can be a serious complication after heart transplantation. A 58-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy underwent orthotopic bicaval heart transplantation. On the 12th postoperative day, one hour after removing the central venous line, he developed sudden onset of facial edema, cyanosis, and tachycardia. Emergency transesophageal echocardiography revealed superior vena caval thrombosis at the site of anastomosis. Considering the risks of surgical reexploration, the superior vena cava was recanalized by stent deployment. All of the patient's symptoms were relieved a few hours after stent placement.
