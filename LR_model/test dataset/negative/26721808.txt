Challenging Argatroban Management of a Child on Extracorporeal Support and Subsequent Heart Transplant. A 6-year-old child developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia while on extracorporeal life support. Hours after a difficult transition from heparin to argatroban for anticoagulation therapy, the child underwent heart transplantation. Intraoperative management was plagued with circuit thrombus formation while on cardiopulmonary bypass and subsequent massive hemorrhage after bypass. We review the child's anticoagulation management, clinical challenges encountered, and review current literature related to the use of argatroban in pediatric cardiac surgery.
