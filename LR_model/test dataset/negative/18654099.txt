No gender survival difference in a population of patients with chronic heart failure related to left ventricular systolic dysfunction and receiving optimal medical therapy. Controversial results have been published concerning a possible gender survival difference in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). We analysed data from consecutive patients with stable CHF admitted to our department for prognostic evaluation. Patients underwent coronary angiography, echo-cardiography, radionuclide angiography and a cardiopulmonary exercise test. We included 613 consecutive patients of whom 115 (19%) were women. The major difference in clinical characteristics was a higher proportion of ischaemic cardiomyopathy in men compared to women (51% vs 28%, p<0.0001) and a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (35+/-9 vs 38+/-9%, p=0.001). Therapeutic management was similar in men and women. A total of 140 cardiovascular-related deaths and 4 urgent transplantations occurred during a median follow-up of 1.234 days. There was no gender difference in cardiac survival. Cardiovascular mortality rates at 2 years were 11% in men and 13% in women. Despite a lower percentage of ischaemic cardiopathy in women, no gender survival benefit was found in our population of CHF patients receiving optimal medical therapy.
