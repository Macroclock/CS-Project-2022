Post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) localized in the central nervous system: report from an international survey on PTLD. Post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) localized to the central nervous system (CNS) is a rare but potentially fatal side-effect of immunosuppression for organ transplantation. Till now, to the best of our knowledge, the total number of such cases reported worldwide is less than 100. In this survey, we collected the data of PTLD localized to the CNS (CNS-PTLD) and compared this data with other PTLD patients with localizations to other areas serving as the control group. A comprehensive search was performed for studies reporting CNS-PTLD data in the Pubmed and Google scholar search engines. Finally, international data from 21 different studies were included in the analysis. Overall, 367 patients were entered into analysis. Organ recipients with CNS-PTLD had comparable gender make up, lymphoma cell types, Epstein-Barr virus infection rate, remission and mortality rates, with PTLD patients having other localizations. Multiorgan involvement as well as disseminated lymphoma were significantly more prevalent in the control group (P <0.05). At the last follow-up, 192 (60%) patients were dead (47 missing data). Irrespective of whether the overall death or only death due to PTLD was used as the final outcome, we found that the survival rates were similar for patients of the two groups (P = 0.895). Renal transplant recipients are at greater risk for developing CNS involvement by PTLD, while heart and liver recipients represent significant lower risks for the same. This study showed that PTLD patients who had CNS presentation have quite a comparable outcome compared with those with other areas of localization. However, further prospective studies are needed for reaffirming our findings.
