Axial flow blood pumps. Each year, thousands of cardiac patients await healthy donor hearts for transplantation. Due to the current shortage of donor hearts (approximately 2300 per year), these patients often require supplemental circulatory support until a transplant becomes available. This supplemental support is often provided by a mechanical heart pump or left ventricular assist device (LVAD). This article explores one type of LVAD, specifically the design and development of axial flow ventricular assist devices (VAD). We discuss the design details, and experimental or clinical experience with the following axial flow support systems: Hemopump, MicroMed DeBakey VAD, Jarvik 2000, HeartMate II, Streamliner, Impella, Berlin INCOR I, Valvo pump, and IVAP. All of these devices demonstrate promise in providing bridge-to-transplant and ultimately destination therapy for adult cardiac failure patients.
