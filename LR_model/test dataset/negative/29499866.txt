Donor tissue-specific exosome profiling enables noninvasive monitoring of acute rejection in mouse allogeneic heart transplantation. In heart transplantation, there is a critical need for development of biomarkers to noninvasively monitor cardiac allografts for immunologic rejection or injury. Exosomes are tissue-specific nanovesicles released into circulation by many cell types. Their profiles are dynamic, reflecting conditional changes imposed on their tissue counterparts. We proposed that a transplanted heart releases donor-specific exosomes into the recipient's circulation that are conditionally altered during immunologic rejection. We investigated this novel concept in a rodent heterotopic heart transplantation model. Full major histocompatibility mismatch (BALB/c [H2-K In the Maintenance arm, allografts were viable throughout follow-up of 30 days, with histology confirming absence of rejection or injury. Time course analysis (days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, and 30) showed that total plasma exosome concentration (P = .157) and donor heart exosome signal (P = .538) was similar between time points. In the Rejection arm, allografts were universally rejected (median, day 11). Total plasma exosome quantity and size distribution were similar between follow-up time points (P = .278). Donor heart exosome signals peaked on day 1, but significantly decreased by day 2 (P = 2 × 10 Transplant heart exosome profiling enables noninvasive monitoring of early acute rejection with high accuracy. Translation of this concept to clinical settings might enable development of a novel biomarker platform for allograft monitoring in transplantation diagnostics.
