Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support as a Bridge to Heart Transplant: Report of 3 Cases. Heart transplant is the only definitive treatment of end-stage heart failure. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be used as a bridge to heart transplant. Among 31 patients who underwent heart transplant between January 2014 and June 2016, we present our experiences with 3 patients who received venoarterial extracorporeal support as a bridge to heart transplant. The first patient was a 51-year-old male with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Transplant was performed after 6 days of extracorporeal support, and the patient was discharged and alive at follow-up. Patient 2 was a 12-yearold girl with dilated cardiomyopathy who presented with cardiac arrest. Extracorporeal support was initiated during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. She had full neurologic recovery and remained on the wait list. She received a transplant 22 days after resuscitation. She survived and was alive at day 220 posttransplant. The third patient was a 50-year-old male with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy requiring venoarterial extracorporeal support. Percutaneous balloon atrial septostomy was performed for left ventricle venting. He underwent transplant on day 28 after intensive care unit admission. He died 29 days after release from the hospital. Regarding patients on heart transplant wait lists who are worsening despite optimal medical therapy, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support is a safe and viable last resort.
