Survival time of cardiac allografts prolonged by isogeneic BMT in mice. To find an approach to prolong the survival time of cardiac allografts in a BALB/c-to-C57/BL6 heterotopic heart transplant model and to try to figure out related chemokines and cytokines, isogeneic and allogeneic BM cells were obtained from pregnant C57/BL6 (♀C57/BL6 × ♂BALB/c) and regular BALB/c mice and injected to the half lethally irradiated C57/BL6 mice 1 day before heart transplantation. Recipients were treated with CsA or phosphate-buffered saline for 7 days. Isogeneic BMT (iBMT) from pregnant C57/BL6 mice was observed to significantly prolong the survival of BALB/c allografts and reduce the lymphocyte infiltration. Allogeneic BMT (aBMT) and iBMT both exhibited signicantly less T-cell proliferation reactivity and the similar degree of chimerism. There was no significant difference in these groups of IFN-γ and IL-4 production. The level of chemokine MIG (CXCL9) dramatically decreased in aBMT and iBMT groups compared with the control group. But there were no significant differences between aBMT and iBMT group. IL-17 and RORγ(t) (receptor-related orphan receptor) production were downregulated in iBMT recipients. These results indicate that iBMT can prolong the survival of cardiac allografts. IL-17 production downregulated in iBMT recipients. This means that iBMT may have important therapeutic implications.
