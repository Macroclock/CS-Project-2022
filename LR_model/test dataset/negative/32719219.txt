Two cases of  Nocardiosis is an opportunistic infection occurring in immunosuppressed patients. While disseminated nocardiosis is common in immunosuppressed patients, Nocardia bacteraemia is rare. There are few reports of Nocardia bacteraemia following solid organ transplantation. We report two cases of Nocardia bacteraemia in solid organ transplant recipients-Nocardia cyriacigeorgica bacteraemia in liver transplant recipient and concomitant Nocardia farcinica bacteraemia and cyclosporiasis in a heart transplant recipient. Prompt recognition of early bacteraemia with initiation of antibiotic therapy may avoid the complications of disseminated disease in the solid organ transplant recipients.
