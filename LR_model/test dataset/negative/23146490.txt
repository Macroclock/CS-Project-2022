Opportunistic pulmonary infections in solid organ transplant recipients. Opportunistic pulmonary infections (OPI) represent common life-threatening complications after solid organ transplantation. Our objective was to describe pulmonary infections caused by opportunistic pathogens in solid-organ transplant patients. We analyzed all adult solid organ recipients (liver, heart, kidney, and pancreas) between July 2003 and June 2010, reporting all episodes of pulmonary opportunistic infection. During the study period, 1656 solid organ transplants were performed and 188 opportunistic infections were diagnosed in 163 patients (incidence 10%). In 40 cases, the site of infection was the lung (21%) with 57.5% occurring between the first and sixth month posttransplantation. The most frequently isolated microorganism was Aspergillus spp (n = 25, 63%), followed by Pneumocystis jirovecii (n = 6 cs, 15%). Twenty-five patients with an opportunistic pulmonary infections died during the follow-up including, 16 related to the infection (40%). The causative organism responsible for the highest mortality was Aspergillus spp (n = 12; 48%). Twenty-one patients with an opportunistic nonrespiratory infection died, five of them related to it (4%). Opportunistic pulmonary infection was associated with an increased mortality rate (P < .001). There was a trend toward a higher mortality among patients who developed OPI during the first 6 months after transplantation. Opportunistic pulmonary infections after solid organ transplantation are not infrequent. The period of risk for developing this infectious complications goes beyond the first 6 months posttransplantation. Mortality due to these infections was high in comparison to that of opportunistic nonrespiratory infections. It is important to keep a high index of suspicion for infectious complications during all posttransplant periods, as this is the first step toward a rapid diagnosis and adequate treatment.
