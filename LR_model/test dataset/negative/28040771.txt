Transplantation in a patient on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with infective endocarditis, pericarditis and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Heart failure patients with pacemaker or defibrillator-associated endocarditis in cardiogenic shock have few treatment options. We present a case of an INTERMACS I patient who developed device infection, sepsis, bacterial pericarditis and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The patient was stabilized with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and successfully transplanted. 'ECLS', 'heart transplantation', 'mechanical circulatory assistance', 'pericardium'
