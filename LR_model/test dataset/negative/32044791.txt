Aspergillus Osteomyelitis of the Scapula: A Case Report. A 52-year-old man known for a recent cardiac transplantation presented with 6 weeks of incapacitating left shoulder pain with normal x-rays and CT scans. MRI revealed bone edema of the coracoid and glenoid neck with a supraspinatus abscess. Biopsy of the coracoid demonstrated Aspergillus osteomyelitis of the scapula. Aspergillus osteomyelitis is a rare manifestation of invasive aspergillosis and mostly manifests as spondylodiscitis. In this report, we describe a case of Aspergillus osteomyelitis of the scapula treated with combined antifungal therapy and surgery.
