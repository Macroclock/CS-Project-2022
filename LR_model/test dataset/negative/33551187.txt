Heart Retransplantation From an Hepatitis B Core Antibody (Anti-HBcore)-Positive Donor: A CaseÂ Report. Heart transplantation is performed in patients with end-stage heart failure. The number of suitable donors for patients on the urgent heart transplantation waiting list is still low, and effort has been made to increase the number of suitable donors, including extended-criteria donors. We present a case report of heart retransplantation because of graft failure from an hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBcore-positive, HBcAb [+]) and HBs antigen-negative (HBsAg [-]) donor to a seronegative recipient. We show that the procedure, with the use of antiviral prophylaxis, is a safe option for the recipient. Based on anatomopathologic and histopathologic examination of the explanted graft, we also suggest that acute cellular rejection in the transplanted heart may exist despite negative findings in right-sided endomyocardial biopsy.
