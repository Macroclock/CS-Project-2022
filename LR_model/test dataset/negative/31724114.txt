Quantification of myocardial interstitial fibrosis and extracellular volume for the detection of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. In search of a non-invasive alternative detection of early-stage cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), in this preliminary study we tested the hypothesis that interstitial fibrosis quantified with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can serve as a biomarker for the detection of CAV. Late-stage CAV was detected with routine X-ray coronary angiography (XRCA), while a coronary intima-media thickness ratio (IMTR) >â€‰1 on optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to detect early-stage CAV. Interstitial fibrosis was quantified in the endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) and indirectly with CMR as the T 'Cardiac allograft vasculopathy', 'Cardiovascular magnetic resonance', 'Extracellular volume', 'Heart transplantation', 'Interstitial fibrosis', 'Optical coherence tomography'
