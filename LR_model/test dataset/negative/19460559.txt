Long-term mechanical support with the HeartMate II LVAS. The use of left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) is an accepted therapy for patients with refractory heart failure. The HeartMate II is a small (350 g), implantable, axial-flow pump (nonpulsatile flow), which is designed to support the left ventricle for extended periods of time. Here we have reported our initial single-center clinical experience with this device as a bridge to heart transplantation. Between March 2002 and December 2008, 18 transplantable adult patients were supported on long-term HeartMate II LVAS at our institution. The cohort included 15 men with an overall mean age of 52 +/- 8.4 years (range, 31-64 years). Primary indications for implantation were ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMP; n = 13) and idiopathic CMP (n = 5). All heart failure patients were New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV. None of them had undergone prior open heart surgery. Implantation was performed via cannulation of the left ventricular apex and ascending aorta, and in each case was an elective procedure. Mean support time was 217 +/- 212.3 days (range, 1-665 days). Early (30-day) mortality was 27.7% (n = 5) due to multiple organ failure and sepsis as main causes of death. Bleeding requiring reoperation occurred in 6 cases (33.3%). Cerebral hemorrhage occurred in 1 case. There were 2 driveline infections and no device failure. Twelve subjects (66.6%) were successfully discharged home. Overall, 9 patients (50%) underwent transplantation and 3 are awaiting a suitable organ (2 were discharged home and 1 is in hospital). At latest follow-up, the survival rate after heart transplantation was 66.6% (n = 6). Long-term HeartMate II LVAS can successfully bridge patients to heart transplantation. Good mid- and long-term results may support the use of this device even for a permanent solution in nontransplantable subjects.
