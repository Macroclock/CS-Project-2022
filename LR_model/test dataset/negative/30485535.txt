Safety and tolerability of high-intensity statin therapy in heart transplant patients receiving immunosuppression with tacrolimus. Following heart transplantation (HT), HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to reduce total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), and mortality. Studies in HT patients have demonstrated the safety of low/moderate intensity statins; however, little data exist using high-intensity (HI) statins. The study aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HI statins in HT recipients receiving tacrolimus. This single-center, retrospective analysis included adult HT recipients from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2015, who received HI statin therapy during posttransplant follow-up. The primary outcome, tolerability, was defined as the absence of myalgias, hepatotoxicity, rhabdomyolysis, or HI statin dose reduction/discontinuation. The secondary end point was the mean reduction in total and LDL cholesterol. Among the 24 patients included, one experienced myalgias and therapy discontinuation (4%; P > 0.99). No other HI statin dose reduction/discontinuation occurred, and no instances of rhabdomyolysis or hepatotoxicity were observed. The average reduction in total and LDL cholesterol after conversion to HI statin was 35 mg/dL (P = 0.02) and 19 mg/dL (P = 0.10), respectively. High-intensity statin therapy appears safe and efficacious in HT recipients receiving tacrolimus and is a reasonable option for the treatment of refractory hyperlipidemia.
