Optimizing cardioplegia strategy for donor hearts. Variability in organ preservation strategy has thus far prevented meaningful analysis of clinical donor heart cardioplegia strategies. This paper describes our donor heart procurement protocol, techniques, and recovery team responsibilities. We present 21 patients receiving cardiac transplantation at our institution with an adopted cardioplegia protocol. The procurement team perfusionist ensures consistent attention to myocardial protection with standards that are similar to those applied to native hearts for all congenital heart surgeries.
