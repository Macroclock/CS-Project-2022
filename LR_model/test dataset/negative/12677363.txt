Paclitaxel saves rat heart allografts from rejection by inhibition of the primed anti-donor humoral and cellular immune response: implications for transplant patients with cancer. Paclitaxel is an anti-neoplastic drug that was recently shown also to have immunosuppressive properties in na√Øve rat heart transplant recipients. Here, we tested whether paclitaxel could also effectively reverse an ongoing immune response in transplant recipients. We therefore used a model in which Lewis rat recipients receiving ACI rat heterotopic heart allografts were: (1) untreated, or treated with either (2) paclitaxel or (3) cyclosporine, starting 5 days after transplantation. Allograft survival was determined in one group, and in a second group cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses were determined and serum anti-donor cytotoxic antibody levels were measured. Results showed that paclitaxel was as effective as cyclosporine in saving recipients from imminent allograft rejection. Immunologically, paclitaxel reduced the allogeneic-CTL response, but most impressively, the cytotoxic antibody response was nearly eliminated in saved recipients. Therefore, paclitaxel's immunosuppressive properties, along with its known effectiveness against a wide variety of tumors, makes it potentially useful for the simultaneous treatment of rejection and neoplasms in cases of transplant-related cancer.
