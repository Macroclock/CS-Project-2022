[Self-assessed health and psychological symptoms after heart transplantation]. The purpose of this study was to assess quality of life (QoL, self-reported health) and psychological adjustment in a sample of heart transplanted patients. The sample comprised 147 (117 men) Norwegian heart transplanted patients (operated 1983 - 1999). Data on QoL and psychological adjustment were collected during annual routine follow-up controls between 1998 and 2000. The Short Form 36 (SF-36), the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised (SCL-90-R), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used. On average, heart transplant recipients reported significantly reduced QoL and increased levels of psychological symptoms compared to a normative population. Recently operated patients reported a generally good QoL compared to the norms, while there was a worsening after 3 years of both the patients' psychological symptoms and QoL, compared to patients who were transplanted less than 3 years ago. The clinical significance was underscored by the BDI; 30 % of the patients were classified as suffering from mild depression (BDI >/= 10) if transplanted more than 3 years ago, compared to 16 % in patients operated less than 3 years ago (p < .05). 62 % of the patients never returned to work and became/remained permanent disability pensioners. This study demonstrates that heart transplanted patients have a reduced QoL and psychological problems after the transplantation and this seems to worsen with time. Detection and early intervention of psychological symptoms may assist heart transplant survivors in their return to everyday life. The cross-sectional nature of the study makes it difficult to infer causality from these results.
