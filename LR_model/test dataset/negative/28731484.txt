CPR, ECLS, BVAD and successful heart transplantation within 2 months: a single-centre case series in two young, high-urgency listed patients. In times of organ shortage, death while on the heart waiting-list still represents a major problem. As a consequence, bridging to transplant as well as the decision when to escalate therapy play a very important role. We report on two young patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and acute decompensation who were successfully bridged to heart transplantation with both left and temporary right ventricular assist devices in just 2 months. As a permanent biventricular assist device (BVAD) would have definitely impaired the patients' outcome after HTX, we decided to implant an LVAD with a temporary RVAD. In our opinion, this represents a suitable strategy to reduce mortality in HU-listed patients with acute deterioration of cardiac pump function and should be further evaluated in future studies.
