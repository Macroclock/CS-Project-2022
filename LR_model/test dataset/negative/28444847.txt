Complement Dependence of Murine Costimulatory Blockade-Resistant Cellular Cardiac Allograft Rejection. Building on studies showing that ischemia-reperfusion-(I/R)-injury is complement dependent, we tested links among complement activation, transplantation-associated I/R injury, and murine cardiac allograft rejection. We transplanted BALB/c hearts subjected to 8-h cold ischemic storage (CIS) into cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA4)Ig-treated wild-type (WT) or c3 'animal models: murine', 'basic (laboratory) research/science', 'complement biology', 'costimulation', 'immunobiology', 'immunosuppression/immune modulation'
