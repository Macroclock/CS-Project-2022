Prologue: ventricular assist devices and total artificial hearts. A historical perspective. In the 1960s, when LVADs and TAHs were introduced into clinical use, researchers estimated that, with this technology, the problem of heart failure could be solved within 20 years. Unfortunately, the evolution of these devices has taken much longer than anticipated. Nevertheless, significant advances have been achieved in both cardiac assistance and replacement, and today's cardiac surgeons have a wide range of devices from which to choose (Table 4). This progress has largely been due to the support of the NHLBI, especially the Devices and Technology Division headed by John Watson, and of the devoted commitment of the investigators. Because of the long-term commitment required for both basic and clinical research, commercial medical technology companies are unable to assume this burden. Advances in mechanical circulatory support and replacement have benefited numerous patients worldwide who would otherwise have died of heart failure, and devices now exist for use as bridges to recovery, bridges to transplant, and destination therapy. The current challenge is to refine what we have and to apply these technologies to broader patient populations with maximal safety and at a reasonable cost.
