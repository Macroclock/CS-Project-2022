Myocardial iron content and mitochondrial function in human heart failure: a direct tissue analysis. Iron replacement improves clinical status in iron-deficient patients with heart failure (HF), but the pathophysiology is poorly understood. Iron is essential not only for erythropoiesis, but also for cellular bioenergetics. The impact of myocardial iron deficiency (MID) on mitochondrial function, measured directly in the failing human heart, is unknown. Left ventricular samples were obtained from 91 consecutive HF patients undergoing transplantation and 38 HF-free organ donors (controls). Total myocardial iron content, mitochondrial respiration, citric acid cycle and respiratory chain enzyme activities, respiratory chain components (complex I-V), and protein content of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-protective enzymes were measured in tissue homogenates to quantify mitochondrial function. Myocardial iron content was lower in HF compared with controls (156 ± 41 vs. 200 ± 38 µg·g Myocardial iron content is decreased and mitochondrial functions are impaired in advanced HF. MID in HF is associated with diminished citric acid cycle enzyme activities and decreased ROS-protecting enzymes. MID may contribute to altered myocardial substrate use and to worsening of mitochondrial dysfunction that exists in HF.
