Heart-lung transplantation in Iran: a case report. We report our initial experience with a heart-lung transplant operation performed on a 12- year- old girl with Eisenmenger syndrome at Masih Daneshvari Teaching Hospital in Tehran, in 2009. We also outline the operative indications, anesthetic management, and postoperative complications of heart-lung transplantation. We hope that this issue on transplantation may provide an encouraging prospect for patients with end-stage cardiopulmonary disorders in Iran.
