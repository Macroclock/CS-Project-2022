Candida infection in a stent inserted for tracheal stenosis after heart lung transplantation. Although there are many reports on the use of expandable metallic stents for treating an airway stenosis that develops after heart lung transplantation, complications from using these stents are rarely reported. We experienced a case of Candida infection in a stent that was placed to treat a tracheal stenosis after heart lung transplantation in an 11-year-old girl. The patient had progressive shortness of breath developed from the 5th postoperative week. Chest computed tomography and bronchoscopy revealed a stenosis at the level of the anastomosis. After repeated unsuccessful trials of endoscopic ablation of the granuloma, a Palmaz metallic expandable stent (8 x 30 mm) (Johnson and Johnson Interventional Systems Co, Warren, NJ) was placed, which was followed by immediate relief of the dyspnea. Bronchoscopy conducted immediately after the stent placement showed a free floating distal stent end, which needed to be followed up. The patient had been doing well for the next 9 months after stent placement when she again had shortness of breath develop. Endoscopic examination revealed an intraluminally growing fungal mass, which was particularly severe at the distal free edge of the stent. The culture yielded Candida albicans. Aggressive antifungal agents and surgical removal of the stent were planned, but the patient died 1 day after admission.
