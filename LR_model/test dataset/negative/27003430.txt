Mechanical circulatory support for patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy. Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) challenges different disciplines including gynecologists, cardiologists and cardiac surgeons. It is a severe cardiac failure occurring at the end of pregnancy or within the first months after delivery. Urgent intervention is necessary to stabilize hemodynamics with appropriate medication and mechanical assist support. Data of 4 patients with PPCM at a mean age of 28.2 years were analyzed retrospectively. Echocardiography was used to evaluate cardiac function. Despite varying courses of PPCM all women received left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) since their hemodynamics could not be stabilized by medical treatment. Mean gestational week at delivery was 31.5 ± 4.9. Left ventricular ejection fractions of all patients were severely impaired (17.8 ± 3.5 %) before LVAD implantations. After long-term mechanical support (282 and 417 days, respectively) 2 patients were successfully transplanted. Two other females could be weaned from LVAD therapy after 944 and 612 days, respectively. LVAD explanations were performed according to a standardized weaning protocol. Myocardial recovery was confirmed by regular echocardiography, spiroergometry and right heart catheterization. Mechanical assist device support is a surgical strategy either as bridge to transplantation or as bridge to recovery for patients with PPCM.  'Cardiomyopathy', 'Left ventricle', 'Pregnancy'
