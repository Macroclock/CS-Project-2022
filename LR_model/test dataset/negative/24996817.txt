Congenital coronary arteriovenous fistulae in a transplanted heart. We report a very rare case of a heart transplanted man with angiographic documentation of multiple congenital fistulae arising from both coronary arteries and draining into main pulmonary artery. A transthoracic echocardiogram and right heart catheterization were also performed, to assess the functional importance of the shunt. We also carried out a brief review about this rare condition and we reported considerations about its prognosis and treatment.
