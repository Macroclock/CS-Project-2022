Surgery-related complications in cardiac transplantation patients. The surgical techniques was first described by Lower and Shumway for cardiac transplantation have not changed for many years; they are still being commonly used worldwide despite recently presented alternatives. We sought to evaluate the surgical complications among our cardiac transplantation patients in whom we performed the standard technique. The standard biatrial anastomosis technique was used in 13 patients who have a mean follow-up of 18.6 (1 to 38) months. During the follow-up, echocardiographic assessment was performed to evaluate left and right atrial diameters, tricuspid and mitral valve regurgitation, interatrial septum, and suture lines. Elecotrocardiograms were evaluated for arryhthmia and pacemaker requirements in the midterm. The mean left and right atrial diameters were measured as 40.5 (32 to 57) x 66.6 (48 to 78) and 37.9 (32 to 43) x 56.3 (48 to 69) mm, respectively. The jet area was calculated at less than 5 cm(2) for mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation, which can be defined as "mild" regurgitation. There was no increase in the degree of regurgitation of both atrioventricular valves during the follow-up period. In one patient, a thrombus was detected in the suture line; there was a nonsignificant left to right shunt in another patient. A temporary pacemaker was indicated in two patients. Atrial fibrillation was detected in three patients, who responded to medical therapy. During the follow-up atrial fibrillation developed in one patient. The cardiac transplantation operation using the standard technique may result in atrial dysfuntion due to deformation of atrial integrity and geometry. However, when we evaluated our results, we concluded that the standard surgical technique was a safe, simple, effective, and feasible method.
