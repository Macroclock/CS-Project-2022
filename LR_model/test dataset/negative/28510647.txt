Epicardial cardioverter-defibrillator implantation in a 4-month-old infant bridged to heart transplantation. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is the gold standard therapy for the prevention of sudden cardiac death. Nevertheless, ICD placement in the paediatric population is still limited because of several technical difficulties. Several implantation techniques have been proposed but experience in infants with very low weight and less than 6 months is very limited. We herein describe a case of a minimally invasive ICD epicardial implantation in a 4-month-old infant weighing 5 kg. A diagnosis of arrhythmic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular non-compaction disease with ventricular tachycardia storms, QT prolongation and Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern was made. Antiarrhythmic drugs, radiofrequency ablation and sympathetic denervation were not effective. ICD implantation was successful allowing the infant to survive and bridging to heart transplantation.
