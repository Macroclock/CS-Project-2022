Predictive value of achieved blood pressure for cardiac events in the long-term follow-up of heart transplant recipients. A low diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is associated with increased cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease or chronic kidney disease. The aim of this study was to assess the association of blood pressure with cardiac events during the long-term follow-up of heart transplant recipients. In this prospective cohort study, we performed ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and home blood pressure monitoring in 76 transplant heart recipients 13.5±6.6 years after transplantation. The patients were followed for 54±17 months after blood pressure monitoring. Twenty-one patients had a cardiac event (cardiac death, acute coronary event, coronary revascularization procedure, and hospitalization for heart failure) during the follow-up. In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, we found that a DBP below the median value (<81 mmHg) was associated significantly with cardiac events (log-rank: P=0.01). In a multivariate model, plasma creatinine and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), but not DBP, were associated significantly with cardiac events. Low DBP was associated significantly with LVEF less than 55% (P=0.004). A DBP below the median value predicts cardiac events during the long-term follow-up of heart transplant recipients, but is not an independent predictor. The association between low DBP and low LVEF explains at least in part the predictive value of low DBP.
