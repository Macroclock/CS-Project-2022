General pediatric care for a patient after heart transplant: what the practitioner needs to know. The scope of this review is to discuss aspects of general pediatric care which significantly impact the outcome of children after heart transplant. The general practitioner (GP) often serves as the frontline for prevention and early detection of common problems after heart transplant. Multiple studies in the literature show the negative impact of preventable illness in immune compromised patients, including the appropriateness of vaccine administration. Except for live vaccines, pediatric heart transplant recipients generally follow standard childhood vaccine schedules. In addition, diagnosis of cardiac and noncardiac conditions by the practitioner can lead to earlier treatment by subspecialists. While rejection and infection are such conditions the practitioner may identify, psychological and neurocognitive conditions are common and impact both adherence to medications and quality of life. These issues are addressed in this review of the recent literature. Through knowledge, detection, and collaboration of care, the practitioner can greatly improve the well being of pediatric heart transplant recipients.
