Outcomes after heart transplantation and total artificial heart implantation: A multicenter study. We sought to assess the outcomes after heart transplantation (HT) of patients supported with a temporary total artificial heart (t-TAH) as a bridge to transplantation in high-volume centers. A retrospective analysis of 217 consecutive patients who underwent t-TAH (SynCardia Systems, Tucson, Arizona) implantation between January 2014 and May 2019 in 6 high-volume North American centers was performed. End points included survival and adverse events after t-TAH and HT. The mean age of patients was 49 ± 12 years, and heart failure etiologies were non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (36%), ischemic (25%), restrictive (12%), and cardiac graft failure (9%). A total of 101 (48%) patients had Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support patient profile 1, and 65 (31%) had Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support patient profile 2. At the end of the study period, 138 of 217 (63.5%) patients had undergone HT, and 75 (34.5%) patients died before HT. The mean time between t-TAH implantation and HT averaged 181 ± 179 days (range: 0-849) and the mean follow-up after HT was 35 ± 25 months. The overall survival in the entire cohort was 75%, 64%, and 58% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Post-transplant survival was 88%, 84%, 79%, and 74% at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years, respectively. Among the 32 patients (23%) who died after HT, the main causes of death were chronic allograft vasculopathy (25%), multiorgan failure (21.8%), sepsis (15.6%), and stroke (9%). In this multicenter study, almost two thirds of patients implanted with a t-TAH could be transplanted. The overall and post-transplantation survival after t-TAH was satisfactory in these critically ill patients.
