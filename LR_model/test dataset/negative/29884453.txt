Long-term and clinical profile of heart failure with recovered ejection fraction in a non-tertiary hospital. Heart failure (HF) with recovered ejection fraction (EF) is emerging as a different HF subtype. There is little information about his clinical profile in hospitals that are not a reference. We analysed characteristics and prognosis in patients with recovered HF followed prospectively in the HF Unit of a non-tertiary hospital. A total of 431 patients with HF with reduced EF were followed (median 50 months, 79.3% males, mean age 70.3±12.2years). Of the patients, 26.9% (N 116) recovered EF, mainly in the first year of follow-up (76.7%). Compared with patients that did not recovered EF in the follow-up, they were younger, rate of ischemic origin of cardiomyopathy was less frequent and presented less comorbidity. Mortality was lower in patients with recovered HF (survival median of 85.2±2.1 vs. 74.2±1.9 months [log-rank χ HF with recovered EF is a frequent phenomenon. It has a more favourable clinical course, prognosis and basal characteristics than HF with persistent reduced EF. Further studies are needed to identify natural history and optimal medications for HF-recovered patients.
