Cardiac transplantation in situs inversus: two cases reports. The challenge of heart transplantation in patients with situs inversus is reconstruction of the systemic venous return. Herein we have presented 2 cases of complex congenital heart disease with atriovisceral situs inversus. Both of the patients shared many common cardiac anomalies, such as a single ventricle, a single AV valve with severe regurgitation, and severe pulmonary stenosis. We completed the venous connection in 2 different ways. In the first case, the donor inferior vena cava (IVC) was anastomosed to the recipient left-sided IVC directly, making the heart slightly counterclockwise rotated. In the second case, the IVC venous reconnection was accomplished by a composite conduit made of recipient right atrium.
