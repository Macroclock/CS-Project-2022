A "Cat"-astrophic Case of Bartonella henselae infective endocarditis followed by cardiac transplantation salvage therapy. To our knowledge, no cases of Bartonella henselae endocarditis leading to subsequent heart transplantation salvage therapy have been published. We present a case of a 29-year-old man with cat-inflicted B henselae endocarditis and concurrent worsening heart failure, who then underwent successful heart transplantation 50 days following diagnosis. Treatment and monitoring strategies used in this patient are discussed. Furthermore, we review literature related to heart transplantation salvage therapy for endocarditis due to other intracellular pathogens.
