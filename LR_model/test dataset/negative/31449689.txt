Myocardial protection with complementary dose of modified Del Nido cardioplegia during heart transplantation. Myocardial protection during heart transplantation is achieved by a first dose of heart preservation solution during donor heart harvesting, while there is no consensus about the management of complementary doses during implantation in the recipient. We describe a preliminary case series where modified Del Nido Cardioplegia was used as complementary dose at the time of donor heart implantation.
