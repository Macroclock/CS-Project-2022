Determinants of outcome in isolated ventricular noncompaction in childhood. Isolated ventricular noncompaction is now recognized as an important cause of pediatric cardiomyopathy; however, predictors of outcome have yet to be detailed. Echocardiographic features at presentation, including increased noncompacted to compacted segment ratio and enlarged left ventricular dimension, were found to be associated with poor outcomes (heart transplantation, transplant listing, or death).
