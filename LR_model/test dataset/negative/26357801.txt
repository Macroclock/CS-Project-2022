Successful Management of Thrombosis of the Proximal Aorta after Implantation with a Biventricular Assist Device. Continuous-flow ventricular assist devices (CVADs) are associated with a significant complication profile that includes thrombosis of the ascending aorta and aortic valve, thromboembolism, and stroke. Despite an increasing number of reports of thromboembolic complications related to CVADs, there is little in the literature to guide their management. This report describes successful management strategies used during two cases of thrombosis of the ascending aorta during biventricular CentriMag (Levitronix LLC, Waltham, MA) support, including using pre-existing cannulas to initiate cardiopulmonary bypass.
