Cytomegalovirus mismatch after heart transplantation: Impact of antiviral prophylaxis and intravenous hyperimmune globulin. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections are correlated with complications following heart transplantation (HTx) and impaired outcome. The impact of a serologic mismatch between donor and recipient and the necessity of prophylactic virostatic medication is still a matter of concern. We retrospectively reviewed all patients that underwent HTx between 2010 and 2020 in our department. The recipients (n = 176) could be categorized into four risk groups depending on their serologic CMV matching (D Incidence of postoperative morbidity such as primary graft dysfunction, neurological events, infections, and graft rejection were comparable between all groups (p > .05). However, the incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury with hemodialysis was by trend increased in the D Seropositive recipients carry an important risk for CMV-DNAemia. However, we did not observe differences in perioperative morbidity and mortality regarding CMV matching, which might be related to regularly administer prophylactic virostatics and additional CMV-IVIG for risk constellations. For high-risk constellation, long-term application of CMV-IVIG during the first year after transplant may be beneficial.
