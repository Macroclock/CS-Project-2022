Drug interactions between tacrolimus and clotrimazole troche: a data mining approach followed by a pharmacokinetic study. This study investigated the effects of clotrimazole troche on the risk of transplant rejection and the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus. The data mining approach was used to investigate whether the use of clotrimazole increased the risk of transplant rejection in patients receiving tacrolimus therapy. Patient data were acquired from the US Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from the first quarter of 2004 to the end of 2017. Next, we retrospectively investigated the effect of clotrimazole troche on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics in seven patients who underwent heart transplantation between March and December 2017. The FAERS subset data indicated a significant association between transplant rejection and tacrolimus with clotrimazole [reporting odds ratio 1.92, 95% two-sided confidence interval (95% CI) 1.43-2.58, information component 0.81, 95% CI 0.40-1.23]. The pharmacokinetic study demonstrated a significant correlation between trough concentration (C Immediate dose adjustments of tacrolimus may be beneficial to avoid transplant rejection when clotrimazole troche is added or discontinued.
