Hospital outcomes for pediatric heart transplant recipients undergoing tracheostomy: A multi-institutional analysis. Tracheostomy is associated with increased mortality and resource utilization in children with CHD. However, the prevalence and hospital outcomes of tracheostomy in children with HTx are not known. We describe the prevalence and compare the post-HTx hospital outcomes of pediatric patients with Pre-TT and Post-TT to those without tracheostomy. A multi-institutional retrospective cohort study was performed using the Pediatric Health Information System database. Hospital mortality, mediastinitis, LOS, and costs were compared among patients with Pre-TT, Post-TT, and no tracheostomy. Pre-TT was identified in 29 (1.1%) and Post-TT was identified in 41 (1.6%) of 2603 index HTx hospitalizations. Patients with Pre-TT were younger and more likely to have CHD, a non-cardiac birth defect, or an airway anomaly compared to those without Pre-TT. Pre-TT was not independently associated with increased post-HTx in-hospital mortality. Age at HTx < 1 year, CHD, and Post-TT were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Pre-TT that occurred during the HTx hospitalization and Post-TT were associated with increased resource utilization. Tracheostomy was not associated with mediastinitis.
