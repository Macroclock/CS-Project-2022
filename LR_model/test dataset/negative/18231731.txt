Effect of TGF-beta1 on the expression of IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-4 and IL-10 in heart transplantation rejection in rats. To investigate the effect of TGF-beta1 on the expressions of IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-4 and IL-10 in heart transplantation rejection in rats, a model of rat cervical heterotopic heart transplantation was set up and the model rats were randomly divided into three groups: control group, transplant group and TGF-beta1 group. The mRNA expression levels of IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-4 and IL-10 were determined by RT-PCR at the 5th day after the transplantation. The mRNA expression levels of IL-12, IL-15, IL-18 were increased obviously and those of IL-4, IL-10 were significantly decreased in the transplant group as compared with the control group (P<0.01). In the TGF-beta1 group, the mRNA expression levels of IL-12, IL-15, IL-18 were significantly decreased and those of IL-4, IL-10 were significantly increased as compared with the transplant group (P<0.01). The immunosuppressive effect of TGF-beta1 on heart transplantation rejection was related to its inhibition of the expressions of Th1-type cytokines (IL-12, IL-15, IL-18 etc) and its promotion of the expressions of Th2-type cytokines (IL-4, IL-10).
