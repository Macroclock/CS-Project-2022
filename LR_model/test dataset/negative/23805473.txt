[Cytomegalovirus infection and pneumocystis pneumonia after coronary stenting and cardiac transplantation for acute myocardial infarction]. The paper presents the clinical and anatomic data of combination treatment for acute myocardial infarction, by stenting the infarct-related artery, followed by cardiac transplantation, which have provided the optimal result of surgery and caused no severe rejection reaction. The immediate causes of death have been infectious complications (cytomegalovirus infection and pneumocystis pneumonia) developing in the presence of immunodeficiency state. The following diagnosis formulation is pathogenetically warranted: the underlying disease is "Secondary immunodeficiency due to immunosuppressive therapy" and infectious complications may be assigned to the individual rubric "Secondary disease" (i.e. occurring in immunodeficiency).
