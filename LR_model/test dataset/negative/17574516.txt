Initial experiences with the HeartMate vented electric left ventricular assist system in Japan. We report three consecutive cases of long-term circulatory support using the HeartMate vented electric (VE) left ventricular assist system (LVAS). The HeartMate VE LVAS dramatically improved the functional status and quality of life of these three patients with end-stage heart failure, and all were successfully bridged to transplantation after 659, 995, and 1055 days of support on the device. Only an antiplatelet agent was used for anticoagulation therapy, and no cerebrovascular event occurred. Although the pump stopped in two of these three patients 665 days and 491 days after implantation, both were supported by the backup pneumatic driver thereafter. The drive-line exit site became infected in one patient and thinning of the left ventricular wall due to an unknown cause occurred in one patient.
