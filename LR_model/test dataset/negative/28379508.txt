Heart transplantation using a donor with partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection and atrial septal defect. Over the last decade, the shortage of donors has led to increased waiting time prior to transplantation and its related mortality. Therefore, extended criteria for donor hearts have been proposed. In this report, we describe a successful transplantation despite a diagnosis of partial abnormal pulmonary venous return associated with an atrial septal defect sinus venosus and persisting left-sided superior vena cava. Knowledge in congenital cardiac disease can broaden the definition of 'marginal' donor hearts and allow their use without increasing the risk of transplantation.
