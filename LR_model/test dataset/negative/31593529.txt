Insights from Exercise-induced Cardioprotection-from Clinical Application to Basic Research. Exercise has long been recognized as a beneficial living style for cardiovascular health. It has been applied to be a central component of cardiac rehabilitation for patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), coronary heart disease (CHD), post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), post cardiac surgery or transplantation. Although the effect of exercise is multifactorial, in this review, we focus on the specific contribution of regular exercise on the heart and vascular system. We will summarize the known result of clinical findings and possible mechanisms of chronic exercise on the cardiovascular system.
