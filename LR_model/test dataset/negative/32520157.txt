Melatonin and organ transplantation: what is the relationship? Melatonin has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that can influence tissue growth and apoptosis. This aspect may influence the success of organ transplantation. To evaluate the relationship between melatonin and organ transplantation. A systematic review was performed in PubMed databases using the search terms: "melatonin physiology" or "melatonin therapy" and "transplant pharmacology" or "transplant physiology" or "transplant therapy" or "Transplant therapy". Experiments on the organs of the reproductive system were not included. After analysis, five articles were selected after reading the title and abstract of 50 manuscripts. The works were divided into two aspects: a) analysis of the influence of the organ transplantation procedure on melatonin production; b) action of melatonin on organ transplantation. The cardiac transplantation surgical procedure, immunosuppression, and graft did not influence melatonin secretion in rodents, but there was a significant reduction of melatonin in the renal transplantation procedure in patients with renal insufficiency. Melatonin administration in experimental models decreased rejection and improved transplant success. Studies show that melatonin can reduce organ and species dependence, and the use of melatonin decreases graft rejection.
