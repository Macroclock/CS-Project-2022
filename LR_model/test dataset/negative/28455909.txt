Emergency department utilization in pediatric heart transplant recipients. We used the NEDS database (2010) to evaluate ED utilization in PED HT recipients compared to other patient populations with focus on characteristics of ED visits, risk factors for admission, and charges. We analyzed 433 ED visits by PED HT recipients (median age 8 [range: 0-18] years). The most common primary diagnosis category was infectious (n=163, 37.6%), with pneumonia being the most common infectious etiology. When compared to all PED visits, HT visits were more likely to result in hospital admission (32.6% versus 3.9%, P<.001), had greater hospital LOS (median of 3 days [IQR 2-4] versus 2 days [IQR 1-4], P=.001), and accumulated greater total hospital charges (median $26 317 [IQR $11 438-$46 407] versus $12 332 [IQR $7092-$22 583], P<.001). When compared to visits by other SOT recipients, results varied with similar rates of hospital admission for HT, LUNGT, and KT visits and similar LOS for HT and KT visits but differing total hospital charges. Although PED HT recipients account for a small percentage of overall ED visits, they are more likely to be hospitalized and require greater resource utilization compared to the general PED population, but not when compared to other SOT recipients.
