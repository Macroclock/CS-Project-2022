Effect of oral vitamin E and C therapy on calcineurin inhibitor levels in heart transplant recipients. A recent prospective trial demonstrated that oral vitamins C and E retard the early progression of transplant-associated coronary arteriosclerosis; as a result, a number of centers have added these agents to their maintenance regimens. This study reviewed the impact of vitamin E and C supplementation on calcineurin inhibitor trough concentrations. A retrospective chart review of the first 29 heart transplant patients prescribed anti-oxidant agents was performed. Twenty-two patients taking cyclosporin A (CsA) and 7 patients taking tacrolimus were prescribed vitamin C (500 mg twice a day) and vitamin E (400 IU twice a day). Serum chemistries and drug levels were measured before and after vitamin therapy was initiated. The baseline CsA trough concentration (mean +/- SD) was 137 +/- 39 ng/ml and it declined to 99 +/- 54 ng/ml (p = 0.007) after anti-oxidant therapy was initiated. The average percentage decrease in the CsA trough concentration was 30%. No significant changes were seen in the patients taking tacrolimus. These data demonstrate that supplementation with the anti-oxidant agents vitamin C and vitamin E decreases CsA concentrations but does not appear to effect tacrolimus concentrations. Although more detailed pharmacokinetic analysis is necessary to clarify the exact mechanism of this interaction, physicians who take care of transplant recipients should be aware that more frequent CsA concentration monitoring is warranted after initiating these anti-oxidant agents.
