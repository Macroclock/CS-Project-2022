Switch from minimally invasive biventricular mechanical support to cardiopulmonary bypass during heart transplant. An easily reproducible surgical technique to switch from percutaneous minimally invasive biventricular mechanical support to cardiopulmonary bypass during heart transplantation is illustrated. After cannulation of the distal ascending aorta with a standard arterial cannula, the ProtekDuo® cannula and the ProtekSolo® Transseptal cannula were partially retracted to reach the superior and inferior vena cava, respectively, and connected to the pump circuit for the venous drainage. With this cardiopulmonary bypass configuration, orthotopic heart transplantation was routinely performed and, at the end of the procedure, the 2 cannulas were uneventfully removed.
