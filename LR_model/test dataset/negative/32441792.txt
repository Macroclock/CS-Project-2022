Postoperative vasoactive inotropic score is predictive of outcomes in pediatric heart transplantation. Vasoactive inotrope score (VIS) is scarcely studied in pediatric orthotopic heart transplantation (pOHT). We conducted a retrospective review of pOHT (<21 years) recipients. Max VIS and mean VIS were calculated at 0-24 and 24-48 hours post-pOHT. Patients were divided into groups based on ISHLT guidelines: high (>10) and low (≤10). In our group (n = 104), patients with high max and mean VIS groups at 0-24 and 24-48 hours had longer bypass times (high: >130 minutes; low: <108 minutes; P < .05) and high max and mean VIS groups at 0-24 hours had longer ischemic times (high: >215 minutes; low: <192 minutes; P < .05). Patients with high max and mean VIS at 0-24 and 24-48 hours had longer hospital stay, ventilation, inotrope duration, more cardiac events, and acute kidney injury postoperatively (P < .05). High max VIS at 24-48 hours and high mean VIS at 24-48 hours had higher 3-year mortality (P = .04; P = .02). Multivariate analysis confirmed the association of VIS with short-term outcomes. However, VIS was not identified as an independent predictor of mortality. The ROC curve exhibits 10 as the ideal cutoff with area under the curve >0.8 for primary graft dysfunction (PGD).
