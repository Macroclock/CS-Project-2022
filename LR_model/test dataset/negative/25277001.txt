["I am a little out of breath". When a commonplace symptom hides a rare disease: cardiac amyloidosis]. Based on a case report, this article reviews the different forms of cardiac involvement in amyloidosis. This affection refers to the extracellular tissue deposition of protein fibrils (the amyloid substance), which gradually invades a variety of organs, disrupting their function. The clinical presentation depends on the type of the amyloidogenic protein and on its main distribution. The most severe cardiac impairment and with the worse prognosis is seen in its primary form (or AL), while it is less frequent, with a slower course and a better prognosis in its other forms: secondary (AA), familial (ATTR) or senile (SSA).
