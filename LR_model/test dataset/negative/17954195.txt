Aspergillus fumigatus-related spondylodiscitis in a heart transplant patient successfully treated with voriconazole. Organ transplant patients, such as heart transplant (HT) recipients, are prone to infections, among which are yeast infections. Of these, aspergillosis is usually associated with pneumopathy or facial sinusitis, and Aspergillus fumigatus is rarely responsible for osteomyelitis or spondylodiscitis. Herein we have reported a case of an 18-year-old male HT patient presenting with subacute lumbar spondylodiscitis at 6 months posttransplantation and 3 months after antirejection therapy with antithymocyte globulins. A percutaneous needle biopsy of the intervertebral disc yielded Aspergillus fumigatus. The patient had no evidence of lung aspergillosis, but did have maxillary sinusitis. He was successfully treated with voriconazole.
