Symptom-orientated oral hygiene for children after heart transplantation: Effectiveness of a standardized prophylactic program. Children with CHD, especially heart-transplanted patients, are predisposed to have caries lesions, gingivitis and other oral findings like gingival hyperplasia. The aim of the study was the implementation of a specific oral hygiene program in these patients and its effect on the improvement of oral health, especially gingival overgrowth. For this, we used a newly developed systematic GHI to evaluate and describe this gingival alteration. Thirty-three children, aged 6 to 15Â years with cardiac transplants (9 girls, 24 boys), were examined and introduced into a specific oral hygiene program. Each child showed evidence of gingival hyperplasia. They were randomly divided into three groups with the following oral care measurements: Group ZZ tooth brushing, Group ZZS tooth brushing and mouth rinsing, Group ZZSS tooth brushing, mouth rinsing and the use of an additional single and sulcus toothbrush. A significant decline of all oral health parameters could be proven in all groups. Gingival hyperplasia (GHI) improved as well as plaque accumulation (QHI). The children who used in addition to toothbrushing rinsing solutions and/or additional miniature toothbrushes showed better parameters of the gingival hygiene indexes from the baseline examination until the end of the study. The results show that any infant with cardiac transplant has to be introduced into an individualized oral hygiene program underlining the need of comprehensive dental care in cooperation with pediatric cardiology.
