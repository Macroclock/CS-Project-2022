Long-term survival after heart transplantation for cardiac sarcoidosis. Cardiac sarcoidosis is an increasingly common indication for a heart transplant, but there is a paucity of knowledge with regard to long-term outcomes following transplant. We utilized the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database to retrospectively analyze adult patients undergoing first-time, single-organ heart transplant between January 1999 and March 2020. Of the 41,447 patients that underwent heart transplant during the study period, 289 (0.7%) were transplanted for a primary diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy due to cardiac sarcoidosis (RCM-Sarcoidosis). RCM-Sarcoidosis was associated with 33% reduced risk of mortality over 10 years compared to non-RCM indications in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model (p = .03). Ten-year survival functions were improved among RCM-Sarcoidosis compared to this reference group (73.4% [64.2%-80.6%] vs. 59.5% [58.8%-60.1%], p = .002). Among patients transplanted after 1999 who had at least 10 years of follow-up (n = 19,489), median survival of RCM-Sarcoidosis patients was 11.9 [8.3-14.6] years while that of non-RCM patients was 9.9 [4.0-13.1] years. RCM-Sarcoidosis was not associated with an increased risk of secondary outcomes such as graft failure, rejection, or infection. The incidence of retransplant was comparable between RCM-Sarcoidosis and non-RCM patients (1.38% vs. 1.50%, p = .93). These data suggest that long-term outcomes following transplant for cardiac sarcoidosis are favorable compared to heart transplant for other indications. 'cardiovascular research', 'transplant'
