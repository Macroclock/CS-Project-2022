Genetic Association Between Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome and Cardiomyopathies. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) with risk of poor outcome has been linked to  Whole genome sequencing was performed in 197 probands with HLHS, 43 family members, and 813 controls. Data were filtered for rare, segregating variants in 3 index families comprised of an HLHS proband and relative(s) with cardiomyopathy. Whole genome sequencing data from cases and controls were compared for rare variant burden across 56 cardiomyopathy genes utilizing a weighted burden test approach, accounting for multiple testing using a Bonferroni correction. A pathogenic  Whole genome sequencing in multiplex families, proband-parent trios, and case-control cohorts revealed defects in cardiomyopathy-associated genes in patients with HLHS, which may portend impaired functional reserve of the single-ventricle circulation.
