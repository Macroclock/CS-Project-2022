Pathophysiologic and Prognostic Implications of Right Atrial Hypertension in Adults With Tetralogy of Fallot. Background Right atrial pressure (RAP), a composite metric of right ventricular diastolic function, volume status, and right heart compliance, is a predictor of mortality in patients with heart failure due to acquired heart disease. Because patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) might have abnormal right atrial and ventricular mechanics caused by myocardial injury and remodeling, we hypothesized that RAP would be associated with disease severity and cardiovascular adverse events in this population. Methods and Results We performed a cohort study of adults with TOF who underwent right heart catheterization at the Mayo Clinic Rochester between 1990 and 2017. The objective was to determine the association between RAP and multiple domains of disease severity in TOF (percentage of predicted peak oxygen consumption, atrial or ventricular arrhythmia, and heart failure hospitalization), as well as cardiovascular adverse events, defined as sustained ventricular tachycardia, resuscitated or aborted sudden death, heart transplantation, or death. Among 225 patients (113 male; mean age: 39±14 years), mean RAP was 10.7±5.2 mm Hg and median was 10 mm Hg (interquartile range: 7-13 mm Hg). Increasing RAP was associated with atrial or ventricular arrhythmias (odds ratio: 5.01; 95% CI, 1.22-23.49;  'diastolic dysfunction', 'exercise capacity', 'mortality', 'right atrial pressure', 'tetralogy of Fallot'
