Post cardiac transplantation T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder presenting as a solitary lung nodule. Post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is an infrequent, but serious complication of solid organ and bone marrow transplantations. The vast majority of the cases are of B-cell origin and usually associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The non-B (T and NK cell) PTLDs account for up to 14% of the PTLD cases in Western countries. We report a case of a 66-year-old man who received an orthotopic heart transplant for cardiomyopathy 7 years prior to presentation. He was referred to our institution with a hypermetabolic solitary right lower lobe lung nodule with an SUV of 9.2 on PET scan. The combined histomorphological and immunohistochemical pattern was most consistent with monomorphic PTLD, peripheral T-cell lymphoma with angioimmunoblastic features. Molecular studies showed clonal T-cell gamma receptor gene rearrangement. Primary pulmonary involvement of T-cell PTLD is extremely rare. This is the third reported case of T-cell PTLD after cardiac transplantation, primarily involving the lung. Further, studies will be required to determine the appropriate treatment and prognosis of this rare entity.  'PTLD', 'T-cell lymphoma', 'heart transplantation', 'lung nodule'
