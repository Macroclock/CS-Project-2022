Limitation of myocardial and endothelial injury of the rat heart graft after preservation with Centre de Résonance Magnétique Biologique et Médicale (CRMB) solution. Myocardial injury caused by prolonged storage compromises post-transplantation contractile performance and induces endothelial injury. The aim of this study was to compare a solution developed in our laboratory [Centre de Résonance Magnétique Biologique et Médicale (CRMBM) solution] with a widely used solution (Celsior, Genzyme, Saint Germain en Laye, France). Metabolic and contractile parameters as well as indexes of endothelial injury were measured in a heterotopic rat heart transplantation model with a 3-h ischaemia and a 1-h reperfusion. The two solutions were randomly used for cardioplegia and graft preservation in six experiments each. During reperfusion, developed pressure and rate pressure product were higher with CRMBM compared with Celsior (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.0135, respectively). Phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations after reperfusion were significantly higher with CRMBM (P = 0.0069 and P = 0.0053, respectively). Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) protein expression were decreased to the same extent after reperfusion compared with baseline with CRMBM (P = 0.0001 and P < 0.0001, respectively) and Celsior (P = 0.0007 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Total nitrate concentration (NOx) was significantly increased after reperfusion with CRMBM (P < 0.0001 versus baseline and P < 0.0001 versus Celsior). Na,K-ATPase activity was decreased in both groups versus baseline after reperfusion (P < 0.0001 for CRMBM and P < 0.0001 for Celsior). We showed limitation of both myocardial and endothelial damage with CRMBM compared with Celsior during heterotopic rat heart transplantation in vivo.
