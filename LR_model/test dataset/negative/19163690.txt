Application of multiple correspondence analysis to asses the relation between time after transplantation and sympathetic activity in cardiac transplant recipient. The aim of the present study was to evidence that the heart reinnervation can occur and it is related with the time after transplantation (evolution with time). Data were evaluated using Multiple Correspondence Analyses (MCA), which is the ideal method to study the relation, probably nonlinear, between the Time After Transplantation (TAT) and the probable restoration of normal heart rate responses of sinus node regulated by the autonomic nervous system. Twenty four nonrejecting transplant recipients (60 +/- 48 months after transplantation) and nine healthy subjects were studied by heart rate variability parameters. Results showed that sympathetic activity is restored some time after transplantation. Until 48 months, the recent HTR are in direct correlation to low values SD and LF and for the oldest transplant recipient, these parameters are similar to that observed in normal subjects.
