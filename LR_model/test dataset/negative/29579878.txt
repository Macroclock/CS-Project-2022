Prognostic Value of Blood Panel Parameters in Patients With Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Advanced Heart Failure. Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and left ventricular dysfunction have a varied clinical course, not only dependent on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and symptoms. Finding prognostic markers for stratification in these 2 conditions is a critical area of research. Our aim was determine the prognostic value of blood panel basic parameters. We analyzed all patients with idiopathic or familial DCM and LVEF <30% coming to our heart failure unit for evaluation for non-urgent heart transplant during the period of 2009 to 2011. With 5 years of follow-up data, we could study the prognostic value of blood panel parameters. Moreover, we determined the combination of platelet count and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio score from the BIOSTAT-CHF study. Eighty-seven patients were included in the study. After 5 years follow-up, 49 patients (57%) remain alive (group A) and 38 (43%) either died or needed a heart transplant. There were no differences between groups with regard to age or sex. Patients with good progress showed a lower red cell distribution width (RDW), a higher lymphocyte count, and a lower neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio in the initial blood panel. An RDW ≥15% was associated with long-term mortality or heart transplant. A basic blood panel could be a useful tool in assessing patients with heart failure. Larger studies are necessary to confirm our findings. A multimarker strategy could also be useful for stratification of patients with advanced heart failure.
