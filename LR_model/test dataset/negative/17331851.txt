Prevalence of CCR5Delta32 polymorphism in long-term survivors of heart transplantation. CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) contributes to the alloimmune response following solid organ transplantation. In individuals homozygous for the CCR5Delta32 mutation, the receptor is inactive and lymphocyte recruitment and leukocyte trafficking during rejection are inhibited. A significant improvement in graft survival following renal transplantation has been observed in homozygous CCR5Delta32 patients, although conflicting data exist. To determine whether CCR5Delta32 homozygous heart transplant recipients may also benefit compared to those with a normally functioning CCR receptor, the proportion of patients with CCR5Delta32 mutation was examined in a large cohort of patients surviving for a long period after heart transplantation. The prevalence of CCR5 genotype was identified in patients who had survived >or=7 years after heart transplantation. Genotyping was performed centrally by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 555 patients were recruited at three heart transplant centers in Germany. Of these, 442 patients (79.6%) were homozygous for the wild-type allele, 106 (19.1%) were heterozygous for CCR5Delta32 and 7 (1.3%) were homozygous for CCR5Delta32. No statistically significantly differences were observed between the incidence of CCR5Delta32 homozygosity in the study population and the estimated incidence in the normal population. In the absence of a control arm, it cannot be established if homozygous carriers of the CCR5Delta32 allele experience a long-term survival benefit following heart transplantation that may be masked by underrepresentation of the CCR5Delta32 allele in recipients of a heart transplant. To answer this question, the prevalence of CCR5Delta32 homozygosity needs to be established in patients awaiting heart transplantation.
