[Bilateral central retinal vein occlusion associated with moderate acute rejection of a cardiac graft]. We report a case of bilateral central retinal vein occlusion following moderate acute rejection of a cardiac transplant. A 27-year-old man was admitted for sudden bilateral decreased vision due to bilateral central retinal vein occlusion. Visual acuity was 20/63 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. This patient had undergone a heart transplant 6 months before and had presented with moderate acute rejection for a few days. The moderate acute rejection phenomenon includes inflammatory lymphocyte infiltrates, reflecting persistent immune response activation. Moderate acute rejection of a cardiac transplant graft might cause a bilateral central retinal vein occlusion.
