Generalized and specific anxiety in adolescents following heart transplant. Mental health concerns are associated with worse outcomes after adult heart transplant. Illness-specific anxiety is associated with worsened psychological well-being after other solid organ transplants but has never been characterized after pediatric heart transplant. This single-center cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate illness-specific and generalized anxiety after heart transplantation in adolescents. A novel 12-item PHTF, GAD-7, and the PedsQL were administered. Univariate associations of demographics, clinical features, and medication adherence as measured by immunosuppression standard deviation with the PHTF and GAD-7 scores were evaluated. Internal consistency and validity of the PHTF were examined. In total, 30 patients participated. The most common illness-specific fears were retransplantation, rejection, and more generally post-transplant complications. The PHTF had good internal consistency (Cronbach α = .88). Construct validity was demonstrated between PHTF and GAD-7 (r = .62) and PedsQL (r = -.54 to -.62). 23% endorsed moderate to severe generalized anxiety symptoms. More severe symptoms were associated with older age at survey (P = .03), older age at listing (P = .01) and having post-transplant complications (P = .004). Patients with moderate or severe symptoms were more likely to report late immunosuppression doses (P = .004). Illness-specific and generalized anxiety may be prevalent after pediatric heart transplant. Screening for anxiety in adolescents post-transplant may identify those at risk for adverse outcomes including non-adherence. The PHTF is a brief, valid, and reliable instrument identifying illness-specific anxiety in this population.
