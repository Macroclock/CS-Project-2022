Is age a limiting factor for access to transplantation? As a result of increased life expectancy and quality of life, there is an increasing number of patients older than 65 years of age who require the possibility of heart transplantation (HTx). Traditionally, recipient age older than 65 years has been considered a contraindication for performing a HTx because these patients have more comorbidities, are more affected by the adverse effects of immunosuppressive drugs, and obtain a smaller benefit in the medium and long term. Therefore, given the shortage of donors, priority was given to younger recipients. In recent years, studies have been published demonstrating that HTx in this population segment is possible. These results indicate that despite suffering more infections and having longer hospital stays, these patients have fewer rejections, with an overall survival in the medium and long term similar to that of HTx in younger patients. These results have been achieved partly as a result of appropriate selection of recipients and emergence of new immunosuppressive agents that has allowed their use to be individualized to the characteristics and comorbidities of each patient. Despite the latest advances, longer-term multicenter studies are required to clarify the role of alternate lists and the impact of new ventricular assist devices in this population segment.
