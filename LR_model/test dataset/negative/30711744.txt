The change of immunosuppressive regimen from calcineurin inhibitors to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors and its effect on malignancy following heart transplantation. Malignancy is a significant cause of mortality after organ transplantation. There is an increased rate of malignancy following heart transplantation (HTx) compared to the general population and other organ transplant recipients. Post-HTx patients with a history of malignancy are also at a higher risk of developing new malignancies or exacerbation of their existing malignancies. Mammalian target of Rapamycin inhibitors (mTORIs) are newly introduced immunosuppressive drugs with a unique mechanism of action. By changing the immunosuppressive regimen from classic drugs, especially calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) to mTORIs, the rate of developing de novo malignancies and the relapse of former malignancies is significantly reduced. However, issues like allograft function, total surveillance of patients, and post-transplantation complications should be considered during the conversion of drug regimens utilizing CNIs to drug regimens employing mTORIs. We reviewed different post-heart transplant maintenance immunosuppressive regimens and their effect on post-HTx malignancies with a focus on mTORIs, compared safety against effectiveness, and gathered conclusions based on our review of the literature, which may lead clinicians to make a better evidence-based decision regarding post-HTx maintenance immunosuppressive drug regimens. Overall, CNI to mTORI conversion in post-HTx maintenance immunosuppressive drug regimens was associated with a reduced rate of developing malignancy in post-HTx patients. Furthermore, nephrotoxicity decreased significantly while using mTORIs in combination with lower doses of CNIs and the rejection rate was equivalent to CNI-only regimens. In conclusion, mTORI-based maintenance immunosuppressive drug regimens seem to be safe and beneficial when considering efficacy vs. adverse effects, and all-cause mortality rates are significantly lower in patients switched to mTORIs when compared to CNI recipients.
