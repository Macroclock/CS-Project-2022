Acute pulmonary vasoreactivity test with sildenafil or nitric monoxide before left ventricular assist device implantation. There has been no established medical therapy to ameliorate pulmonary hypertension (PH) owing to left heart disease (LHD-PH). It has recently been shown that the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) can improve LHD-PH and therefore has the potential to become a major bridge tool for heart transplantation (HTx). However, some patients still have persistent PH even after LVAD treatment. It is essential to demonstrate the reversibility of end-organ dysfunction, including PH, prior to implantable LVAD treatment, especially in Japan, because implantable LVAD treatment is indicated only as bridge to transplantation. Here we report a patient with LHD-PH whose PH was demonstrated to be reversible by the acute pulmonary vasoreactivity test (APVT) with nitrogen monoxide (NO) and the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil. Both inhaled NO and sildenafil reduced pulmonary vascular resistance, but pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was increased by NO, which was conversely decreased under increased cardiac output by sildenafil. After the patient was listed as an HTx recipient, pulmonary vascular resistance recovered down to an acceptable range with LVAD treatment. Based on these findings, we suggest that the APVT with sildenafil may be a useful and safe tool to predict improvement of PH after LVAD treatment.
