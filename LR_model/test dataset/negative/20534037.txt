Ochroconis gallopava peritonitis in a cardiac transplant patient on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Ochroconis gallopava has rarely been isolated in immunosuppressed patients. We report the first case to our knowledge of O. gallopava peritonitis in a cardiac transplant patient on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. A 58-year-old man who had undergone cardiac transplant 8 years earlier alerted his dialysis nurses to the presence of black material in his catheter lumen. Fungal hyphae were seen on direct microscopy of the black material and from the dialysate effluent, and O. gallopava was cultured from both after 1 day. He was treated successfully with a single dose of intravenous voriconazole, followed by 2 weeks of oral voriconazole.
