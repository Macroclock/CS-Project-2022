Treatment of airway complications following lung transplantation. To describe our experience in airway complications following lung transplant and to suggest a management algorithm, using different tools from the Interventional Pulmonology armamentarium. Retrospective chart review of all airway complications following lung transplant from January 1999 to July 2007. During that period 223 patients underwent lung transplantation, with a total of 345 anastomoses in the airway. Seventy anastomoses (20.23%) had complications requiring endoscopic treatment. The total number of endoscopic interventions were 631 in 52 patients. Thirty three patients had a combination of bronchial stenosis and bronchomalacia. Eighteen patients had bronchial stenosis only and 1 patient had dehiscence of the anastomosis. Balloon dilation was most commonly transiently effective and ultimately 47 patients required stent placement. The most common complication associated with the use of stent was granulation tissue formation, seen in 57.3% of patients. After stent placement, the forced expiratory volume in 1(st) second (FEV(1)) improved significantly. Airway complications after lung transplant are frequent. Balloon dilation was effective only in a few patients with bronchial stenosis, although the majority ultimately needed a stent. Airway repermeabilization after stent placement improved FEV(1). Based on our experience, we propose a management algorithm for airway complications after lung transplant.
