Discontinuation of calcineurin inhibitors in heart transplant patients with end stage renal insufficiency as an alternative model of immunosuppression. Five heart recipients were followed up with mycophenolate mofetil and low dose cyclosporine due to progressive severe chronic postcyclosporine renal failure. Cyclosporine was gradually withdrawn and finally eliminated from immunosuppressive regimen to slow the rate of renal function loss. Improvement of renal function was observed. In the follow up after cyclosporine elimination no risk increase of acute rejection and no deterioration of left ventricle function was observed. Non-calcineurin inhibitors model in heart recipients can be the treatment of choice (but only in very selective cases) in patients with severe chronic renal insufficiency.
