Left ventricular reconstruction as an alternative to heart transplantation: a case report. A 57-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy was referred to our institution to be assessed for heart transplantation. He had symptoms of severe heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction. We proposed surgical ventricular restoration (the Dor procedure) as an alternative to heart transplantation. The patient underwent successful surgery and an uneventful postoperative course. Pre- and postoperative investigations are presented. One year after surgery, the patient is in good clinical and functional condition. This case illustrates that surgical ventricular restoration can be an alternative to heart transplantation.
