FK778, a novel immunosuppressive agent, reduces early adhesion molecule up-regulation and prolongs cardiac allograft survival. The adhesion molecules, P-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 are important mediators of T-cell adhesion and T-cell co-stimulation. We investigated the effect of the malononitrilamide FK778 on cardiac allograft survival, acute allograft rejection, and adhesion molecule up-regulation in a heterotopic, cardiac transplantation model. Rats received low- or high-dose FK778 or no treatment. Grafts were harvested on the fifth postoperative day for histologic examinations. To assess allograft survival, recipients were treated for a maximum of 10 days and grafts were harvested after cessation of the contractile activity. FK778 low dose showed a mild but significant decrease in mononuclear infiltration but failed to markedly reduce histologic rejection, adhesion molecule up-regulation, or to prolong allograft survival. However, high-dose FK778 treatment significantly reduced early up-regulation of P-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1, abolished infiltration, reduced histologic rejection and resulted in prolonged cardiac allograft survival. Therefore, FK778 is a novel, highly desirable immunosuppressive drug for transplantation medicine.
