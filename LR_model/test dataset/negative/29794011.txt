Spontaneous acalculous gallbladder perforation post-cardiac transplantation. Spontaneous acalculous gallbladder perforation is a rare radiological and clinical phenomenon with life-threatening consequences. In the setting of recent cardiac transplantation, the condition is increasingly uncommon and difficult to diagnose preoperatively. We describe a case of spontaneous acalculous gallbladder perforation in an intensive care unit (ICU) patient, most likely due to a combination of cardiac transplantation and immunosuppression. There are no such documented cases in the literature with an established preoperative diagnosis, to the best of our knowledge. Abdominal CT and targeted ultrasound proved complimentary in establishing the diagnosis, facilitating successful and timely treatment with urgent cholecystectomy.
