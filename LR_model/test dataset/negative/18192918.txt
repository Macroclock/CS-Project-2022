Long-term donor-specific tolerance in rat cardiac allografts by intrabone marrow injection of donor bone marrow cells. Donor-specific central tolerance in cardiac allograft can be induced by hematopoietic chimerism via conventional intravenous bone marrow transplantation (IV-BMT). However, there are problems with IV-BMT, such as the risk of graft failure and of the toxicity from conditioning regimens. A new method for heart transplantation is presented. This method consists of administration of fludarabine phosphate (50 mg/kg) and fractionated low-dose irradiation (3.5 Gyx2 or 4.0 Gyx2), followed by intrabone marrow injection of whole bone marrow cells (IBM-BMT) plus heterotopic heart transplantation. Cardiac allografts with IBM-BMT were accepted and survived long-term (>10 months) showing neither acute rejection nor chronic rejection including cardiac allograft vasculopathy by such conditioning regimens. In contrast, cardiac allografts with conventional IV-BMT were rejected within 1 month after the treatment with irradiation of 3.5 Gyx2 or within 3 months after the treatment with irradiation of 4.0 Gyx2. Macrochimerism (>70%) was favorably established and stably maintained by IBM-BMT but not IV-BMT. Low levels of transient mixed chimerism (<7%) were induced by IV-BMT with fludarabine plus 4.0 Gyx2, but the chimerism was lost within 1 month after the treatment. These findings indicate that IBM-BMT is a feasible strategy for the induction of persistent donor-specific tolerance, enables the use of reduced radiation doses as conditioning regimens, and obviates the need for immunosuppressants.
