Insights from continued use of a Novacor Left Ventricular Assist System for a period of 6 years. We report a patient supported with the Novacor Left Ventricular Assist System for more than 6 years and chronicle his progress as an illustration of the clinical, practical, and emotional challenges of this therapy and the benefits of an intervention that can return a morbidly ill patient to an essentially normal lifestyle. This experience underlines the importance of patient selection, optimal timing of intervention, and the potential impact of psychologic issues on outcome.
