Allogenic donor splenocytes pretreated with antisense peptide against B7 prolong cardiac allograft survival. The interaction of T cell CD28/CTLA-4 receptors with B7 on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) represents an important co-stimulatory pathway in T cell activation or anergy. Our previous study indicated that recipients immunized with allogenic donor immature dendritic cells (DCs) or resting B cells could induce specific immune tolerance and prolong allograft survival. A possible mechanism for this observation is that the expression of B7 molecules is either at a low level or lacking on these cells. The present study investigates whether blockade of B7 molecules on donor splenocytes with a B7 antisense peptide (B7AP), i.e. a peptide analogue of the CD28-binding region, could induce specific immune tolerance and prolong allograft survival in the recipients. Both the lymphocyte proliferation reaction and the mice pinna cardiac allograft experiment were performed to evaluate the role of B7AP in inducing specific immune tolerance in recipients in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that 56.65% and 20.52% of C57BL/6 splenocytes expressed B7.1 and B7.2 molecules, respectively, on their cell surface. There were no significant changes of the B7 expression on such splenocytes after being treated by the B7AP (53.28% and 19.06%, respectively). B7AP inhibited the mixed lymphocyte reaction by up to 38.4% and a dose-response correlation was observed for inhibition. The recipients (BALB/c) immunized with B7AP-pretreated C57BL/6 splenocytes induced a specific immune hypo-response (43%versus control) and notably prolonged survival of the C57BL/6 cardiac allograft by up to 20.3 days. In contrast to the normal saline group (average: 8.6 days) and FTD(10) control peptide group (<4 days), the cardiac allograft survival of the test group was extended for an additional 11.7 days. These results strongly support the notion that immunization with donor splenocytes, which had been pretreated with B7AP, induced specific immune tolerance and prolonged allograft survival in the recipients.
