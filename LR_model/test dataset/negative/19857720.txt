Prevalence of chronic kidney disease is extremely high in heart transplant recipients. Patients with cardiovascular disease often have renal dysfunction from concomitant diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or congestive heart failure. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 mL/min is predictive of premature death due to cardiovascular disease. The objective of the present study was to assess the prevalence of kidney dysfunction in 162 heart transplant recipients using estimated GFR according to the Cockcroft-Gault and the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formulas or creatinine clearance (24-hour urine collection). Normal serum creatinine concentrations were noted in 46% of patients. Mean (SD) GFR was 62.92 (31.04) mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula, 55.38 (26.74) mL/min using the MDRD formula, and 62.62 (35.61) mL/min according to creatinine clearance. Using the Cockcroft-Gault formula, a diagnosis of stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD) (GFR 60-89 mL/min) was made in 92 patients (56.8%), stage 3 (GFR 30-59 mL/min) in 62 patients (38.3%), and stage 4 (GFR 15-29 mL/min) in 14 patients (8.6%). Using the MDRD formula, stage 2 CKD was present in 52 patients (28.5%), stage 3 in 77 (51.1%), and stage 4 in 28 (17.3%). According to creatinine clearance, stage 2 CKD was noted in 10 patients (6.2%), stage 3 in 114 (73.3%), and stage 4 in 21 (13.0%). We conclude that the prevalence of CKD is extremely high in heart transplant recipients. Evaluation of renal function is important to select the appropriate technique to reduce cardiovascular risk. A multidisciplinary approach in heart transplant recipients should include a nephrologist.
