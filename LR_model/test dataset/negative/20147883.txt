Return to work and social participation: does type of organ transplantation matter? Return to work and social participation are objective parameters to evaluate the success of transplantation. Existing reports never compared return to work rates between different organ transplant groups, few European studies were published, and information on patients having a volunteer job or being an active club member is scarce. These outcomes have never been compared with the general population. In a cross-sectional sample of 281 kidney, heart, liver, and lung transplant patients, we assessed self-reported return to work (i.e., having a paid job) and social participation (i.e., having a volunteer job or being an active member of a club). These data were compared with the general population. We also explored possible correlates of return to work (multivariable regression analysis). Kidney transplant patients had the highest employment rate (58.6%), followed by heart (43.6%), liver (37.5%), and lung transplant patients (28.1%). Except for kidney patients, these numbers are lower than the 62% population's employment rate. Return to work was more likely if the transplanted organ was other than lung, with younger age at time of transplantation, being male, being married, having a positive perception of one's capability to work, and having worked until at least 1 year before transplant. Volunteer work was similar to the general population (17.4% vs. 21.5%), although less patients were an active club member (28.5% vs. 61%). Obtaining a paid or voluntary job posttransplantation is possible and should be strongly recommended by transplant professionals as a meaningful way to contribute to the society.
