Considerations for patients awaiting heart transplantation. The aim of this study is to provide a description of patients on the waiting list for heart transplants in Germany; the focus is on comparing the era after implementation of the new transplant law with the former era. This study used data from the Eurotransplant registry. The population consisted of all patients who registered for heart transplantation in Germany between January 1990 and May 2009. Patients were followed up to the earliest of the following events: heart transplantation, death, or end of the observation period. The actual mortality rates were calculated using a competing risk methodology. The proportion of patients on the waiting list aged 65 years or older has increased from 1.9 % in 1990 to 8.3 % in 1997, 7.8 % in 2000 and 12.6 % on December 31, 2008. The 1-year waiting list mortality rate, expressed as the proportion of patients who die within 1 year after being listed for heart transplantation decreased in the period 2001-2009 compared to the period 1991-2000. Patients registered in the period from 1991-2000 had a 25.9 % chance of dying prior to heart transplantation compared to 18.9 % for patients who were registered in the years 2001-2009. In the registration period 1981-1990, a transplant candidate had a 64.3 % chance of undergoing heart transplantation within the first year after being listed, while for patients who were registered in the period 2001-2009 this probability has been reduced to 40.2 %. Despite the fact that patient profiles have worsened and access to transplantation decreased, mortality rates of patients on the heart transplant waiting list have decreased. These data show that treatment of patients with advanced heart disease has improved in Germany.
