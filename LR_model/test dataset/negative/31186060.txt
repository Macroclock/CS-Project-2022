Ethnic disparities in cardiac transplantation: opportunities to improve long-term outcomes in all cardiac transplant recipients. Ethnic disparities in cardiovascular outcomes have been increasingly recognized in the medical literature.

This commentary explores possible explanations for the differing outcomes and suggests potential solutions that may improve outcomes for cardiac transplant recipients regardless of ethnicity.
