[Toxoplasmic cyst and heart transplant: a case report of serological reactivation in an acute graft rejection context]. We describe the case of a serological reactivation in a Toxoplasma-seropositive subject, following a cardiac transplantation transmitting cysts contained in the myocardial tissue. In a context of acute graft rejection, primary chemoprophylaxis enables to avoid onset of opportunistic toxoplasmosis, emerging with immunodepletion performed by high-dose steroids. Then, we draw up a brief review of the bibliographical literature about pathophysiological mechanisms of toxoplasmic reactivation in heart transplants.
