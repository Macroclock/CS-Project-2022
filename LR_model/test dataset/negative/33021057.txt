T cell repertoire analysis suggests a prominent bystander response in human cardiac allograft vasculopathy. T cells are implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), yet their clonality, specificity, and function are incompletely defined. Here we used T cell receptor Î² chain (TCRB) sequencing to study the T cell repertoire in the coronary artery, endomyocardium, and peripheral blood at the time of retransplant in four cases of CAV and compared it to the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) repertoire from the same samples. High-dimensional flow cytometry coupled with single-cell PCR was also used to define the T cell phenotype. Extensive overlap was observed between intragraft and blood TCRBs in all cases, a finding supported by robust quantitative diversity metrics. In contrast, blood and graft IGHV repertoires from the same samples showed minimal overlap. Coronary infiltrates included CD4 'T cell biology', 'basic (laboratory) research/science', 'coronary artery disease', 'heart (allograft) function/dysfunction', 'heart transplantation/cardiology', 'molecular biology', 'rejection: vascular'
