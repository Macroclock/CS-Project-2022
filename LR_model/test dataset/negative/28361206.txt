Three-dimensional replica of corrected transposition of the great arteries for successful heart transplantation. A 59-year-old man who had been previously diagnosed with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries at the age of 35 years became a candidate for heart transplantation. At the age of 57 years, he was referred to our hospital and underwent implantation of a left ventricular assist device (EVAHEART; Sun Medical Technology Research Corp., Suwa City, Japan) because of worsening ventricular function and was listed as a heart transplant candidate. A donor appeared when the patient was 59 years. A three-dimensional replica was made using data from computed tomography angiography. The three-dimensional replica was made of soft rubber (crossMedical, Inc., Kyoto, Japan), which enabled the surgeons to understand the relationship between the great arteries and chambers. After repeated dry laboratories using this replica, the patient underwent successful heart transplantation.
