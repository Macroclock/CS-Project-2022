Combination of hDAF-transgenic pig hearts and immunoadsorption in heterotopic xenotransplantation of immunosuppressed baboons. Hyperacute xenograft rejection (HXR) and acute vascular rejection (AVR) after xenotransplantation are triggered by xenoreactive antibodies (XAb) and an activated complement cascade. In a heterotopic (abdominal) xenotransplantation model we combined immunoadsorption (IA, Ig-Therasorb column) and a quadruple immunosuppressive drug therapy in recipient baboons with donor pig hearts transgenic for human decay accelerating factor (hDAF). According to XAb titers between 6 and 14 cycles of IA were performed preoperatively in 4 recipient baboons (18.6 +/- 2.5 kg). Hearts of hDAF-transgenic donor pigs (6.1 +/- 1.1 kg, Imutran Ltd., a Novartis Pharma AG Company, Basel, Switzerland) were heterotopically transplanted using the abdominal technique in baboons. Immunosuppression consisted of cyclophosphamide (CyP) induction therapy, ERL080 (Novartis Pharma AG), cyclosporin A (CyA, Neoral), and steroids. Blood levels of mycophenolate, CyA, immunoglobulins (Ig), anti-pig-antibodies, complement factors, and cardiac enzymes were determined. Abdominal electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography, and palpation were used for monitoring of the pig hearts. Myocardial tissue specimens were examined using immunohistochemistry, light microscope (LM), and electron microscope (EM). Ten cycles of IA alone removed 78% of XAb and accordingly IgM, IgG, IgA, complement C3, and C4. None of the xenografts was hyperacutely rejected, but xenograft failure occurred after 5.0 +/- 1.3 days (range, 2.4-8.0 days) because of an AVR associated with a rapid XAb increase within 24 hours. White blood cell count (10.3 +/- 2.2 G/L) showed a maximum of 13.1 +/- 2.1 (day 1) and constant levels (1.4 +/- 0.3-2.1 +/- 1.3 G/L) between day 3 and 6. Histology (LM/EM) showed massive hemorrhage, necrosis, and vascular thrombi as signs of AVR. Although HXR was prevented by using IA and hDAF-transgenic donor hearts, AVR was not avoided due to insufficient immunosuppressive regimen used and a missed postoperative IA treatment as a result of an inefficient control of XAb production.
