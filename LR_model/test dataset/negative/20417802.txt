Peginterferon alpha-2b and acute allograft failure in a heart transplant recipient. Reports of heart transplant recipients with hepatitis C viral infection treated with peginterferon alpha-2b and ribavirin are very rare. We report a fatal case of acute allograft failure and hepatitis C viral infection in a 50-year-old orthotopic heart transplant recipient. At autopsy, the patient was found to have patent coronary arteries, diffuse severe fatty degeneration of heart myocytes, and no evidence of cellular or humoral rejection, confirming this as a fatal case of cardiotoxicity from peginterferon alpha-2b.
