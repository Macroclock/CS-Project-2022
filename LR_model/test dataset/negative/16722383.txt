[Effect of asarinin on the acute heart transplantation rejection and the expression of adhesion molecule]. To test the effect of asarinin, the extract of Herba Asari, on the acute heart transplantation rejection and the expression of adhesion molecule. Asarinin was extracted from herba asari. 64 SD rats undergone heart transplantation were divided into four groups: group A (control group), group B (Cyclosporine A treated), group C (Asarinin treated), and group D (1/2 CsA and 1/2 Asarinin). Some rats were used to examine survival time (n = 8) and the others were used to observe the pathological injury and the expression level of interrellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-I (VCAM-1) by using immunohistochemistry. Asarinin could prolong the survival time of allografts, which was similar to CsA group (P > 0.05). Asarinin could relieve the damage of cardiomyocytes of the transplanted. Asarinin could also decrease the level of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in the allografts. Asarinin may play important roles in suppressing the immune rejection, prolong the allografts survival time and protect the donor organ, which was similar to CsA. The expression level of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 is increased in suppressing the course of acute rejection and asarinin can inhibit their expression level. Asarinin can decrease the dosage of CsA.
