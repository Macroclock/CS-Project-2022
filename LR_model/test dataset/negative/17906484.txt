Complex multidrug therapy in a patient with pulmonary hypertension before and after orthotopic heart transplantation. A case report. Pulmonary arterial hypertension represents an absolute contraindication for heart transplantation. We report the case of a 30-year-old man with end-stage heart failure due to restrictive cardiomyopathy and pulmonary arterial hypertension. A complex multidrug therapy improved pulmonary haemodynamics to the point that orthotopic heart transplantation could be carried out. At 18-month follow-up after heart transplantation, the patient's cardiac function made a full recovery. Larger prospective studies are warranted to support these results.
