Impact of Sirolimus as a Primary Immunosuppressant on Myocardial Fibrosis and Diastolic Function Following Heart Transplantation. Background Myocardial fibrosis is an important contributor for development of diastolic dysfunction. We investigated the impact of sirolimus as primary immunosuppression on diastolic dysfunction and fibrosis progression among heart transplantation recipients. Methods and Results In 100 heart transplantation recipients who were either treated with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) (n=51) or converted from CNI to sirolimus (n=49), diastolic function parameters were assessed using serial echocardiograms and right heart catheterizations. Myocardial fibrosis was quantified on serial myocardial biopsies. After 3 years, lateral e' increased within the sirolimus group but decreased in the CNI group (0.02±0.04 versus -0.02±0.04 m/s delta change;  'diastolic dysfunction', 'myocardial fibrosis', 'sirolimus'
