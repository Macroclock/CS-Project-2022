Can HLA-G polymorphisms predict the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy? A 14 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in exon 8 of the HLA-G gene is associated with mRNA stability and HLA-G expression. In cardiac transplantation, the 14 bp deletion polymorphism plays an important role in the expression of HLA-G and is associated with fewer episodes of cellular rejection. We investigated the association between the 14 bp insertion/deletion HLA-G polymorphism and cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) post heart transplantation. There were no statistically significant differences in the presence of the three HLA-G genotypes (-14 bp/-14 bp, +14 bp/-14 bp, +14 bp/+14 bp) between patients without CAV and patients with CAV at 1 year (p=0.61) or 5 years (p=0.76) post-transplant. We found no correlation between HLA-G genotypes and CAV progression from baseline to 5 years post-transplant (p=0.55). HLA-G polymorphism appears to play an important role as a genetic indicator for cellular rejection post-transplant; however, it is not a reliable marker to identify patients at risk of CAV.
