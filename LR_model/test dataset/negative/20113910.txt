Pulsatile left ventricular assist device support as a bridge to decision in patients with end-stage heart failure complicated by pulmonary hypertension. Severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) in heart failure (HF) is a risk factor for adverse outcomes after heart transplantation (HTx). Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) improve pulmonary hemodynamics, but our understanding of the degree of improvement and the effect on outcomes is still evolving. We reviewed invasive pulmonary hemodynamics from 58 consecutive patients receiving LVAD support as a bridge to HTx from 1996 to 2003. The primary outcome was change in baseline transpulmonary gradient (TPG) during LVAD support and after HTx/recovery. The secondary outcome was post-HTx survival. All patients (age, 49 +/- 14 years, 79% male, 40% ischemic) received a pulsatile LVAD (median support, 97 days; interquartile range [IQR], 31-222). Hemodynamic measurements were obtained at baseline (median, 1 day; IQR, 1-3), during early (median, 1 day; IQR, 0-4) and late (median, 75 days; IQR, 24-186) LVAD support, and after HTx/recovery (median, 28 days; IQR, 17-40). Improvement in TPG occurred throughout LVAD support and was sustained after HTx/recovery. Levels of TPG reductions in patients with a baseline TPG in the highest quartile (14.1-26.0 mm Hg) were 8.6 +/- 3.5 vs 6.5 +/- 3.1 mm Hg in the lowest quartile (2.0-7.7 mm Hg) during LVAD support (p = 0.102), with 90% vs 100% 30-day post-HTx survival (P = 0.113). Pulmonary hemodynamics and post-HTx survival were similar after pulsatile LVAD support in patients with and without pre-implant PH. LVAD support may be a useful strategy to reverse PH in carefully selected patients, thus improving candidacy for HTx.
