Persistent plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 gene expression in cardiac transplant recipients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 is the primary regulator of urokinase plasminogen activator and tissue plasminogen activator. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 is essential in the control of the thrombotic/fibrinolytic balance and is a marker of endothelial cell injury. Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is reportedly associated with endothelial cell dysfunction. Whether endothelial cell damage plays a role in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy after cardiac transplantation remains unknown. In this study explanted hearts of cardiac transplant recipients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy, as well as control myocardial tissue, were investigated for expression of urokinase plasminogen activator, tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and 2. Furthermore, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 expression was examined in endomyocardial biopsy specimens and sera of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and those with dilated cardiomyopathy during the first posttransplantation year. The effect of the patient's serum on endothelial cells was assessed in vitro to examine the role of circulating endothelial cell damage-related factors. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 expression was upregulated in ischemic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy myocardial tissue versus that seen in control tissue. After transplantation, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 expression returned to control levels in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 expression increased at 24 weeks after transplantation in both biopsy specimens and sera versus that seen in control tissue. Sera of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, but not that of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor A-induced proliferation of endothelial cells, although downstream target gene activation of early growth response factor 1 and NGFI-A binding protein 2 was not affected. These data suggest for the first time that the endothelial cell damage-related process recurs in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy after transplantation, which, independently of vascular endothelial growth factor, is associated with increased plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 expression, and that this pathology might play a role in allograft remodeling in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.
