Sheath hemorrhage after percutaneous ventricular assist device implantation. Technical advances in temporary ventricular assist devices (VADs) continue to progress, allowing for percutaneous implantation during times of hemodynamic instability. However, device delivery systems, i.e., sheaths, lag in their ability to sustain the mechanical demands of these VADs for extended periods. We propose both a novel technique and the implementation of an emergency preparedness plan to be enacted specifically during those times when delivery systems fail thereby leading to potentially catastrophic bleeding complications.
