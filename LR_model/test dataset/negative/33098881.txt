Evaluation of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Therapy as a Bridging Method. With the implementation of the new heart allocation system, heart transplantation teams are prompted to reevaluate management of patients requiring mechanical circulatory support. The purpose of our study is to compare the outcomes of patients supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) before transplantation. The United Network for Organ Sharing database was queried for all adult patients (aged 18 years or more) who required support with ECMO before heart transplantation from 2001 to 2018. Patients were stratified into patients who did not require ECMO before transplantation, who were weaned off ECMO before transplantation, who were bridged immediately to transplantation from ECMO, and who were bridged to a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) before transplantation. Demographics and outcomes including 1-year survival, postoperative stroke, postoperative renal failure requiring dialysis, episodes of rejection, and graft failure were compared. Overall, 29,370 patients did not require ECMO before transplantation, 101 patients were weaned off ECMO before transplantation, 118 were bridged from ECMO directly to transplantation, and 55 patients were successfully bridged from ECMO to LVAD before transplantation. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates found a statistically significant decrease in 1-year survival for patients who were bridged from ECMO to transplantation compared with patients who were bridged to LVAD before subsequent transplantation (P < .001). Our study suggests bridging ECMO patients to an LVAD before transplantation will result in improved 1-year survival compared with patients bridged to immediate transplantation. With the new heart allocation system, continued evaluation of outcomes is required to inform management strategies.
