The effect of veno-arterial extracorporeal oxygenation and nasogastric tube administration on the pharmacokinetic profile of abacavir, lamivudine and dolutegravir: a case report. Pharmacokinetic (PK) changes can affect antiretroviral (ARV) systemic exposure for critically ill patients living with HIV (CI-PLWH). Studies to guide ARV adjustments in this population are limited. A PK analysis was conducted in a 44-year-old CI-PLWH who presented for a heart and lung transplant on veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO). Home ARV therapy (ART) of co-formulated abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir (ABC/3TC/DTG) was continued. ARV serum concentrations were obtained during and after VA ECMO. Two blood levels were drawn at 1 h, for maximum serum concentration (C Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC ART adjustments would not be required for this patient. Additional studies are needed to assess effects of VA ECMO and crushed tube administration of ARVs in CI-PLWH.
