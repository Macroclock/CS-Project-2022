[Thromboembolic complication following temporary discontinuance of anticoagulant therapy in a patient with mechanical heart valve]. Patients with mechanical heart valves are treated with oral anticoagulant therapy in order to minimize the risk of thromboembolism. During invasive procedures it is recommended to temporarily discontinue the oral anticoagulant therapy and substitute with injections of low-molecular-weight heparin. We describe a case where a patient discontinued the oral anticoagulant therapy and had no substitution with low-molecular-weight heparin. The patient had an embolism to the coronary arteries causing progressive heart failure, and the patient was subsequently heart transplanted.
