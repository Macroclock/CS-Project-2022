Implanting the HeartMate 6 (total artificial heart). The HeartMate 3 is a ventricular assist device that supports the heart with a centrifugal continuous flow. It contains a fully levitated rotor to minimize hemolysis and was initially designed as an apical intrapericardial implant. It can be used as a bridge to a transplant, to recovery, or to destination therapy. After we excise the ventricles, we implant 2 HeartMate 3 devices as a total artificial heart (HeartMate 6). The patient was 35 years old when the devices were implanted and had been diagnosed with Yamaguchi syndrome (apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) at 13 years of age. Being listed for a transplant was not an option due to secondary pulmonary hypertension. Furthermore, the conventional method of apically implanting a left ventricular assist device was not possible due to the underlying pathology. A HeartMate 6 implant as a bridge to transplant therapy was planned. Additionally, a CardioMEMS HF System was implanted to monitor the pulmonary artery pressure. The video tutorial provides step-by-step instructions for implanting 2 HeartMate 3 devices as a total artificial heart.
