Aortic insufficiency associated with Impella that required surgical intervention upon implantation of the durable left ventricular assist device. The Impella is an axial-flow percutaneous ventricular assist device for cardiogenic shock. In this report, we describe two patients who developed aortic insufficiency (AI) associated with Impella and required surgical intervention upon implantation of the durable left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Both patients presented with cardiogenic shock and underwent insertion of Impella 5.0 as a bridge to decision. The cardiac function in these patients did not improve and obtaining approval for heart transplantation required time. They were managed with Impella for 91 and 98Â days, respectively. In both cases, moderate AI that was not present before Impella insertion was observed when the Impella was removed. Therefore, we performed aortic valve closure to control the AI during durable LVAD implantation. In patients with durable LVAD implantation, AI may occur and progress after the operation in several cases. Aortic valve surgery is often performed to prevent deterioration of AI, especially in patients with AI before the surgery. Hence, AI is an important complication following Impella device implantation as a bridge to decision. Careful observation of AI is essential when the Impella is removed as the evaluation of AI by echocardiogram during Impella management is cumbersome because of device-generated artifacts.
