Non-In Situ Technique of Heart-Lung Transplantation: Case Series and Technique Description. Heart-lung transplantation (HLTx) is a life-saving treatment option for patients with advanced cardiopulmonary failure. However, posterior mediastinal bleeding and phrenic nerve damage are still intraoperative challenges for the traditional surgical method. This study reports an innovative non-in situ HLTx performed in our center, preventing posterior mediastinal bleeding and phrenic nerve damage effectively. Between September 2015 and September 2020, 12 patients without previous heart surgery underwent a traditional HLTx and were deemed a control group, and 3 patients underwent an innovative non-in situ HLTx. The operative time, cold ischemic time, intraoperative bleeding, intraoperative transfusion, and the intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay were assessed between traditional HLTx and non-in situ HLTx. The innovative non-in situ HLTx was successfully performed in the 3 patients. We found that the intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay, total surgical time, cold ischemic time, intraoperative bleeding, and intraoperative transfusion were decreased in the 3 patients compared with the traditional surgical method. Non-in situ HLTx may decrease posterior mediastinal bleeding and phrenic nerve damage effectively.
