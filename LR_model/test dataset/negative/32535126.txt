Advanced HeartÂ Failure: Epidemiology, Diagnosis, and Therapeutic Approaches. In broad terms, "advanced" heart failure describes a clinical syndrome characterized by persistent or progressive symptoms and ventricular dysfunction despite guideline-directed medical therapy. Clinically the definition is often dependent upon iterative and integrated clinical assessments to identify patients with worsening status and reliance on specific therapies. This review examines current consensus definitions, highlights strategies for risk stratification and prognostication, and examines short- and long-term treatment strategies. Lastly, this paper explores future directions of research and development for the field.
