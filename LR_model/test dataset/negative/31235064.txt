Comparison of Clinical and Morphologic Findings in Patients With Cardiac Sarcoidosis Severe Enough to Warrant Heart Transplantation in Those With -vs- Those Without Non-Caseating Granulomas in the Explanted Heart (Burnt-Out Sarcoid). Can cardiac sarcoidosis with heart failure severe enough to warrant orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) be present without non-caseating granulomas in the explanted heart? The objective is to compare clinical and morphological features in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis severe enough to warrant OHT with -vs-without non-caseating granulomas in the explanted heart. The study was conducted at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. From a total of 671 explanted hearts examined from 1993 to 2018, twenty-five (4%) had gross morphologic features characteristic of cardiac sarcoidosis. At the time of OHT, the patients ranged in age from 50 to 69 years [mean 57]. Cardiac sarcoidosis was diagnosed before OHT in 3 (12%) patients, by percutaneous biopsy of the heart in 2 patients and by histologic examination of the "left ventricular core" in 1 patient who had a left ventricular assist device inserted, and, by examination of the native heart after OHT in the remaining 22 (88%) patients. Of the 25 patients, 16 (64%) had typical sarcoid non-caseating granulomas in the explanted heart, and 9 (36%) had no granulomas in the explanted heart. Comparison of certain clinical and morphologic features in the group with -vs- the group without cardiac granulomas showed no significant differences. In conclusion, of patients with cardiac sarcoidosis severe enough to warrant OHT, some have typical non-caseating granulomas in the explanted heart and some do not. The clinical and gross morphologic features of those with and those without cardiac granulomas are similar.
