Protein Losing Enteropathy After Cardiac Transplantation Successfully Treated by Stent Implantation. Protein losing enteropathy (PLE) is a severe consequence of Fontan physiology that sometimes requires heart transplantation for definitive treatment. We describe transplant refractory PLE in a patient with heterotaxia and complex systemic and hepatic venous connections, successfully treated by transcatheter relief of multiple venous obstructions.
