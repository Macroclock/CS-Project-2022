Reoperative sternotomy is associated with primary graft dysfunction following heart transplantation. Prior sternotomy is associated with increased morbidity and mortality following heart transplantation. However, its effect on primary graft dysfunction (PGD), a major contributor to early mortality, is unknown. Herein, this effect is studied using the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation consensus definition for PGD. Medical records of consecutive adult cardiac transplants between 2012 and 2016 were reviewed. Baseline characteristics, postoperative findings and 1-year survival were compared between patients with and without prior sternotomy. Among 255 total patients included, 139 (55%) had undergone prior sternotomy; these recipients were older, more often male, had higher body mass index, higher frequencies of united network for organ sharing (UNOS) 1A status and ischaemic cardiomyopathy and experienced longer waitlist times when compared with those without prior sternotomy (all P < 0.018). Postoperatively, the prior sternotomy group exhibited higher rates of mild to severe PGD (32% vs 18%; P = 0.015) and higher short-term mortality (P = 0.017) and 1-year mortality (P = 0.047). They required more blood transfusions, had more postoperative pneumonia, wound infection and longer hospital stays. A stepwise multivariable regression model identified prior sternotomy as a predictor of PGD (odds ratio 2.7). Multiple prior sternotomies was associated with even more UNOS 1A status, ischaemic cardiomyopathy and pneumonia. However, logistic modelling did not show a difference in the rate of PGD between those with 1 or ≥2 prior sternotomies. Our data suggest that prior sternotomy is a risk factor for PGD. Consistent with previous reports, prior sternotomy is associated with increased morbidity, blood product utilization and 1-year mortality following cardiac transplantation.
