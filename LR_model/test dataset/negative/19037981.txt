Patency of internal jugular vein following repair after ECMO stabilization prior to Berlin Heart implantation: utility of repaired vein for subsequent cardiac catheterization and biopsy. The objective of this study was to examine the patency and utility for subsequent vascular access of the internal jugular vein following use in short-term extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Retrospective review. Pediatric cardiac intensive care unit, pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratory, and pediatric cardiac clinic. Four children, ages 7-178 months, requiring mechanical circulatory support. Interventions. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, internal jugular vein repair, Berlin Heart mechanical circulatory support, heart transplantation, cardiac catheterization. Following surgical repair, the internal jugular vein was studied with bedside ultrasound for assessment of patency. When appropriate, subsequent vascular access of the vessel was attempted and the success was reported. Follow-up ultrasound examination demonstrated vessel patency in all cases. In patients requiring subsequent catheterization (3/4), successful vessel entry and catheterization were performed. Repair of the internal jugular vein following use for short-term extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support can be accomplished with success. The vessel can be used for subsequent vascular access when necessary.
