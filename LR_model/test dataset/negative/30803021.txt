Sternal wound complications in patients undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation. The incidence and management of sternal wound complications in patients undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) is not well studied. We report outcomes in heart transplant patients who developed sternal infections requiring reoperations. From 2004 to 2013, 437 patients underwent OHT at a single institution. In a retrospective review, patients who developed sternal infections (Infection group, n = 27) were compared with those without (Control group, n = 410). Sternal infection rate was 6.2% (n = 27). Demographics were similar (Table 1). Infection group had higher rates of COPD 25% vs 13%, P = 0.03, and previous cardiac surgery via median sternotomy 28% vs 15%, P = 0.03. Infection group had a greater incidence of prolonged ventilation, 44% vs 31%, P = 0.2, renal failure 56% vs 24%, P = 0.001, dialysis requirement 30% vs 10%, P = 0.006, permanent stroke 11% vs 2%, P = 0.02, perioperative myocardial infarction 4% vs 0.2%, P = 0.09. The infection group had a longer ICU stay (524  + 410 vs 187  + 355 hours, P = 0.001) and hospitalization (59  + 28 vs 0.29  + 43 days, P = 0.001). In-hospital/30-day mortality was 30% vs 19%, P = 0.2. The mean time for sternal reoperation at 44  + 50 days. Deep wound infection (41%) and sternal dehiscence (22%) were common presentations. Causative organisms were Enterobacter (22%), Klebsiella (15%), and Pseudomonas (15%). Vancomycin (44%), 4th generation cephalosporin (37%), and fluoroquinolones (30%) were the most commonly used antibiotics. Surgical treatment included sternal debridement with pectoralis muscle flap (52%), primary closure (18%), and omental flap (11%). Sternal wound infections impart a significant burden on patients with OHT. Causative organisms are predominantly virulent gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, a high index of suspicion must be maintained for early detection and treatment. 'sternal', 'transplant', 'wound infection'
