Cardiac retransplantation in children. To discuss the indications for and outcomes of cardiac retransplantation in childhood. The major challenge of pediatric heart transplantation is graft failure. The major causes of graft failure include coronary allograft vasculopathy and chronic rejection. Retransplantation may be considered in children or young adults who develop graft failure following pediatric heart transplantation. Retransplantation now accounts for 7% of all pediatric transplants. Recent studies have demonstrated that cardiac retransplantation has a poorer outcome than primary heart transplantation. However, the interval from primary transplant to retransplantation appears to impact significantly the success of retransplantation. When children undergo retransplantation for early graft failure, the survival is quite poor and the appropriateness of this strategy is questionable. However, children who undergo retransplantation many years after primary transplantation have outcomes that are similar to primary transplantation. The decision to pursue retransplantation depends on the severity of graft failure and recent data suggest that identification of mild graft dysfunction or coronary allograft vasculopathy does not imply impending graft failure. Novel therapies to extend the life of the primary graft and to stratify those at risk of severe graft dysfunction will improve the allocation of scarce organs for pediatric patients who might be candidates for cardiac retransplantation. Retransplantation can extend the lives of children who develop graft failure after primary transplantation. However, not all patients who develop graft dysfunction should necessarily be listed for retransplantation.
