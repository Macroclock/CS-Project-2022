[Treatment of heart failure in adult congenital heart disease]. The progressive shifting in adult patients with congenital heart disease (ACHD) epidemiology with aging and superimposed acquired cardiac pathology on top of complex congenital heart defects is leading to an increase of hospitalizations for heart failure (HF), which nowadays represents one of the main causes of death in this patient population. Although there is a theoretical evidence to support the use of conventional drugs indicated for the general population with HF, randomized controlled trials do often exclude ACHD patients. Anatomical and physiological heterogeneity makes it difficult to define the role of cardiac resynchronization, and indications are less established. Timing of assessment for heart transplantation is challenging and referral often occurs too late. The present review wants to offer a summary of current therapeutic strategies and discuss future perspectives for ACHD-related HF treatment.
