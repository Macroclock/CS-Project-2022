Massive Biventricular Myocardial Calcification in a Patient with Fulminant Myocarditis Requiring Ventricular Assist Device Support. The natural course of myocardial calcification is unclear. We herein report a case of massive biventricular myocardial calcification associated with fulminant myocarditis and present its natural course. The patient was a 15-year-old boy. Massive calcification was detected in both ventricles on computed tomography several months after left ventricular assist device placement. Although the calcification gradually regressed, the patient's cardiac function did not recover, and he underwent heart transplantation after a waiting period of 3 years. A histological examination revealed severe fibrosis in both ventricles of the original heart. Myocardial calcification might suggest severe myocardial inflammation and injury in cases of fulminant myocarditis. 'heart transplantation', 'myocardial calcification', 'myocarditis'
