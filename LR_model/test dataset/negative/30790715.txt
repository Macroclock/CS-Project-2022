Trends in utilization, mortality, major complications, and cost after total artificial heart implantation in the United States (2009-2015). Total artificial heart (TAH) is a viable bridge to transplant (BTT) strategy for patients with severe biventricular failure or complex congenital heart disease. These patients have higher mortality and morbidity than patients undergoing left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. To assess national trends in in-hospital mortality, major complications, cost, length of stay, and disposition of patients undergoing TAH implantation. Data from the National Inpatient Sample, the largest all-payer inpatient data set in the United States, and the US Census Bureau, for the years 2009 to 2015 were analyzed. Participants included all adult patients who received TAH from 2009 to 2015. Endpoints included in-hospital mortality, in-hospital complications, heart transplantation (HT) in the same admission, length of stay, cost, and disposition at the time of discharge. We identified a total of 143 (weighted = 703) TAH implantations. The number of TAH implants increased during the study period (average annual change +5.8%, p = 0.03). Rates of in-hospital mortality and major complications including ischemic stroke, major bleeding, postoperative infections, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, and HT did not change significantly over the study period. Although the length of stay and disposition patterns did not change over time, we found a significant increase in cost of hospitalization (average annual change +44,362, p = 0.01). The number of HT during the same hospital stay decreased significantly (average annual change -8.1%, p = 0.02). In-hospital mortality and complication rates associated with TAH implantation remain increased and did not change in the era of continuous flow LVADs.
