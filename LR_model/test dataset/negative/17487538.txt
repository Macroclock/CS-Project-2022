Hybrid transcatheter-surgical palliation: basis for univentricular or biventricular repair: the Giessen experience. The outcome of patients with hypoplastic left heart (HLH) is determined by many factors, particularly by the first-step palliative procedure in newborns undergoing the Norwood procedure, its Sano modification, or, rarely, through challenging biventricular repairs. Duct stenting combined with bilateral pulmonary artery banding (PAB) is a new method employed as an alternative first-step approach in a number of centers worldwide. We describe this interventional-surgical "hybrid approach" as an additional strategy for the treatment of newborns with HLH syndrome and HLH complex. Between 1998 and April, 2006, 58 newborns underwent ductal stenting and bilateral PAB. These patients underwent surgical bilateral PAB initially, followed by percutaneous duct stenting; the only exception to this were patients in whom duct stenting was performed as a rescue procedure. Various balloon-expandable and self-expandable stents with different widths and lengths were used during the 8-year period of this study. Balloon dilatation of the atrial septum was performed when indicated. This included 5 patients in whom the atrial septum was stented. Aortic arch reconstruction (AAR) combined with a bidirectional cavopulmonary connection (BCPC) was performed at a median age of 4.8 months (range, 2.6-7.5), and total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) was performed at a median age of 3.1 years (range, 2.5-4). Nine patients were listed for heart transplantation (HTX) and transplanted with AAR when a donor heart was available. Depending on growth of left ventricular structures, biventricular repair (BVR) was performed at a median age of 7.1 months (range, 3.5-10). Overall, 8 of 58 patients (13.8%) treated by the transcatheter-surgical hybrid approach died during the study period. The mortality rate for duct stenting was 1.7% (l/58), and it was 1.7% for bilateral PAB as well. Twenty-seven patients received an AAR/BCPC; 2 of them died (7.4%). Additionally, 1 of 2 patients with AAR/BCPC died while on the waiting list for HTX, resulting in a total mortality rate of 11% with an actuarial survival rate of 89%. One patient is still awaiting AAR + BCPC. Three patients died while on the waiting list for HTX despite successful bilateral PAB and duct stenting. The 30-day mortality rate for TCPC (n = 11), HTX (n = 8), and 18 patients with BVR was 0. The actuarial survival rate for patients with BVR is 93%. Postnatal transcatheter-surgical hybrid palliation expands the surgical options for newborns with HLH. Using hybrid palliation, Norwood stage I operation can be avoided in the neonatal period, the waiting period for children scheduled for cardiac transplantation can be extended, and observation for left ventricular growth suitable for biventricular repair as well.
