Circulating Galectin-3 Following Heart Transplant: Long-term Dynamics and Prognostic Value. Circulating galectin-3 (Gal-3) is elevated and significantly correlates with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with heart failure. However, the relationship between serum Gal-3 and heart transplant (HT) outcomes is unclear. The aim of this study was to describe the longitudinal trend and prognostic value of Gal-3 levels after HT. Banked serum samples were available from 122 HT recipients, collected before transplant and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months posttransplant. Gal-3 levels in these serum samples were measured by enzyme immune assay. Multivariable Cox regression was performed to determine the prognostic value of 12-month posttransplant Gal-3 serum levels. The primary endpoint was the composite variable all-cause death or graft failure over long-term posttransplant follow-up. Circulating Gal-3 concentration steadily decreased during the first year after HT (median values: pretransplant, 19.1 ng/mL; 1-year posttransplant, 14.6 ng/mL; P<.001). Circulating Gal-3 levels 1-year posttransplant were associated with an increased risk of all-cause death or graft failure (adjusted HR per 1 ng/mL, 1.04; 95%CI, 1.01-1.08; P=.008). The predictive accuracy of this biomarker was moderate: area under the ROC curve, 0.72 (95%CI, 0.60-0.82; P<.001). Circulating Gal-3 steadily decreased during the first year after HT. However, 1-year posttransplant Gal-3 serum levels that remained elevated were associated with increased long-term risk of death and graft failure.
