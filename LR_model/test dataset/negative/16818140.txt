Pediatric cardiac transplantation. Pediatric heart transplantation has undergone major changes over the past two decades, marked by a substantial improvement in survival, reduction in posttransplant complications, and enhancement in quality of life for transplant recipients. Actuarial survival has improved substantially in the last decade. Indications for pediatric heart transplant have changed as surgery for complex congenital heart lesions has evolved. There are now left and right ventricular assist devices that are suitable for use in infants as a bridge to transplantation. New immunosuppressive agents have reduced the risk of rejection while minimizing side effects and strategies to reduce the risk of graft coronary disease are beginning to show promise. Finally, true long-term survival for children after heart transplant has now been demonstrated and quality of life is excellent.
