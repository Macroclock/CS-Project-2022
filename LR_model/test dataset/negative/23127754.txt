Effects of chronic sildenafil use on pulmonary hemodynamics and clinical outcomes in heart transplantation. Elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in heart transplant (HT) candidates is associated with poor survival after HT. This study assessed the effect of peri-operative sildenafil administration on pulmonary hemodynamics and clinical outcomes in patients with advanced heart failure who were considered high-risk for HT because of elevated PVR and transpulmonary gradient (TPG). The study included 119 consecutive patients who underwent HT between 2004 and 2011. Fifteen patients (Group A) had severe pulmonary hypertension (PH), defined as mean pulmonary pressure (MPAP)>25 mm Hg and PVR>2.5 Wood units (WU), and/or TPG>12 mm Hg after vasodilator test or the continuous administration of inotropics drugs, and 104 patients (Group B) were without severe PH. Group A received sildenafil therapy. Pulmonary hemodynamics were evaluated before HT with and without sildenafil therapy. Right catheterization was performed early after HT with sildenafil therapy and late after HT without sildenafil. Survival after HT was compared between the groups. The sildenafil dosage was 109±42 mg/day during 163±116 days before HT. After sildenafil therapy MPAP, PVR, and TPG decreased from 43.9±12.5 to 33.4±5.8 mm Hg, 5.0±1.1 to 3.0±1.6 WU, and 17.3±3.2 to 10.2±4.1 mm Hg, respectively (p<.01). All patients underwent successful HT. Sildenafil dosage was 140±70 mg/day for 43±45 days after HT. There were no differences in PVR and TPG with sildenafil therapy early after HT and without sildenafil 6 months after HT. Survival after HT was similar between the groups. Sildenafil therapy before and after HT in patients with severe PH is associated with improved pulmonary hemodynamics and successful HT, without an increase in post-HT mortality.
