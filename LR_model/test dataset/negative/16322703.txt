Heart transplantation in children after mechanical circulatory support: comparison of heart transplantation with ventricular assist devices and elective heart transplantation. Heart transplantation (HTx) is an ultimate treatment for children with end-stage heart failure or inoperable congenital heart disease. The supply of hearts is inadequate; therefore, different mechanical support systems must be used as bridge to HTx in pediatric patients with postoperative low output. The use of ventricular assist devices (VADs) as bridge to HTx in children is limited because of size differences. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the overall long-term outcome of pediatric circulatory support before pediatric HTx. From 1989 through 2004, 91 pediatric patients underwent isolated HTx. Seven of them required mechanical support before transplantation. We reviewed retrospectively the course of 91 children (mean age 14.7 years) who underwent HTx. Group A consisted of elective HTx patients who were treated as outpatients before HTx, whereas group B was the VAD-HTx bridging group (n=7; mean age 12.31 +/- 2.8 years). Mean duration of VAD support was 108 +/- 98 days (minimum 1 day, maximum 258 days). Overall survival rate after HTx was 80% at 1 year without significant differences between groups. Five of seven patients survived and could be discharged after successful HTx, for a survival rate of 77%. The mean follow-up period was 16.76 +/- 10.6 months. No differences in posttransplantation long-term survival and rejection episodes occurred between patients transplanted with or without VAD. VAD therapy can keep pediatric patients with end-stage heart failure alive until successful HTx, and bridge to HTx is a safe procedure in pediatric patients. After HTx, survival rates of these children are similar to those of patients awaiting elective HTx.
