Late outcomes of pediatric heart transplantation are independent of pre-transplant diagnosis and prior cardiac surgical intervention. An increasing number of children are being referred for cardiac transplantation after (1) failing conventional corrective or palliative surgical reconstruction, (2) after stabilization with mechanical circulatory support devices, and (3) when primary graft failure or advanced cardiac allograft vasculopathy are established. The records of 417 infants and children (age range, 0-18 years) who underwent cardiac transplantation from November 1985 through December 2005 at Loma Linda University Children's Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. The pre-transplantation diagnosis was used to divide patients into 3 groups: primary cardiomyopathy (CM), 103; hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), 154; and other complex congenital heart disease (CCHD), 160. These groups were compared and analyzed for differences in early and late morbidity and mortality. Operative mortality was significantly lower in the CM group compared with the HLHS (p < 0.02;) and CCHD groups (p < 0.01). Long-term actuarial recipient survival, however, was similar for all groups. The 15-year actuarial survival was 59% for the CM Group, 57% for the HLHS Group, and 50% for the CCHD Group. Actuarial survival after retransplantation is not statistically different from that with primary cardiac transplantation. Although peri-operative survival was lower in infants and children with HLHS and CCHD compared with those with CM, long-term survival has been the same for all groups. Late survival after retransplantation was not statistically different than among those with primary cardiac transplantation.
