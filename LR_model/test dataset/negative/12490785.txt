The effect of selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 on acute cardiac allograft rejection. Using a rat (Lewis-Wistar Furth) abdominal heterotopic transplantation model, we reported previously that the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is increased in parallel with that of nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-2 during cardiac allograft rejection. To investigate effects of COX-2 inhibition in this model, allograft recipients were treated orally (PO) with 5 mg/kg per day of the tetra substituted furanone selective COX-2 inhibitor 5,5-dimethyl-3-(3 fluorophenyl)-4-(4 methylsulfonal) phenyl-2 (5H)-furanone (DFU) in 1% methyl cellulose solution. In the treated animals, allograft survival was increased from 6.3+/-0.5 to 12.6+/-2.6 days (P = .001). At days 3 and 5 posttransplantation, there were reductions in the extent of the inflammatory infiltrate, endovasculitis, myocardial edema, and cardiomyocyte damage in rejecting allografts. The mean numbers of apoptotic cardiomyocytes determined with the terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) technique were significantly reduced in DFU-treated grafts compared with untreated controls (P < 0.05). At day 3 posttransplantation, prostaglandin E2 synthesis by myocardial slices incubated with 100 microM bradykinin was reduced from 1,097+/-156 to 153+/-63 pg/mg of protein in the treated allografts (P < .005). At day 5, COX-2 protein and mRNA together with COX-2, NOS-2, and nitrotyrosine immunostaining in damaged cardiomyocytes were diminished in treated versus control grafts. The data indicate that the inhibition of COX-2 prolongs allograft survival and reduces myocardial damage and inflammation during acute cardiac allograft rejection.
