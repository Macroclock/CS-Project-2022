Prostate cancer after heart transplantation: unicenter case-control study. We have noted an unexpectedly high incidence of prostate cancer in our heart transplant recipients (HTR). We conducted a retrospective review of patients after heart transplantation to investigate the prevalence, treatment, and outcome of prostate cancer diagnosed after systematic screening (study group). We compared them with case-matched HTR (control). Among 702 recipients, 15 patients had elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Fourteen cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed and treated. The median time between transplantation and prostate cancer diagnosis was 73 months. No patient was diagnosed in a locally advanced (>T2) or metastatic stage. Eleven patients (78.6%) received curative treatment. During follow-up (median, 44 months), 1 patient died from prostate cancer. The survival rate between the study and control groups did not differ. Routine PSA testing is recommended as a screening test for prostate cancer in patients after heart transplantation. We believe this could also result in detection of early stages of prostate cancer, thus allowing curative treatment, and achieving similar survival to other case-matched HTR with no prostate cancer.
