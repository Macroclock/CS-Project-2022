Left ventricular longitudinal strain by speckle-tracking echocardiography is associated with treatment-requiring cardiac allograft rejection. Noninvasive detection of rejection is a major objective in the management of heart transplant recipients. To investigate the utility of 2-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D-STE), we retrospectively evaluated 160 sets of endomyocardial biopsies and echocardiograms from 59 asymptomatic heart transplant recipients. Conventional International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade 1B or higher rejection was considered as treatment-requiring rejection (group R), whereas International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade 0 or 1A was classified as group Non-R. Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS), global circumferential strain, and global radial strain were assessed by 2D-STE. Twenty-five specimens were classified into group R. GLS was significantly associated with treatment-requiring rejection, whereas neither global radial strain nor global circumferential strain were. Lower GLS remained significantly associated with an increased risk of treatment-requiring rejection (odds ratio, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.01-1.30]; P=0.03) even in multivariate analysis. GLS with the absolute value of less than 14.8% showed sensitivity and specificity of 64% and 63%, respectively, for detection of treatment-requiring rejection. The 2D-STE-derived left ventricular GLS was associated with treatment-requiring rejection. Two-dimensional STE might be useful as a noninvasive supplemental tool for monitoring heart transplant recipients for possible treatment-requiring rejection.
