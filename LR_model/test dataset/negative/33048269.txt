Assessment of biatrial function in clinically well pediatric bicaval heart transplantation patients by three-dimensional echocardiography. Atrial size and function are closely correlated with atrial contributions to cardiovascular performance. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess atrial size and function in pediatric heart transplantation (HTx) patients using three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE). We enrolled 33 clinically well pediatric HTx patients and 33 healthy controls with a similar distribution of sex and age to the HTx patients. All patients underwent two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and 3DE. 2DE- and 3DE-derived biatrial maximal volume (Vmax), minimal volume (Vmin), ejection volume (EV), ejection fraction (EF), volume before atrial contraciton (VpreA), passive EV, passive EF, active EV and active EF were obtained in all patients. The 3D left atrail (LA) Vmax, Vmin and VpreA increased significantly in HTx patients after being indexed by BSA, while 3D LAEV and passive EV decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Moreover, the 3D LAEF, LA passive EF, and LA active EF all decreased significantly in HTx patients (P < 0.05). The 3D right atrial (RA) Vmax, Vmin, and VpreA increased significantly in HTx patients (P < 0.05), while the 3D RAEF and RA passive EF decreased significantly in HTx patients (P < 0.05). 3DE-derived LAVmax, LAVpreA, LA passive EV, LAEF, and LA passive EF were all lower than the corresponding 2D parameters. 3DE-derived RAVpreA, RA passive EV and RAEF were all lower than the corresponding 2D parameters. Atrial sizes and function assessed by 3DE- and 2DE-derived parameters, yield significantly discordant results in pediatric HTx patients. 3DE confirms significantly enlarged atrial sizes and decreased atrial functions in pediatric HTx patients.
