Bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltration in a heart transplant recipient. Pulmonary complications are not infrequent after heart transplantation. Kaposi sarcoma is a vascular tumor that can involve the skin as well as visceral organs. We describe a case of visceral and cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma that presented with diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltration and breathlessness 6 month after heart transplantation. Following modulation of the immunosuppressive regimen and addition of chemotherapy, the patient had an excellent response and has had an uneventful 1-year follow-up.
