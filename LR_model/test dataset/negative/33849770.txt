Lung and heart-lung transplantation for children with PAH: Dramatic benefits from the implementation of a high-priority allocation program in France. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is rare but remains fatal in infants and children despite the advance of targeted therapies. Lung transplantation (LTx), first performed in pediatric patients in the 1980s, is, with the Potts shunt, the only potentially life-extending option in patients with end-stage PAH but is possible only in tightly selected patients. Size-matching challenges severely restrict the donor organ pool, resulting-together with peculiarities of PAH in infants-in high waitlist mortality. We aimed to investigate survival when using a high-priority allocation program (HPAP) in children with PAH listed for double-LTx or heart-LTx. We conducted a single-center, retrospective, before-after study of consecutive children with severe Group 1 PAH listed for double-LTx or heart-LTx between 1988 and 2019. The HPAP was implemented in France in 2006 and 2007 for heart-LTx and double-LTx, respectively. Fifty-five children with PAH were listed for transplantation. Mean age at transplantation was 15.8±2.8 years and 72% had heart-lung transplantation. PAH was usually idiopathic (65%) or due to congenital heart disease (25%). HPAP implementation resulted in the following significant benefits: Decreased cumulative incidence of waitlist death within 1 and 2 years (p < 0.0001); increased cumulative incidence of transplantation within 6 months, from 44% to 67% (p < 0.01); and improved survival after listing (at 1, 3, and 5 years: 61%, 50%, and 44% vs. 92%, 84%, and 72% before and after HPAP implementation, respectively; p = 0.02). HPAP implementation was associated with significant improvements in access to transplantation and in survival after listing in children with end-stage PAH.
