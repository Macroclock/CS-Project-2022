The use of selective Th2 blocker dupilumab for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in a heart transplant patient: Case report. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by relapsing eczematous rash with severe pruritus and recurrent infection. Topical emollients and immune-modulators (e.g., corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitor) are first-line therapies for acute flares. In severe refractory cases, systemic immunosuppression may be required. Increased incidence of AD has been documented in heart-transplant children who receive their transplant or thymectomy before the age of 1 year. The treatment of these patients remains a conundrum for dermatologists. We present a case report of a chronically immunosuppressed transplant patient with severe AD treated with dupilumab and in remission for over 2â€‰years with minimal side effects. We will also discuss impact of transplant immunosuppression in the pathogenesis of AD. 'atopic dermatitis', 'immunodeficiency', 'pruritus'
