Improved heart transplant survival for children with congenital heart disease and heterotaxy syndrome in the current era: An analysis from the pediatric heart transplant society. Challenges exist with heterotaxy due to the complexity of heart disease, abnormal venous connections, and infection risks. This study aims to understand heart transplant outcomes for children with heterotaxy. All children with congenital heart disease listed for transplant from 1993 to 2018 were included. Those with and without heterotaxy were compared. Waitlist outcomes and survival post-listing and transplant were analyzed. Post-transplant risk factors were identified using multiphase parametric hazard modeling. There were 4814 children listed, of whom 196 (4%) had heterotaxy. Heterotaxy candidates were older (5.8 ± 5.7 vs 4.2 ± 5.5 years, p < 0.01), listed at a lower urgency status (29.8% vs 18.4%, p < 0.01), more commonly single ventricle physiology (71.3% vs 59.2%, p < 0.01), and less often supported by mechanical ventilation (22% vs 29.1%, p < 0.05) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (3.6% vs 7.5%, p < 0.05). There were no differences in waitlist outcomes of transplant, death, or removal. Overall, post-transplant survival was worse for children with heterotaxy: one-year survival 77.2% vs 85.1%, with and without heterotaxy, respectively. Heterotaxy was an independent predictor for early mortality in the earliest era (1993-2004), HR 2.09, CI 1.16-3.75, p = 0.014. When stratified by era, survival improved with time. Heterotaxy patients had a lower freedom from infection and from severe rejection, but no difference in vasculopathy or malignancy. Mortality risk associated with heterotaxy is mitigated in the recent transplant era. Early referral may improve waitlist outcomes for heterotaxy patients who otherwise have a lower status at listing. Lower freedom from both infection and severe rejection after transplant in heterotaxy highlights the challenges of balancing immune suppression.
