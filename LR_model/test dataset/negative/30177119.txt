Toll-like Receptor 4 Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms and Heart Transplant Rejection. Transplant rejection is one of the major problems after heart transplantation (HTx). The aim of the study was to find possible links between chosen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and heart transplant rejection. Blood samples were taken from 24 patients subjected to HTx between 2010 and 2016 at the Clinic of Cardiac Surgery and Transplantation and under the control of I Clinic of Cardiology. All the patients were permanently controlled and had therapeutic levels of immunosuppressants in their blood. Their DNA was isolated and analyzed using the high-resolution melting method according to the Toll-like receptor 4 SNPs rs10983755 A/G, rs4986791 C/T, rs4986790 A/G, rs10759932 C/T, rs1927911 C/T, rs11536889 C/G, and rs12377632 C/T. The analysis of the clinical data of biopsies according to International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation classification was derived from the patients' medical history, divided into two groups: 0-1b and 2-4. A statistical analysis was then performed. The results obtained showed no association between analyzed SNPs and rejection. For rs10983755 A/G, P = .85; rs4986791 C/T, rs4986790 A/G, and rs1927911 C/T had P = .35; and rs10759932 C/T, rs11536889 C/G, and rs12377632 C/T had P = 1. No association between the SNPs rs10983755 A/G, rs4986791 C/T, rs4986790 A/G, rs10759932 C/T, rs1927911 C/T, rs11536889 C/G, and rs12377632 C/T and heart transplant rejection was found, but further investigation is suggested for TLR4 SNPs with P < .5.
