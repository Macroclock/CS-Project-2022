Early result of heart transplantation in Japan: Osaka University experience. Since the new organ transplantation law was established in 1997, 17 heart transplantations have been performed in Japan, 7 of which were carried out at Osaka University Hospital. Recipient diagnosis was dilated cardiomyopathy in 2, dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 4, and post-myocarditis cardiomyopathy in 1. Ages ranged from 8 to 49 years with a mean of 35.3 years. Five patients were bridged with a left ventricular assist device. The waiting period was 182-977 days (mean, 643 days). There was no early or late death during follow-up of 1-4.8 years. Under a standard triple-drug regimen using mycophenolate, there were 3 rejection episodes greater than grade 3 in 2 patients, and humoral rejection requiring plasmapheresis in one. A young boy whose donor was a hemodynamically compromised adult developed neurological sequelae after resuscitation following ventricular tachycardia. All patients were discharged and went back to work or their regular daily life. Although the donor shortage is still severe in Japan, the resumption of heart transplantation has been satisfactory, and left ventricular assist devices have played a crucial role.
