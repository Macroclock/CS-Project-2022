[Giant cell myocarditis. A case report]. Giant cell myocarditis is a rare disease of unknown origin that is probably autoimmune in nature; the prognosis is poor and death often ensues unless a heart transplant is performed. Several cases responding to immunosuppressive therapy have been recently reported, however. We describe a patient who developed fulminant heart failure requiring heart transplantation. Examination of the explanted heart confirmed the diagnosis of giant cell myocarditis.
