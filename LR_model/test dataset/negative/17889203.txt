Computed tomographic screening of pulmonary arterial hypertension in candidates for lung transplantation. Computed tomography (CT) is essential to evaluate candidates for lung transplantation (LT) We sought to correlate identification of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) via CT to echocardiographic (Eco) and/or hemodynamic observations (Hd) as well as the pathological findings (Path) at posttransplant pneumonectomy. The study included 24 consecutive months follow-up of 71 patients who were referred for LT evaluation with 54 undergoing LT. Study parameters included CT [diameter of the principal pulmonary artery (PPA) >or= 29 mm), PPA/diameter of the ascending aorta (AA) ratio > 1; diameter of the lobar artery (LA)/diameter of the lobar bronchiole (LB) ratio > 1 in three or more lobes; thickening of the anterosuperior pericardial recess (>15 mm); mosaic lung density pattern]; PAPs via Eco and/or Hd, and findings Path of PAH. Statistical analysis included chi-square and Pearson correlation coefficient. Thirty-five patients had PAH. Significant relationships (P < .05) were observed between PAH (Eco and/or Hd) and PPA, PPA/AA, and LA/LB. The sensitivity of the finding PPA >or= 29 mm was 65.9%, and 85.7% when combined with LA/LB > 1. In the Path study, 14/54 patients revealed alterations compatible with PAH. Significant relationships (P < .05) were observed between PAH via Path and PPA (CT) and between PAH via Path and PAH (Eco and/or Hd). CT is useful for the detection of PAH. Findings of PAH via CT were indicative of the need for further confirmatory studies. In contrast, the absence of findings with CT does not exclude the possible presence of PAH.
