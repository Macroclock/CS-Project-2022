Deletion of the activating NK cell receptor NKG2D accelerates rejection of cardiac allografts. It has already been shown that neutralization of the activating NK cell receptor NKG2D in combination with co-stimulation blockade prolongs graft survival of vascularized transplants. In order to clarify the underlying cellular mechanisms, we transplanted complete MHC-disparate BALB/c-derived cardiac grafts into C57BL/6 wildtypes or mice deficient for NKG2D (Klrk1 'animal models: murine', 'basic (laboratory) research/science', 'heart transplantation/cardiology', 'immunobiology', 'innate immunity', 'natural killer (NK) cells/NK receptors', 'rejection'
