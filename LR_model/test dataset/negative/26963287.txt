IL-10 Induces T Cell Exhaustion During Transplantation of Virus Infected Hearts. Unexpected transmissions of viral pathogens during solid organ transplantation (SOT) can result in severe, life-threatening diseases in transplant recipients. Immune activation contributes to disease onset. However mechanisms balancing the immune response against transmitted viral infection through organ transplantation remain unknown. Methods &amp; Here we found, using lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), that transplantation of LCMV infected hearts led to exhaustion of virus specific CD8+ T cells, viral persistence in organs and survival of graft and recipient. Genetic depletion of Interleukin-10 (IL-10) resulted in strong immune activation, graft dysfunction and death of mice, suggesting that IL-10 was a major regulator of CD8+ T cell exhaustion during SOT. In the presence of memory CD8+ T cells, virus could be controlled. However sufficient antiviral immune response resulted in acute rejection of transplanted heart. We found that virus transmitted via SOT could not be controlled by na√Øve mice recipients due to IL-10 mediated CD8+ T cell exhaustion which thereby prevented immunopathology and graft failure whereas memory mice recipients were able to control the virus and induced graft failure.
