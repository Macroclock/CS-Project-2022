Intravascular ultrasound for cardiac allograft vasculopathy detection. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) after heart transplantation is a fibro-proliferative process affecting coronary arteries of the graft in up to 46.8% of the cases during the first 10 years post-transplantation. It is one of the main causes of graft loss and death. Due to graft denervation, CAV causing ischemia is usually clinically silent until the disease is far advanced. In this study, we compared coronary angiography with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) for CAV detection. OUTCOMES: A total of 114 patients with HTx who underwent coronary angiography and IVUS between March 2018 and March 2019 were included. Mean follow-up was 87 ± 61 month. Lesions documented by coronary angiography were found in only 27 (24%) of the 114 patients. IVUS revealed ISHLT CAV  'cardiac allograft vasculopathy', 'chronic rejection', 'heart transplantation', 'intravascular ultrasound', 'vascular graft disease'
