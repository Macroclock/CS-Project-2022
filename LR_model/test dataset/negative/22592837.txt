A syphilis-positive organ donor -- management of the cardiac transplant recipient: a case report and review of the literature. Syphilis as a public health problem has not been resolved. Because donor organs are scarce, Treponema pallidum seropositivity is no longer considered a contraindication to transplant. However, there is little guidance on the management and monitoring on the recipient of organs from patients with syphilis. We present a case of a patient successfully transplanted with a heart from a seropositive donor and a review of the literature.
