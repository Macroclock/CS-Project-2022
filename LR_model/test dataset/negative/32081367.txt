Effect of Ventricular Pacing on Morbidity in Adults After Fontan Repair. Implantation of a permanent pacemaker is a negative prognostic marker in patients with Fontan palliation; however, data delineating outcomes in adult patients with pacemaker requirements are lacking. We hypothesize that high ventricular pacing burden is associated with adverse outcomes in adult Fontan patients. We performed a retrospective review comprising adult patients with history of Fontan repair. A high burden of ventricular pacing was defined as ≥40% pacing. Major adverse clinical events (MACE) were defined as all-cause mortality or need for advanced cardiac therapies (ventricular assist device or heart transplant). A total of 145 adult patients with Fontan were studied for a median of 3.1 years. Twenty (14%) patients had implanted pacemakers with ≥40% ventricular pacing. Twelve events occurred in those with ≥40% ventricular pacing (incidence 60.0%) versus 11 in those without (incidence 8.8%). In multivariable analysis, ≥40% ventricular-pacing (odds ratio 12.51, confidence interval [CI] 3.56 to 43.83, p <0.001) was associated with MACE independent of initial Fontan type, New York Heart Association functional class at baseline, or history of atrial tachyarrythmia. In survival analysis, patients with ≥40% ventricular pacing had nearly 8 times the risk of MACE compared with those with a lower ventricular pacing burden (hazard ratio 7.79, 95% CI 2.56 to 23.66, p <0.001), whereas patients with atrial-only or <40% ventricular pacing burden had a trend toward higher hazard of MACE compared with those without permanent pacemaker (hazard ratio 3.38, 95% CI 0.92 to 12.47, p = 0.07) that did not meet statistical significance. These findings suggest that high ventricular pacing burden contributes to poor outcomes in the adult Fontan patients and bear consideration when determining optimal treatment of tachyarrhythmias in this population.
