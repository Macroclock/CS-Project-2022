Impact of socioeconomic status on outcome of a Brazilian heart transplant recipients cohort. We studied the clinical course of 44 cardiac transplant recipients at our institution according to socioeconomic status (socioeconomic class level, educational level, household family income, dwelling, presence of caregiver, and national health insurance) before the procedure. Patients in the low socioeconomic status had a prognosis similar to that seen in patients in the median socioeconomic status. Thus, low socioeconomic status has no unfavorable impact on outcome of cardiac transplant recipients in Brazil.
