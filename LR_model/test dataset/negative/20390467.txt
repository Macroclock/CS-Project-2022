Post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) twenty years after heart transplantation: a case report and review of the literature. We report a 62-year-old man who developed biopsy-proven post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) 20 years after receiving a heart transplant while being treated with immunosuppressive agents. The patient presented with large retroperitoneal and intestinal wall masses that caused partial gastrointestinal stenosis. Monoclonal antibody against CD20 in conjunction with chemotherapy and tapering of the immunosuppressive regimen was instituted, resulting in objective response of the disease bulk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second reported case of PTLD 20 years after heart transplantation.
