Preliminary evaluation of a new chemiluminescence assay (Liaison Cyclosporine; DiaSorin Laboratories) allowing both C0 and C2 cyclosporine levels determination: comparison with RIA method. Cyclosporine (CsA) monitoring is generally assessed by trough concentration determinations (C0). Recently, the 2-hour postdose CsA level (C2) has been proposed to be a better measurement to predict graft outcome and prevent toxicity. However, using the available methods, C2 determinations require external dilution, which impairs the precision and practicability of the assay. This study assessed the performance characteristics of a new competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA, DiaSorin Laboratories, Anthony, France) for the determination of both C0 and C2 CsA concentrations in whole blood on a Liaison analyzer. The results were compared with the RIA method (DiaSorin) used in our laboratory as a reference technique. Analytical performances showed that the total intra-assay variation coefficients (CVs) on the CLIA Liaison ranged from 7.6% to 11.3%, while the between-day imprecision was 11% (15.2%, 11.5%, and 6.5%). The linearity of the method was estimated over the range of 30 to 2400 ng/mL as a correlation coefficient of r = .997. Recoveries, which were checked by adding pure CsA to CsA-free blood, showed a mean value of 86%. A total of 236 whole-blood samples (31% women, 69% men of mean age 45 +/- 17 years) were subjected to a comparative study of CLIA-CsA versus RIA (radioimmunoassay) values, yielding a correlation coefficient >0.90 (CLIA = 0.825RIA+21.611; r(2) > .90). In conclusion, the CLIA Liaison CsA kit represents an alternative to the radioisotopic method, which allows both C0 and C2 determinations without any preanalytical step. The chemiluminescence method demonstrated good analytical performance and practicability in routine use.
