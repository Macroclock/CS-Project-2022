Improvement of heart allograft acceptability associated with recruitment of CD4+CD25+ T cells in peripheral blood by recipient treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), an important hematopoietic growth factor of the myeloid lineage, exerts profound immunoregulatory effects in T-cell tolerance. The study objective was to investigate the potential mechanism of G-CSF's antirejection effects in a fully mismatched rat cardiac allograft model. The allograft recipients were treated with subcutaneous injection of recombinant human G-CSF (rh-G-CSF) at a dose of 250 microg/kg/d for 6 days starting from the day of cardiac transplantation. The alloreactive T-cell response and rejection level of G-CSF-treated rats were compared with those of control rats using mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) and histological examinations. Cytokine and cellular profiles were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry. The presence and suppressive functions of regulatory T cells were determined by adoptive cell transfer experiments. Posttransplantation treatment of recipients with rh-G-CSF alone prolonged allograft survival, improved allograft biopsy grading scores, and induced alloreactive T-cell hyporesponsiveness accompanied by high levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) production in MLR. It also enhanced CD4+CD25+ T cells in peripheral blood. The splenocytes from rh-G-CSF-treated recipients transferred antirejection effects to secondary recipients. Posttransplantation treatment of cardiac allograft recipients with rh-G-CSF leads to alloreactive T-cell hyporesponsiveness in vivo and in vitro associated with recruitment of CD4+CD25+ T cells in the peripheral blood. This study may provide insight into the application of G-CSF to control acute rejection of solid organ transplantations.
