New Strategies to Expand and Optimize Heart Donor Pool: Ex Vivo Heart Perfusion and Donation After Circulatory Death: A Review of Current Research and Future Trends. Heart transplantation remains the definitive management for end-stage heart failure refractory to medical therapy. While heart transplantation cases are increasing annually worldwide, there remains a deficiency in organ availability with significant patient mortality while on the waiting list. Attempts have therefore been made to expand the donor pool and improve access to available organs by recruiting donors who may not satisfy the standard criteria for organ donation because of donor pathology, anticipated organ ischemic time, or donation after circulatory death. "Ex vivo" heart perfusion (EVHP) is an emerging technique for the procurement of heart allografts. This technique provides mechanically supported warm circulation to a beating heart once removed from the donor and before implantation into the recipient. EVHP can be sustained for several hours, facilitate extended travel time, and enable administration of pharmacological agents to optimize cardiac recovery and function, as well as allow assessment of allograft function before implantation. In this article, we review recent advances in expanding the donor pool for cardiac transplantation. Current limitations of conventional donor criteria are outlined, including the determinants of organ suitability and assessment, involving transplantation of donation after circulatory death hearts, extended criteria donors, and EVHP-associated assessment, optimization, and transportation. Finally, ongoing research relating to organ optimization and functional ex vivo allograft assessment are reviewed.
