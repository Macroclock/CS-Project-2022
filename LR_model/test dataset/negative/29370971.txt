High-dose catecholamine donor support and outcomes after heart transplantation. Higher dose norepinephrine donor support is a frequent reason for donor heart decline, but its associations with outcomes after heart transplantation are unclear. We retrospectively analyzed 965 patients transplanted between 1992 and 2015 in the Heart Transplant Program Vienna. Stratification was performed according to donor norepinephrine dose administered before organ procurement (Group 0: 0 µg/kg/min; Group 1: 0.01 to 0.1 µg/kg/min; Group 2: >0.1 µg/kg/min). Sub-stratification of Group 2 was performed for comparison of high-dose subgroups (Group HD 1: 0.11 to 0.4 µg/kg/min; Group HD 2: >0.4 µg/kg/min). Associations between groups and outcome variables were investigated using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model and logistic regression analyses. Donor norepinephrine dose groups were not associated with overall mortality (Group 1 vs 0: hazard ratio [HR] 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87 to 1.43; Group 2 vs 0: HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.39; p = 0.669). No significant group differences were found for rates of 30-day mortality (p = 0.35), 1-year mortality (p = 0.897), primary graft dysfunction (p = 0.898), prolonged ventilation (p = 0.133) and renal replacement therapy (p = 0.324). Groups 1 and 2 showed higher rates of prolonged intensive care unit stay (18.9% vs 28.5% vs 27.5%, p = 0.005). High-dose subgroups did not differ significantly in 1-year mortality (Group HD 1: 14.3%; Group HD 2: 17.8%; p = 0.549). Acceptance of selected donor hearts supported by higher doses of norepinephrine may be a safe option to increase the donor organ pool.
