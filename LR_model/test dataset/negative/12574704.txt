Quality of life among patients with a left ventricular assist device: what is new? As more patients have a diagnosis of end-stage heart failure, nurses are more likely to encounter the use of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). Currently, LVADs are used as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. However, current research suggests that LVADs may be used as destination therapy for those unable to undergo cardiac transplantation. The technology has been developed to sustain life, but what is the impact of technology on the quality of life? This article reviews current research on the quality of life with an LVAD.
