Is Doppler echocardiography useful for estimating left ventricular filling pressures in pediatric heart transplant recipients? LV E/E' ratio obtained using Doppler echocardiography is considered a surrogate for LV filling pressure in adults but has performed poorly in children. We hypothesized that LV E/E' ratio Z-score, adjusted for age, will relate more strongly to LV filling pressures than LV E/E' ratio in pediatric HT recipients. We analyzed 751 echocardiograms performed within 24 hours of a heart catheterization in 122 pediatric HT recipients (median age at HT 13 years, median 6 studies per patient). The primary end-point was PCWP, assessed both as a continuous and a binary variable. Associations with LV E/E' ratios and z-scores were assessed using generalized estimating equations models. PCWP, LV E/E' ratios (using E' from LV free wall, septum, and their average), and LV E/E' ratio Z-scores, all declined over time after HT. LV E/E' ratios and their Z-scores were significantly associated with PCWP assessed as a continuous variable (P < 0.001 for all); however, the relationship was weak (R 'heart transplantation', 'pediatrics', 'tissue Doppler echocardiography', 'ventricular function'
