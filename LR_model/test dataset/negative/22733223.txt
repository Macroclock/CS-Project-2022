Renal complications following lung and heart-lung transplantation. As survival improves after lung and heart-lung transplants, the long term detrimental impact of current management on renal function becomes more apparent as the number of non-renal solid organ transplant recipients on renal transplant waiting lists increases. Progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the transplant population. In this review we discuss the specific problems prior to lung or heart-lung transplant that predispose to CKD, as well as potential renal complications encountered during the peri- and post-transplant period. Significant acute and chronic nephrotoxicity is caused by calcineurin inhibitors (CNI). Mechanisms to decrease CNI exposure exist but have yet to be adopted in routine clinical care. Modifiable risk factors and the current screening and management approach taken at our institution are described. Pediatric nephrologists should be involved from an early stage. Future work will need to focus on identifying more accurate measures of renal function, given the limitations of current glomerular filtration rate estimation equations in a population where nutritional status may rapidly change post transplant. Multicentre studies of CNI minimisation strategies are required to guide future therapy that aims to minimise CKD development and progression in this vulnerable population.
