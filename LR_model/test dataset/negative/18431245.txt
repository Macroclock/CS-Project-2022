Incidence, predictors, and outcomes of cardiac pacing after cardiac transplantation: an 11-year retrospective analysis. More than 20% of cardiac transplant patients go on to require permanent pacing. We sought to determine the incidence of cardiac pacing in our cardiac transplant population and identify characteristics that may predict which patients will require permanent pacing. We reviewed medical records of cardiac transplant recipients and compared baseline characteristics of patients who received pacemakers with those of patients who did not receive pacemakers. Of 292 patients included in this analysis, 71 (24%) required permanent posttransplant pacing. Use of amiodarone before transplant was associated with a nonsignificant trend toward needing a pacemaker after transplant (P=0.08). Patients undergoing biatrial anastomosis were more likely to require permanent pacing than patients undergoing bicaval anastomosis (P<0.001). Approximately one fourth of cardiac transplant patients require permanent pacing. Surgical technique is a major predictor of who will require permanent pacing after cardiac transplantation.
