Assessment of peripheral endothelial-dependent vasodilatation within the first year after heart transplantation. Peripheral endothelial dysfunction (ED) has been found in patients with severe heart failure. Whether ED improves after heart transplantation (HTx) is still a matter of controversy. Forearm endothelium-dependent vasoreactivity was assessed in 40 patients after HTx. Flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) was measured by high-resolution brachial artery ultrasound to assess endothelial function at 1, 6, and 12 months after HTx. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) was assessed by coronary angiography at 1 and 12 months and by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) at 1 year. Mean FMD at 1 month was 1.9% +/- 2.6%, improving to 3.3% +/- 3.2% at 6 months (p < 0.005) and to 5.1% +/- 3.4% at 1 year (p < 0.0001). FMD was significantly impaired in 33 patients (82%) at 1 month, in 27 (67%) at 6 months, and in 19 (47%) at 1 year after HTx. CAV was diagnosed by IVUS in 19 patients (63%) at 1 year. Patients without peripheral ED at 1 month had lower incidence of increased intimal thickness of 0.5 mm or more at 1 year after HTx (20% vs 75%, p < 0.01). Impairment of peripheral FMD was highly prevalent soon after HTx and was present in nearly 50% of patients at 1 year. Patients without peripheral ED at 1 month were associated with lower probability of CAV. Although more studies are needed, the evaluation of peripheral endothelial function at 1 month after HTx could be potentially useful to identify patients at lower risk of CAV.
