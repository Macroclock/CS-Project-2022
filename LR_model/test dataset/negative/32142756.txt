Serum dilutions as a predictive biomarker for peri-operative desensitization: An exploratory approach to transplanting sensitized heart candidates. Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) of cardiac allografts mediated by anti-HLA Donor Specific Antibodies (DSA) is one of the major barriers to successful transplantation for the treatment of end-stage heart failure. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is a first-line treatment for pre-transplant desensitization. However, indications for treatment regimens and treatment end-points have not been well established. In this study, we investigated how sera dilutions could guide TPE regimens for effective peri-operative desensitization and early AMR treatment. Our data show that 1:16 dilutions of EDTA-treated sera and 1.5 volume TPE reduce anti-HLA class I and class II antibody levels in the same manner and, therefore, allows to predict which antibodies would respond to peri-operative TPE. We successfully applied this approach to transplanting three highly sensitized cardiac recipients (CPRA 85-93%) with peri-operative desensitization based on a virtual crossmatch performed on 1:16 diluted serum. Furthermore, we have used sera dilutions to guide DSA treatment post-transplant. Although these findings have to be confirmed in a larger prospective study, our data suggest that serum dilutions can serve as a predictive biomarker to guide peri-operative desensitization and post-transplant immunologic management.
