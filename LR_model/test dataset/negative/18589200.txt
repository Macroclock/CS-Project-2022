Mitral valve dysfunction and repair following orthotopic heart transplantation: a case report. Mitral valve dysfunction after orthotopic heart transplantation may cause symptoms refractory to medical therapy. In this report, we present a patient who underwent mitral annuloplasty for severe symptomatic mitral valve insufficiency 9 years after heart transplantation, and we critically appraise the literature available for mitral valve dysfunction in this setting. Mitral valve repair, when feasible, should be considered for mitral insufficiency after transplantation to improve functional status and reduce the risk of retransplantation--this is particularly prudent in view of chronic donor shortage.
