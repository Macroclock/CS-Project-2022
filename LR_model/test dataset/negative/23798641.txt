Analysis of aortic valve commissural fusion after support with continuous-flow left ventricular assist device. Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (cf-LVADs) may induce commissural fusion of the aortic valve leaflets. Factors associated with this occurrence of commissural fusion are unknown. The aim of this study was to examine histological characteristics of cf-LVAD-induced commissural fusion in relation to clinical variables. Gross and histopathological examinations were performed on 19 hearts from patients supported by either HeartMate II (n = 17) or HeartWare (n = 2) cf-LVADs and related to clinical characteristics (14 heart transplantation, 5 autopsy). Eleven of the 19 (58%) aortic valves showed fusion of single or multiple commissures (total fusion length 11 mm [4-20] (median [interquartile range]) per valve), some leading to noticeable nodular displacements or considerable lumen diameter narrowing. Multiple fenestrations were observed in one valve. Histopathological examination confirmed commissural fusion, with varying changes in valve layer structure without evidence of inflammatory infiltration at the site of fusion. Commissural fusion was associated with continuous aortic valve closure during cf-LVAD support (P = 0.03). LVAD-induced aortic valve insufficiency developed in all patients with commissural fusion and in 67% of patients without fusion. Age, duration of cf-LVAD support and aetiology of heart failure (ischaemic vs dilated cardiomyopathy) were not associated with the degree of fusion. Aortic valve commissural fusion after support with cf-LVADs is a non-inflammatory process leading to changes in valve layer structure that can be observed in >50% of cf-LVAD patients. This is the first study showing that patients receiving full cf-LVAD support without opening of the valve have a significantly higher risk of developing commissural fusion than patients on partial support.
