Design, synthesis, and evaluation of 4,6-diaminonicotinamide derivatives as novel and potent immunomodulators targeting JAK3. In organ transplantation, T cell-mediated immune responses play a key role in the rejection of allografts. Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells and associated with regulation of T cell development via interleukin-2 signaling pathway. Here, we designed novel 4,6-diaminonicotinamide derivatives as immunomodulators targeting JAK3 for prevention of transplant rejection. Our optimization of C4- and C6-substituents and docking calculations to JAK3 protein confirmed that the 4,6-diaminonicotinamide scaffold resulted in potent inhibition of JAK3. We also investigated avoidance of human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) inhibitory activity. Selected compound 28 in combination with tacrolimus prevented allograft rejection in a rat heterotopic cardiac transplantation model.
