Late gadolinium enhancement in cardiac transplant patients is associated with adverse ventricular functional parameters and clinical outcomes. Heart transplant recipients (HTRs) experience multiple cardiac complications, many of which might produce myocardial fibrosis. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) can image myocardial fibrosis using late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging. We hypothesized that the presence and volume of LGE in heart transplant recipients correlates with left ventricular (LV) functional parameters and clinical outcomes. Thirty-eight stable HTRs underwent a CMR study and clinical follow-up. In 38 stable HTRs, LGE was seen in 19 patients (50%), of which 15 (79%) had a nonischemic pattern and 4 (21%) had an ischemic pattern. LGE volume was associated with reduced LV ejection fraction (EF) (R(2) = 0.57; P = 0.001) and increased LV end-diastolic volume (R(2) = 0.59; P = 0.001). The presence of LGE was associated with cardiovascular death or hospitalization within the next year (P = 0.04), and patients who died or were hospitalized had more LGE than those that were not hospitalized (15 g vs 7 g; P = 0.03). LGE is common in HTR and is associated with adverse ventricular remodelling and adverse clinical outcomes. LGE might be a useful noninvasive approach to monitor graft disease in asymptomatic patients after heart transplant.
