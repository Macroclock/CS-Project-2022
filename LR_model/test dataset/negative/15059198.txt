Crohn's disease post-cardiac transplantation presenting with severe growth failure and delayed onset of puberty. We report a 15 yr-old girl who 10 yr post-cardiac transplantation presented with severe growth failure and delayed onset of puberty. She was found to have pan-enteric Crohn's disease and has done remarkably well on principally nutritional therapy with a significant growth spurt and the onset of menarche. The development of bowel disease whilst on immunosuppression is rare and the literature is reviewed.
