Erosion of Transplantation Tolerance After Infection. Recent clinical studies suggest that operational allograft tolerance can be persistent, but long-term surviving allografts can be rejected in a subset of patients, sometimes after episodes of infection. In this study, we examined the impact of Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) infection on the quality of tolerance in a mouse model of heart allograft transplantation. Lm infection induced full rejection in 40% of tolerant recipients, with the remaining experiencing a rejection crisis or no palpable change in their allografts. In the surviving allografts on day 8 postinfection, graft-infiltrating cell numbers increased and exhibited a loss in the tolerance gene signature. By day 30 postinfection, the tolerance signature was broadly restored, but with a discernible reduction in the expression of a subset of 234 genes that marked tolerance and was down-regulated at day 8 post-Lm infection. We further demonstrated that the tolerant state after Lm infection was functionally eroded, as rejection of the long-term surviving graft was induced with anti-PD-L1 whereas the same treatment had no effect in noninfected tolerant mice. Collectively, these observations demonstrate that tolerance, even if initially robust, exists as a continuum that can be eroded following bystander immune responses that accompany certain infections.
