Machine perfusion of donor heart with normothermic blood versus hypothermic HTK in preserving coronary endothelium in a porcine model of DCD. Both machine perfusion (MP) of donor hearts with autologous blood and crystalloid perfusates have advantages and disadvantages. Currently, which of the aforementioned preservation strategies can better preserve the coronary endothelium has not yet been determined. We aim to compare the impact of hypothermic continuous MP with histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution versus normothermic continuous MP with autologous blood on coronary endothelium in a porcine ex vivo model of donation following circulatory death (DCD). DCD pigs underwent circulatory arrest via asphyxiation followed by 30-minute warm ischemia time. Donor hearts were preserved with either hypothermic MP with HTK solution (MP + HTK group; 4 ℃; n=6), or normothermic MP with blood (MP + blood group; 37 ℃; n=6) for 4 hours. After 2-hour ex vivo reperfusion, the assessment of endothelial-dependent (Edep) and -independent (Eind) relaxation of coronary artery, histopathological analysis, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay were performed. Preservation of DCD hearts with MP + Blood strategy significantly improved both Edep and Eind vasorelaxation of coronary artery compared with MP + HTK strategy (maximum relaxation to bradykinin: MP + HTK 80.9%±2.6% vs. MP + Blood 91.9%±1.9%, P<0.001; maximum relaxation to sodium nitroprusside: MP + HTK 97.1%±1.0% vs. MP + Blood 99.8%±0.2%, P<0.05). MP + Blood strategy significantly decreased nitrotyrosine but increased intercellular adhesion molecule-1 immunoreactivity in the coronary artery. The number of TUNEL-positive cells in MP + Blood group were significantly fewer compared with MP + HTK group. Compared with MP + HTK strategy, MP + Blood strategy significantly alleviates coronary endothelial dysfunction during donor heart preservation. This protective effect is associated with the inhibition of apoptosis and nitro-oxidative stress in coronary artery.
