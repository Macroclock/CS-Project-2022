Biomarker discovery in cardiac allograft vasculopathy using targeted aptamer proteomics. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) limits long-term survival after heart transplantation. Non-invasive evaluation is challenging, and currently, there is no validated biomarker for CAV diagnosis or prognostication. To identify potential candidate CAV biomarkers, we utilized the Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMAscan) assay, which evaluates over 1000 serum proteins, including many relevant to biological pathways in CAV. We evaluated three heart transplant patient groups according to angiographic ISHLT CAV grade: CAV 'aptamer proteomic profiling', 'cardiac allograft vasculopathy', 'serum biomarkers'
