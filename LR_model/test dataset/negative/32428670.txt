Bariatric Surgery in End-Stage Heart Failure: Feasibility in Successful Attainment of a Target Body Mass Index. Orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) is contraindicated in morbidly obese patients with end-stage heart failure (HF), for whom cardiac allograft is the only means for long-term survival. Bariatric surgery may allow them to achieve target body mass index (BMI) for OHT METHODS: From 4/2014 to 12/2018, 26 morbidly obese HF patients who did not meet BMI eligibility criteria for OHT underwent laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Outcomes of interest were median difference in BMI, number of patients achieving target BMI for OHT, and 30-day mortality. Median age was 49 (IQR 14) years, and 13 (50%) were women. HF was mainly systolic (15 patients, 58%). The median LVEF was 27% (IQR 37%). At the time of bariatric surgery, 12 (46%) patients had mechanical circulatory support: 2 (8%) concomitant left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placements, 8 (31%) LVAD already-in-place, and 2 (8%) intra-aortic balloon pumps. There was no 30-day mortality, but one mortality on postoperative day 48. Over a median follow-up of 6 months (range 0-36 months, IQR 17), there was a significant reduction in BMI (p<0.0001). The median postoperative BMI was 36.7 (IQR 8.7), compared to preoperative median BMI of 42.7 (IQR 9.4). Target BMI of < 35 was achieved in 11 (42%) patients. Three patients (12%) have undergone OHT. Bariatric surgery in end-stage HF is feasible and results in a high number of patients achieving target BMI, increasing their probability of undergoing OHT. The presence of a LVAD should not preclude these patients from undergoing a bariatric intervention.
