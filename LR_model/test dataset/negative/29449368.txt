Immunosuppressive Therapy Improves Both Short- and Long-Term Prognosis in Patients With Virus-Negative Nonfulminant Inflammatory Cardiomyopathy. Inflammatory cardiomyopathy (infl-CMP) is characterized by increased cardiac inflammation in the absence of viruses, ischemia, valvular disease, or other apparent causes. Studies addressing the efficacy of immunosuppressive therapy in patients with infl-CMP are sparse. This study retrospectively investigates whether immunosuppressive agents on top of heart failure therapy according to current guidelines improves cardiac function and long-term outcome in patients with infl-CMP. Within the Innsbruck and Maastricht Cardiomyopathy Registry, a total of 209 patients fulfilled the criteria for infl-CMP using endomyocardial biopsy (â‰¥14 infiltrating inflammatory cells/mm To conclude, this study suggests that immunosuppressive therapy in infl-CMP patients results in an improved heart transplantation-free survival as compared with standard heart failure therapy alone, underscoring the urgent need for a large prospective multicenter trial.
