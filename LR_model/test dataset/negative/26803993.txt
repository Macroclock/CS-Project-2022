Late primary transplantation in complex congenital heart disease. Heart transplantation is a viable option for patients with congenital heart disease who manifest heart failure, predominantly post-surgical palliation. We present a case of complex congenital heart disease, where surgical palliation was considered not to be an option. Considerate medical management with close follow-up allowed for a nine-yr delay until eventual successful heart transplantation. The case also highlights the natural history over nine yr of the effects of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction on the left ventricular remodeling which is analogous to a PA banding in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.
