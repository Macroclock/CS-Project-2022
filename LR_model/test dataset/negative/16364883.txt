Heart transplantation for progressive cardiomyopathy as a manifestation of MELAS syndrome. Mitochondrial diseases represent a heterogeneous group of disorders associated with a wide array of clinical manifestations. The presentation of patients with mitochondrial pathology largely depends upon the dysfunction of organ systems with large metabolic/energy requirements, including cardiac, neurologic, and musculoskeletal. In particular, mitochondrial myocardial disease can be progressive resulting in congestive heart failure and end-stage heart disease. This article reviews the role of heart transplantation for a particular variant of mitochondrial disorder, mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, and discusses perioperative management issues related to transplantation for mitochondrial cardiomyopathies.
