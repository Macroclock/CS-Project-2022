Heart transplantation following donation after circulatory death: Expanding the donor pool. Heart transplantation from donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors is a rapidly expanding practice. In this review, we describe the history and challenges of DCD heart transplantation and overview the procurement protocols and methods of limiting ischemic injury, current outcomes, and future directions. There are now at least three protocols that permit resuscitation and viability assessment of the DCD heart either in situ or ex situ. While the retrieval protocol for hearts from DCD donors will depend on local regulations, the outcomes of DCD heart transplant recipients reported to date are excellent regardless of the retrieval protocol and are comparable to the outcomes of heart transplant recipients from donation after brain death (DBD) donors. In the two centers with the largest published experience, DCD heart transplantation now accounts for one third of their heart transplant activity. With international trends indicating that there is an increasing utilisation of the DCD pathway, it is expected that DCD donors will become a major source of heart donation worldwide.
