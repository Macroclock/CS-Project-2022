Coronary artery bypass graft surgery during heart transplantation. We report the case of a patient who was submitted to coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) during heart transplant as, during bench exploration, the donor heart presented a palpable atherosclerotic lesion in the anterior descending artery, not detected before harvesting. The patent internal thoracic artery from a previous CABG was used.
