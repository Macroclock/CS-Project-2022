PCSK9 inhibition in patients with heart transplantation: A case series. PCSK9 inhibitors are potent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering medications. There is a lack of data regarding safety and efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors in cardiac transplant patients. In this case series, we provide data supporting the low-density lipoprotein-lowering efficacy and short-term safety of PCSK9 inhibitors in three cardiac transplant patients.
