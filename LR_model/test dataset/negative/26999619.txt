Relationship between ventricular pressure and coronary artery disease in asymptomatic adult heart transplant recipients. The association between data of right heart catheterization and cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) in adult heart transplant (HTx) recipients remains to be determined. This is an observational, retrospective study, including all consecutive asymptomatic HTx patients undergoing routine right and left catheterization. The independent predictive power of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) to predict CAV (classified according to working formulation of a standardized nomenclature for CAV-2010) was the primary end point. Seventy-one patients were included, with a mean time from HTx to procedure of 19 ± 25 months. At coronary angiography first degree of CAV was found in eight patients (11.2%), second degree of CAV in two patients (2.8%), and third in two (2.8%). PCWP values were significantly higher in patients with CAV compared with patients without CAV (17.5 ± 7.5 vs. 10.4 ± 5.6, P < 0.001) and values of 15 mmHg or greater had an AUC of 0.71 (0.48-0.92), with a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 73% in predicting CAV, with an independent relationship confirmed at logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 1.28, IC 1.06-1.53; P = 0.008). A significantly elevated PCWP at the time of the diagnosis of transplant coronary artery disease may be considered as an early marker of CAV, especially in asymptomatic HTx recipients.
