Everolimus plus dosage reduction of cyclosporine in cardiac transplant recipients with chronic kidney disease: a two-year follow-up study. The calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine (CSA) displays nephrotoxic side effects. We switched 95 maintenance heart transplant recipients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3-4 from CSA to everolimus (EVL). The CSA dosage was reduced by 50%. Kidney function, lipid metabolism, and cardiac function investigated during a 2-year follow-up were compared with heart transplant recipients with CKD stages 2-3 who continued to receive CSA (CSA group; n = 84). Whereas 64/95 patients received reduced CSA plus EVL during the entire follow-up period (EVL continued subgroup, ECN), 31 discontinued EVL (EVL discontinued subgroup, EDS) after 4.3 months (median) because of various clinically relevant adverse events. Glomerular filtration rates (estimated using the modification of diet in renal disease formula) increased by 4.0 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in the ECN subgroup but decreased by 2.4 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and 9.0 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in the EDS subgroup and the CSA group, respectively (P < .001). Triglyceride and total cholesterol concentrations increased significantly among the ECN group, but remained constant in the EDS subgroup and the CSA group. Statin use was increased by 15% in the ECN group (P < .01). Mortality and cardiac rejection rates did not differ significantly among the 3 groups. In summary, EVL combined with low-dose CSA had modest beneficial effects on kidney function in heart transplant recipients with CKD stages 3-4. A significant percentage of patients had to stop EVL because of various adverse events.
