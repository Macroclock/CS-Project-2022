Suppression of (5R)-5-hydroxytriptolide (LLDT-8) on allograft rejection in full MHC-mismatched mouse cardiac transplantation. (5R)-5-hydroxytriptolide (LLDT-8) is a new compound derived from triptolide, which is the major immunosuppressive fraction of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. F (TWHF). Studies in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated that LLDT-8 had potent immunosuppressive activities. Here we tested LLDT-8 in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched cardiac transplantation and investigated the mechanisms underlying the prevention of transplant rejection. LLDT-8 was administered orally to recipients in Balb/c to C57BL/6 murine cardiac transplantation model. Allograft survival after transplantation was recorded in recipients. The T cell immunity and cytokine production were observed. Histological analysis was performed. The chemokine and its receptor were analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on cardiac graft RNA. LLDT-8 administered orally significantly induced the survival prolongation of allogeneic cardiac graft. Histological results showed that LLDT-8 well preserved myocardium and significantly reduced infiltration of the graft with inflammatory cells. LLDT-8 decreased IL-2 production in recipient splenocytes stimulated by concanavalin A (ConA) ex vivo. LLDT-8 significantly inhibited the immunoreactivity of recipient to specific donor alloantigens, but preserved immunity to third-party alloantigens and mitogen. However, the flow cytometry analysis of the proportion of CD4+, CD8+ T cell subgroup in recipient spleens showed LLDT-8 had a normalizing effect on the splenic lymphocytes population. LLDT-8 decreased CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and their ligands macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1alpha) and beta (MIP-1beta) mRNA expressions in allografts. The results outline the great potential of LLDT-8 as a therapeutic tool in transplant rejection.
