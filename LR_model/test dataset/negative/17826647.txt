Summary health status measures in advanced heart failure: relationship to clinical variables and outcome. Patient-centered health status measures are important because they capture the patient's perspective on their heart failure, but it is unclear which of these have independent prognostic significance. A total of 142 consecutive subjects from a specialty heart failure clinic were assessed at baseline with a broad array of clinical, laboratory, and self-report measures including four summary measures of health status. The relationships between these measures and their association with the combined end point of transplantation or death over a mean follow-up of 3 years were examined. In unadjusted analyses, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) summary score had the strongest association with the combined end point (HR [for each unit score difference] = 0.98 [0.96-0.99], P = .002). In the adjusted Cox proportional hazards model including all 4 summary measures, the Seattle Heart Failure Score, V0(2,) systolic blood pressure, and medical comorbidity, only the Standard Gamble utility remained significantly associated with time to the combined end point (HR [for each 0.01 utility score difference] = 0.98 [0.97-0.99], P = .007). Our study suggests that summary health status measures are simple and significant indicators of prognosis in advanced heart failure patients. The KCCQ summary score summarizes a wide range of clinical variables from the patient's point of view, whereas the standard gamble utility contains important prognostic information not captured in usual clinical variables.
