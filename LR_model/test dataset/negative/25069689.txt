Does renal dysfunction and method of bridging support influence heart transplant graft survival? Renal insufficiency is common in status 1B patients supported with inotropes or a continuous flow left ventricular device (CF-LVAD) as a bridge to heart transplantation. We evaluated the association of renal function and inotrope versus CF-LVAD support on posttransplant graft survival in status 1B patients. The Scientific Registry for Transplant Recipients database was analyzed for posttransplant survival in status 1B patients bridged with inotropes or CF-LVAD who underwent transplantation between 2003 and 2012. Pretransplant renal function was measured by estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and was stratified as less than 45 mL · min(-1) · 1.73 m(-2), 45 to 59, and 60 or greater. Univariate Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression models were used to evaluate the main effects of GFR strata and inotropes versus CF-LVAD, and the interaction effect of GFR strata by CF-LVAD, on graft survival. This study included 4,158 status 1B patients (74% male, aged 53 ± 12 years). Of those, 659 patients had a CF-LVAD (HeartMate-II [Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA], n = 638; HVAD [HeartWare, Framingham, MA], n = 21), and 3,530 were receiving inotropes (31 CF-LVAD patients were also receiving inotropes). Kaplan-Meier analyses demonstrated reduced graft survival (p = 0.022) in patients with pretransplant GFR less than 45 versus GFR 45 to 59 (p = 0.062) and versus GFR 60 or greater (p = 0.007), and no effect of inotrope versus CF-LVAD support on graft survival (p = 0.402). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that, after adjusting for the main effects of GFR stratum, CF-LVAD, and inotropes, status 1B patients bridged with a CF-LVAD and GFR in the lowest stratum had reduced graft survival (interaction effect p = 0.040). Pretransplant renal insufficiency was associated with reduced posttransplant graft survival in status 1B patients. This risk is increased for patients bridged with a CF-LVAD (versus inotropes) who have GFR in the lowest stratum.
