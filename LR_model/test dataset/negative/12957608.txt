Bcl-2-mediated inhibition of apoptosis in rat cardiac allografts worsens development of graft coronary artery disease. We hypothesized that adenovirally mediated Bcl-2 transfection of donor hearts would reduce the apoptosis that occurs during acute rejection while worsening the development of chronic graft coronary artery disease (GCAD). PVG donor hearts were treated with either AdvBcl-2 or AdvNull virus before heterotopic transplantation into ACI rats. Bcl-2 expression was assessed on post-operative day 4 (POD) 4 by western blot. Apoptosis was measured using (99m)Technetium-bound-annexin V imaging and caspase 3 activity assay. Allograft survival was determined in a separate cohort of animals. Long-term-treated animals were then assessed for measures of GCAD on POD 90. Western blot analysis showed upregulation of Bcl-2 expression in AdvBcl-2-treated hearts. (99m)Tc-annexin V images demonstrated decreased uptake in the AdvBcl-2 group (1.41 +/- 0.33% vs 1.94 +/- 0.37%, p = 0.026). Caspase 3 activity was also significantly lower in this treatment group (0.112 +/- 0.032 vs 0.204 +/- 0.096, p = 0.049). Allograft survival was similar in both groups, respectively (7.7 +/- 1.2 vs 6.8 +/- 1.5 days, p = 0.340). GCAD, as determined by percent luminal narrowing (5.9 +/- 6.1% vs 1.6 +/- 1.5%, p = 0.039), intima-to-media ratio (5.1 +/- 5.1% vs 1.5 +/- 1.7%, p = 0.040) and percent of affected vessels (15.1 +/- 9.9% vs 5.3 +/- 4.4%, p = 0.009), was higher for the AdvBcl-2 group. Treatment of cardiac allografts with AdvBcl-2 resulted in a reduction of apoptosis that did not significantly improve short-term graft survival, but worsened chronic GCAD.
