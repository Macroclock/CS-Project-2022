Reduced atrial emptying after orthotopic heart transplantation masquerading as restrictive transmitral Doppler flow pattern?*. An elevated early (E) to late (A) diastolic filling velocities ratio, typically seen in advanced diastolic dysfunction, has also been observed after cardioversion of atrial fibrillation as a consequence of the depressed left atrial (LA) contractility. We hypothesized that the impaired LA contractile function demonstrated after orthotopic cardiac transplantation (OCT) could also lead to this "pseudorestrictive" pattern. E/A ratio related to the tissue Doppler early mitral annular velocity (Ea) as preload-independent index of LV relaxation was evaluated in all consecutive OCT patients between 2005 and 2007. The study population comprised 48 patients 97 ± 77 months after OCT. Thirty-two patients (67%) had an E/A ratio > 2. LV systolic function and myocardial relaxation assessed by the Ea velocity were similar compared to patients with normal ratio (61 ± 6% vs. 60 ± 12%, P = 0.854 and 15 ± 4 cm/s vs. 14 ± 3 cm/s, r = 0.15, P = 0.323, respectively). On the other hand, the proportion of the recipient and donor LA cuffs as estimated by the recipient/global LA area ratio and the LA emptying fraction significantly correlated with the E/A ratio (r = 0.40, P = 0.005 and r =-0.33, P = 0.022, respectively). Our study shows that there is a high prevalence of elevated E/A ratio after standard OCT which seems mainly related to reduced LA contractility. Recognition of this "pseudorestrictive" pattern may avoid misdiagnosis of diastolic dysfunction.
