Protective effect of prostaglandin E2 receptors EP2 and EP4 in alloimmune response in vivo. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is produced during inflammatory responses mediating a variety of both innate and adaptive immune responses through 4 distinct receptors: EP1 to EP4. The use of gene-targeted mice and selective agonists/antagonists responsible for each receptor has gradually revealed that each receptor plays a unique and important role in various disease conditions. In addition, PGE2 is known to have some immunosuppressive properties. In this study, we investigated the role of PGE2 receptors by examining the therapeutic efficacy of highly selective receptor agonists on the alloimmune response in vivo. We used a fully major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched murine cardiac transplantation model. C57BL/6 cardiac allografts were heterotopically transplanted into BALB/c recipients. We treated mice with a highly selective agonist for each EP receptor. EP2 and EP4 agonists significantly prolonged allograft survival compared with controls. In particular, the EP4 agonist was more effective than the EP2 agonist in the inhibition of acute allograft rejection. In conclusion, PGE2 receptors merit further study as novel therapeutics for clinical transplantation.
