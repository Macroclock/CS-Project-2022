The complex role of iNOS in acutely rejecting cardiac transplants. This review summarizes the evidence for a detrimental role of nitric oxide (NO) derived from inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and/or reactive nitrogen species such as peroxynitrite in acutely rejecting cardiac transplants. In chronic cardiac transplant rejection, iNOS may have an opposing beneficial component. The purpose of this review is primarily to address issues related to acute rejection, which is a recognized risk factor for chronic rejection. The evidence for a detrimental role is based upon strategies involving nonselective NOS inhibitors, NO neutralizers, selective iNOS inhibitors, and iNOS gene deletion in rodent models of cardiac rejection. The review is presented in the context of the impact on various components, including graft survival, histological rejection, and cardiac function, which may contribute to the process of graft rejection in toto. Possible limitations of each strategy are discussed in order to understand better the variance in published findings, including issues related to the potential importance of cell localization of iNOS expression. Finally, the concept of a dual role for NO and its downstream product, peroxynitrite, in rejection vs immune regulation is discussed.
