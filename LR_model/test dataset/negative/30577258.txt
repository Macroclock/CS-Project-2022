Underutilization of Donor Hearts: An Observational Study. Utilization of donor hearts remains insufficient. In this observational study, we explored the rate and reasons of rejection of cardiac donors in 1 organ procurement organization. Donors were enrolled in the study for 1 year, from October 5, 2014, through October 4, 2015. Data on demographics, medical history, and diagnostic tests were collected. We compared continuous variables between groups using a Mann-Whitney U test, and categorical variables using the Ï‡ Of 134 adult hearts, only 39.5% were transplanted. Moreover, almost half (46.9%) of non-transplanted hearts were normal by all data available. In 12 (31.5%) of all hearts, coronary artery disease was discovered by pathology, making them unusable for transplantation. Overall, 26 normal hearts (19.4%) were not accepted for transplantation. The most common abnormality of hearts not suitable for transplantation was a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). In about one-fifth of donors with low LVEF on the first echocardiogram, LVEF improved on a second echocardiogram. In a majority of cases with low LVEF, echocardiogram was never repeated. Almost 20% of normal donor hearts were not transplanted. Coronary artery disease was the most common abnormality in seemingly normal hearts. Coronary angiography should be performed more liberally in potential donors. Decreased LVEF was the most common reason for not using a heart. Since impaired LVEF may be reversible, repeated echocardiogram is encouraged in order to maximize the rate of transplantation.
