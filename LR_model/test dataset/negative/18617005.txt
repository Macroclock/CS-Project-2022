Quilty in biopsy is associated with poor prognosis after heart transplantation. We tested if Quilty (endocardial infiltration of lymphocytes) in routinely processed endomyocardial biopsy is associated with poor outcome after heart transplantation (HTx). Biopsies (n=9829) harvested within the first post-transplant year from 938 patients (778 men, mean age 49 years) were evaluated for Quilty and acute cellular rejection (according to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, ISHLT, classification). Transplant vasculopathy was evaluated by coronary angiography, and severe stenosis was found in 19% of patients. Survival was tested by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses for all-cause mortality and major cardiac events (lethal acute cellular rejection, graft loss or myocardial infarction). We found 1840 (19%) Quilty-positive biopsies in 487 Quilty-positive patients (52%). Quilty was more prevalent in women (p=0.038) and younger men (p=0.001), and was correlated with ISHLT grade 1R (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.36-1.55; p<0.001) and ISHLT grade 2R (OR 2.48, 95% CI 2.21-3.41; p<0.001). Quilty in any biopsy was associated with a higher all-cause mortality (log rank p=0.045) due to a higher risk for major cardiac event (p=0.0001). Multivariate regression analysis showed Quilty (RR 1.69, 95%CI 1.05-2.73) and transplant vasculopathy (RR 2.78, 95%CI 1.68-4.61) as risk factors for major cardiac events and treated hyperlipidemia as lowering the risk for major cardiac events (RR 0.47, 95%CI 0.28-0.77). Quilty is associated with graft loss and poor outcome post HTx. Index biopsy during the first post-transplant year is a useful tool to identify patients at risk and is recommended during routine post-transplant management.
