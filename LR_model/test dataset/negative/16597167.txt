Everolimus: a review of its use in renal and cardiac transplantation. Everolimus (Certican) is an orally administered mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (proliferation signal inhibitor) derived from sirolimus (rapamycin), which is used as part of immunosuppressant therapy in kidney and heart transplantation. When evaluated as part of triple therapy with ciclosporin and corticosteroids, everolimus showed equivalent efficacy to mycophenolate mofetil after renal transplantation, and superiority to azathioprine in cardiac transplant recipients, in terms of reducing efficacy failure after transplantation. Everolimus potentiates ciclosporin-associated nephrotoxicity, and it is recommended that concentration-controlled everolimus is used with reduced-dosage ciclosporin in order to limit renal toxicity while retaining immunosuppressive efficacy. Ongoing trials with everolimus, such as the evaluation of ciclosporin-withdrawal strategies, should help clarify its optimal usage. The use of everolimus may be associated with reduced rates of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Available data suggest that everolimus may be cost-neutral for healthcare providers.
