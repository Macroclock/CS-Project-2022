Renal protection strategies after heart transplantation. Renal dysfunction caused by calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) nephrotoxicity occurs often and contributes significantly to late mortality after heart transplantation (HTx). Over the last decades, this has prompted many clinical studies in an effort to develop kidney-protecting immunosuppressive strategies including delayed CNI start, minimization, withdrawal, or even de novo CNI avoidance. In the past, these strategies often failed due to the lack of efficacy. Since 2009, novel CNI-reducing strategies have been under investigation. These strategies minimize renal damage using induction agents such as antithymocyte globulin and alternative immunosuppressive agents such as the mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors (sirolimus or everolimus) or mycophenolate. This review outlines the recent results of using these renal protection strategies including their drawbacks. We also discuss alternative approaches to optimize individual immunosuppressive therapies after HTx.
