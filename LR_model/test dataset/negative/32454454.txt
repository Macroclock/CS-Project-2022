Pulmonary vascular resistance as a potential marker of reactive pulmonary hypertension reduction following sildenafil therapy in patients disqualified from orthotopic heart transplantation. We sought to determine the predictors of restoration of heart transplantation (HTx) candidacy in patients with systolic heart failure (HF) and reactive fixed pulmonary hypertension (RFPH) defined as pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) > 2.5 Wood units (WU), transpulmonary gradient (TPG) > 12 mmHg or ≤2.5 WU with systolic arterial pressure ≤85 mmHg during vasoreactivity test, following sildenafil therapy. Between 2007 and 2018 1136 patients were evaluated at our department as candidates for HTx. Thirty-five of them, who presented with systolic HF and were not eligible for HTx due to RFPH, were included in the study (31 men aged 55.1 ± 7.4 years). In all the patients sildenafil was introduced and up-titrated to a maximal tolerated dose in addition to optimal medical therapy. Patients were assessed at 3-6 months intervals. During median 11 months (interquartile range 6-18 months) reduction of RFPH enabling qualification for HTx was observed in 62.9% patients. Higher baseline PVR (OR 0.32; 95% CI (0.14-0.74) p < 0.001), pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) (OR 0.94, 95% CI (0.88-0.99) p = 0.05), mean artery pulmonary pressure (mPAP) (OR 0.87, 95% CI (0.77-0.98) p = 0.02) and TPG (OR 082, 95% CI (0.70-0.96) p = 0.003) were negative predictors of RFPH reduction with sildenafil therapy. In multivariable analysis, lower PVR (p = 0.02) was identified as an independent predictor of RFPH reduction following sildenafil therapy. Sildenafil therapy can support PH reduction in systolic HF patients uneligible for HTx due to RFPH. Lower baseline PVR was identified as an independent predictor of PH reversibility with sildenafil enabling restoration of HTx candidacy. 'Heart transplantation', 'Pulmonary hypertension', 'Sildenafil'
