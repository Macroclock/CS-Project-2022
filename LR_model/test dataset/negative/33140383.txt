Heart failure in Poland: Left ventricular assist device destination therapy and other challenges of interventional cardiology and cardiac surgery. Patients with severe heart failure (HF), who are not eligible for cardiac transplantation and receive optimal medical management, based mainly on the use of pharmacological treatment and devices such as resynchronization therapy (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator), achieve poor clinical outcomes and constitute a group with extremely poor prognosis. Currently, the technology used in the latest generation left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), such as the HeartMate 3, makes it possible to achieve patient survival at the level obtained by patients after heart transplantation, and they can be used not only in patients eligible for heart transplantation as a bridge to transplant, but also in those with significantly worse prognosis, who are ineligible for heart transplantation as destination therapy. The objective of this publication is to present recommendations from experts in cardiology and cardiac surgery, supported by clinical trial results, on the use of LVADs as a destination therapy in HF patients who are not eligible for cardiac transplantation. The paper also presents the issue of cardiac transplantation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy in Poland, as well as current challenges faced by interventional cardiology and cardiac surgery in Poland.
