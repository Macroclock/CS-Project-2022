Fatal disseminated infection by Gymnascella hyalinospora in a heart transplant recipient. We report the first case of disseminated infection by Gymnascella hyalinospora in a solid organ transplant recipient. This case highlights the role of low-virulence environmental molds as an emerging cause of breakthrough invasive fungal infection in immunocompromised hosts. Nosocomial strategies of infection control including antimicrobial stewardship and advances on fast diagnostic methods are strongly encouraged to improve patient prognosis.
