[Vasculopathy of the grafted heart: the synergism of proinflammatory and proatherogenous factors and viral infection]. The authors analyze the pathogenetic significance of hyperhomocysteinemia, antiphospholipid syndrome, the hyperexpression of cell adhesion molecules, inflammation, and oxidative disorders for, as well as the role of viral infections in the development of coronary artery disease of the grafted heart. The paper shows that viral infections in recipients lead to the development of proinflammatory, proatherogenous, and prothrombogenous status, expressing themselves in an increase in the corresponding laboratory markers in recipients' blood plasma, and points out the role of viral infection in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease of the transplanted heart. Control and treatment of viral infections, as well as pharmacocorrection of proinflammatory, proatherogenous, and prothrombogenous status would made it possible to influence the development of coronary artery disease of the grafted heart.
