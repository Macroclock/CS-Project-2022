Contemporary management of patent foramen ovale in patients undergoing ventricular assisting devices or heart transplantation. With the increasing use of surgical and percutaneous left assisting devices and heart transplantation there is the potential risk that unrecognized patent foramen ovale, an entity present in 25-30% of a normal population, causes life-threatening hypoxemia. This syndrome is caused by patent foramen ovale with two different main mechanisms in patients following left assisting device implantation and heart transplantation. The correct management of patent foramen ovale in patients scheduled for left assisting device or heart transplant has not been established. The authors proposed an algorithm in order to manage this clinical condition in the light of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools and guidelines for patent foramen ovale treatment.
