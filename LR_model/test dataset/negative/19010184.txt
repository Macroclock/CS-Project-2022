Health-related quality of life evolution in patients after heart transplantation. We analyzed the evolution of the health-related quality of life during the first year after heart transplantation (HT). A prospective, longitudinal study was performed in 13 heart transplant recipients who were assessed at four different stages: at inclusion on the HT waiting list and at 3, 6, and 12 months after receiving the graft. The instruments used were a structured interview and the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey. The results showed that, compared with pre-HT, there was progressive improvement in physical, psychologic, and social areas post-HT and that health-related quality of life was stable 6 months after receipt of the graft.
