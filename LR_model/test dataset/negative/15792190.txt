Tricuspid valve repair for biopsy-induced regurgitation in a heart transplant recipient. Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a frequent complication after heart transplantation. The etiology of TR is multifactorial, but biopsy-induced flail leaflet is one of the most important mechanisms. A 61-year-old woman underwent heart transplant, but experienced several rejection episodes which required multiple surveillance endomyocardial biopsies. At three months after transplant, she required tricuspid valve repair due to symptomatic severe TR. The anterior leaflet was flail, with rupture of primary and secondary chordae. Valve repair was performed with a triple leaflet edge-to-edge technique. The procedure consisted of suture fixation of the prolapsed anterior leaflet joining to the septal and posterior leaflets, and placement of a 30-mm annuloplasty ring. The patient was uneventfully discharged home on day 7 with trivial TR. At a four-years post-transplant evaluation, she was in NYHA functional class I, with preserved ventricular function and trivial TR. She has been followed closely because of post-transplant coronary artery disease.
