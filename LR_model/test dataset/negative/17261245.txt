[Epidemiology of transplantation in Spain]. During 2005, 1546 true solid organ donors were registered in Spain, yielding a rate of 35.1 per million population (pmp), which places our country at the head of word-wide donation rates. A total of 2200 kidney transplantations were performed in Spain during 2005, 72 of them in infants and children. The cadaveric kidney transplantation rate was 47.9 pmp, the highest in the world for this type of transplant. The 2005 Spanish Renal Transplant Registry showed that patient mortality associated with these transplants is 1.6%. Graft survival is 90% to 84% at the first year and 76% to 66% at 5 years. Furthermore, in 2005, 1070 liver transplantations (24.1 pmp) were carried out. Patient survival in this group is 81.3% the first year, 73.3% at 3 years, 56.7% at 10 years and 26.8% at 20 years. A total of 287 heart transplantations were undertaken (6.5 pmp). Patient survival is 86% to 81% the first year, and around 70% at 5 years. There were 167 lung transplantations, 112 double and 55 single lung transplants. Patient survival in this population is 79.3% the first year and 45.2% at 5 years. Lastly, pancreas transplant activity has increased considerably in recent years, with 96 transplants during 2005.
