Alemtuzumab for cytolytic induction of immunosuppression in heart transplant recipients. To review available evidence about the safety and efficacy of alemtuzumab for induction of immunosuppression in heart transplant recipients. Searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were conducted. Key search terms included alemtuzumab, Campath-1H, CD52, lymphocyte, cytolytic, induction, immunosuppression, rejection, and cardiac transplantation. Additional pertinent data were identified through a search of abstracts from major transplant meetings. All English-language articles and abstracts identified from the data sources were evaluated. All primary data were eligible for inclusion if they evaluated the safety or efficacy of alemtuzumab for induction of immunosuppression in heart transplant patients. One retrospective cohort, 1 case series, 1 case-control series, and 1 open-label trial were identified and included for review. Acute cellular rejection occurs in 40% to 70% of heart transplant recipients within the first 6 months after transplant and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Depleting and nondepleting antibodies have displayed positive outcomes in inducing immunosuppression; however, the ideal induction strategy that balances efficacy and toxicity remains elusive. Alemtuzumab, a cytolytic anti-CD52 antibody, has been used to induce immunosuppression in kidney, pancreas, liver, intestine, and lung transplant recipients, and its use in heart transplant has been investigated. Studies of use of alemtuzumab to induce immunosuppression in heart transplant patients have shown low rates of rejection; however, it has not been directly compared with other immunosuppression-inducing agents and safety data are limited. Although alemtuzumab may be a practical option for inducing immunosuppression, data are insufficient to recommend its routine use in deference to more established agents. Large, randomized clinical trials with extended durations of follow-up must be conducted to characterize its efficacy and safety further.
