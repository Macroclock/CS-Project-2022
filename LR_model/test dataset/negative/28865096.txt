The predictive value of coronary artery calcium detected by computed tomography in a prospective study on cardiac allograft vasculopathy in heart transplant patients. The predictive value of coronary artery calcium (CAC) in heart transplant (HTX) patients is not established. We explored if the absence of CAC on computed tomography (CT) could exclude moderate and severe cardiac allograft vasculopathy [CAV 'computed tomography', 'coronary artery calcium', 'heart transplantation', 'long-term outcome', 'vasculopathy'
