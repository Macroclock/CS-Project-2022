Post-transplant outcome in patients bridged to transplant with temporary mechanical circulatory support devices. The new heart allocation system in the United States prioritizes patients supported by temporary mechanical circulatory support (TMCS) devices over those with uncomplicated durable continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVADs), which may increase the number of patients bridged to transplant with TMCS. Limited data are available in guiding post-transplant outcomes with various TMCS devices. We sought to describe post-transplant outcome and identify clinical variables associated with post-transplant outcome in patients bridged to transplant with TMCS. Using data from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Thoracic Transplant Registry, we included subjects who underwent transplantation between 2005 and 2016 with known use of mechanical circulatory support. Pre-transplant recipient, donor, and transplant-specific variables were abstracted. The primary outcome was patient survival at 1-year post-transplant. Outcomes of patients bridged to transplant with TMCS were compared with those of patients bridged with CF-LVADs. Cox regression analyses were performed to identify clinical variables associated with the outcomes. There were 6,528 patients bridged to transplant with the following types of mechanical circulatory support: durable CF-LVADs (n = 6,206), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, n = 134), percutaneous temporary CF-LVADs (n = 75), surgically implanted temporary CF-LVADs (n = 38) or surgically implanted temporary BiVAD (n = 75). Bridging with ECMO (hazard ratio 3.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.69-5.34, p < 0.001) or percutaneous temporary CF-LVADs (hazard ratio 1.83, 95% CI 1.09-3.08, p = 0.02) was independently associated with higher risk of mortality. Additional risk factors included older donor age, female/male donor-recipient match, older recipient age, higher recipient body mass index, higher recipient creatinine, and prolonged ischemic time. This analysis of a large international cohort of patients bridged to transplant with mechanical circulatory support identified ECMO and percutaneous temporary CF-LVADs as predictors of mortality after transplant, along with additional donor and recipient clinical characteristics. These findings may provide guidance to clinicians in decisions on mechanical circulatory support device selection, transplant eligibility, and timing of transplant.
