Leo Fabian: A Life of Accomplishment. Leo Fabian played a role in many anesthesia firsts: the first halothane anesthetics in the United States, the first American electrical anesthetic, the first lung allotransplant, and the first heart xenotransplant. As was common for men of his generation, Fabian's first taste of medicine came during World War II, as a pharmacist's mate aboard the U.S.S. Bountiful. Afterward, he pursued his medical education before joining Dr. C. Ronald Stephen and the anesthesiology department at Duke. There he helped to create one of the first inhalers for halothane, the Fabian Newton Stephen (F-N-S) Fluothane Vaporizer. Fabian left Duke for the University of Mississippi Medical Center, where he consistently worked with the chair of surgery, Dr. James Hardy. Together they performed the first American electrical anesthetic, the first lung allotransplant, and the first heart xenotransplant. By the end of his time at Mississippi, Fabian and Hardy had several philosophical disagreements, and Fabian ultimately left for Washington University in St. Louis, where he rejoined Dr. Stephen. He served as Stephen's right-hand man and would oversee the department when Stephen was away. Fabian spent the final years of his career as chair of the department before his own health forced him to step down.
