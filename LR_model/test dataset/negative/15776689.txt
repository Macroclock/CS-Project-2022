Selection of congestive heart failure patients for heart transplant. Heart failure is one of the most common causes of hospitalization in adult patients. With the recent technological advances and the use of new medications for controlling rejection, heart transplant has been established as a definite therapeutic measure for properly selected patients with advanced congestive heart failure. As there is an active transplant program in the Cardiovascular Center of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, this review is intended to acquaint the practicing physician with the required work up and management of patients referred for cardiac transplant. Emphasis is given to indications, clinical and psychosocial evaluation, optimization of medical therapy and to the absolute and relative contraindications.
