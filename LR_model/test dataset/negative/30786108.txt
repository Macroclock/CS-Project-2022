Gastrostomy tubes appear to be safe following pediatric orthotopic heart transplant. Gastrostomy tube (GT) placement is a common pediatric surgical procedure typically indicated for oral aversion. This may develop in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) who require an orthotopic heart transplant (OHT). The safety profile of GT placement in OHT patients who are immunosuppressed is unknown. Given the potential increased risk of wound site complications on a patient receiving immunosuppression, we sought to determine the safety profile of GT placement in pediatric patients with OHT. We performed a retrospective case series of all pediatric OHT recipients who subsequently underwent GT placement from January 1, 2009, to August 1, 2018, at the University of Virginia Children's Hospital. Major GT complications of wound breakdown, wound infection, peristomal GT leakage, ileus, or persistent emesis, and minor GT complication including the presence of granulation tissue are reported. Six patients who had a pediatric OHT subsequently underwent GT placement over the study period. There were no major 30-day or 90-day GT complications. One patient had excessive granulation tissue at their GT site. There were no accounts of acute kidney injury, urinary tract infection, sepsis, or pneumonia. Gastrostomy tube (GT) placement appears to be safe in pediatric OHT patients who are on immunosuppressive medications and unable to feed orally. This is the first study documenting the safety profile of GTs in pediatric OHT patients and may aid clinicians to make decisions regarding this intervention.
