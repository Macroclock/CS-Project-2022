Durable circulatory support with a paracorporeal device as an option for pediatric and adult heart failure patients. Not all patients in need of durable mechanical circulatory support are suitable for a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device. We describe patient populations who were treated with the paracorporeal EXCOR, including children with small body sizes, adolescents with complex congenital heart diseases, and adults with biventricular failure. Information on clinical data, echocardiography, invasive hemodynamic measurements, and surgical procedures were collected retrospectively. Differences between various groups were compared. Between 2008 and 2018, a total of 50 patients (21 children and 29 adults) received an EXCOR as bridge to heart transplantation or myocardial recovery. The majority of patients had heart failure compatible with Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support profile 1. At year 5, the overall survival probability for children was 90%, and for adults 75% (P = .3). After we pooled data from children and adults, the survival probability between patients supported by a biventricular assist device was similar to those treated with a left ventricular assist device/ right ventricular assist device (94% vs 75%, respectively, P = .2). Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy had a trend toward better survival than those with other heart failure etiologies (92% vs 70%, P = .05) and a greater survival free from stroke (92% vs 64%, P = .01). Pump house exchange was performed in nine patients due to chamber thrombosis (n = 7) and partial membrane rupture (n = 2). There were 14 cases of stroke in eleven patients. Despite severe illness, patient survival on EXCOR was high, and the long-term overall survival probability following heart transplantation and recovery was advantageous. Treatment safety was satisfactory, although still hampered by thromboembolism, mechanical problems, and infections.
