Intraoperative Acute Multivessel Coronary Vasospasm in Cardiac Allograft: A Case Report. We present a patient who developed acute intraoperative cardiac failure requiring open cardiac message immediately after uncomplicated heart transplantation. After successful resuscitation and establishment of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, coronary angiography showed diffuse multivessel coronary vasospasm, which responded to intracoronary and IV administration of vasodilators. Cardiac function gradually improved and the patient was discharged home after a prolonged hospital course. Cardiac allograft dysfunction associated with coronary vasospasm immediately after heart transplantation has not previously been reported.
