Native T This study aimed to determine the role of T Endomyocardial biopsy (EMBx), the current gold standard to diagnose cardiac allograft rejection, is associated with potentially serious complications. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-based T Patients underwent CMR within 24 h of EMBx. T Of 112 biopsies with simultaneous CMR, 60 were classified as group 0 (ISHLT grade 0), 35 as group 1 (ISHLT grade 1R), and 17 as group 2 (2R, 3R, clinically diagnosed rejection, antibody-mediated rejection).
