Incidence, predictors, and outcomes of extubation failure in children after orthotopic heart transplantation: a single-center experience. The objective of this study is to describe the incidence, etiologies, predictors, and outcomes of extubation failure in children undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). A Retrospective, observational study was designed to evaluate clinical outcomes. . The study was conducted in a cardiovascular intensive care unit (CVICU) setting at a single, tertiary care, academic children's hospital. We collected demographic, pre-operative, intra-operative, post-operative and peri-extubation data in a retrospective, observational format from patients who underwent OHT at our institution. Clinical outcomes evaluated included the success or failure of extubation, CVICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, and in-hospital mortality. We utilized descriptive and univariate statistics to compare the group with extubation failure to the group with extubation success. There were no interventions in this study. During the study period, 127 patients qualified for inclusion. The median age of patients was 108 months [interquartile range (IQR): 25-169] and median weight was 23 kg (IQR: 10.6-48). Extubation failure occurred in 12.5 % (16/127) of the patients. Median duration of mechanical ventilation was 2 days (IQR: 1-4.5), median CVICU LOS was 7 days (IQR: 5-13), and the median hospital LOS was 36 days (IQR: 20-74). Overall in-hospital mortality was 2 % (2/127). There was a significant improvement in blood pressure (p < 0.001) with a decrease in inotropic score (p < 0.001) after removal of positive pressure ventilation among the patients with extubation success. Independent factors associated with extubation failure included lower body weight, need for mechanical ventilation prior to heart transplantation, renal failure prior to extubation attempt, and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction prior to extubation attempt. Our study demonstrates that extubation failure in patients after OHT is infrequent and the causes are diverse. Extubation success in children after OHT is associated with improvement in mean arterial blood pressure, decrease in inotropic support, and decrease in supplemental oxygen requirement.
