HDAC11 regulates interleukin-13 expression in CD4+ T cells in the heart. Immune deregulation is a causative factor in pathogenesis of myocarditis. Histone deacetylases (HDAC) involve multiple biochemical activities in the cell. This study aims to elucidate the role of HDAC11 in the regulation of interleukin (IL)-13-expression in CD4 After heart transplantation, surgically removed hearts were collected from patients with advanced heart failure and MCD or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). CD4 T helper (Th) 2-biased inflammation was observed in hearts tissue of MCD patients with advanced heart failure. CD4 HDAC11 is a regulatory molecule in Th2 response and plays a critical role in the restriction of the biased IL-13 expression in CD4 'HDAC11', 'Heart', 'Inflammation', 'Myocarditis', 'Th2'
