Psychosocial Evaluation of Candidates for Heart Transplant and Ventricular Assist Devices: Beyond the Current Consensus. Advanced heart failure therapies, including heart transplantation and durable mechanical circulatory support, are available to a limited number of patients because of the scarcity of donors, expense, and large burden of care. The importance of psychological and social determinants of health, including cognitive status, health literacy, psychopathology, social support, medical adherence, and substance abuse, are emphasized in advanced heart failure and further amplified in the context of mechanical circulatory support and heart transplantation. The psychosocial assessment of advanced heart failure therapy candidates remains largely subjective, requiring a multidisciplinary evaluation, which may include psychiatrists, social workers, case managers, financial coordinators, pharmacists, and clinicians. Objective tools-including the Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplantation, Psychosocial Assessment of Candidates for Transplantation, and Transplant Evaluation Rating Scale-were developed and validated in limited populations to help standardize the evaluation process. Small, retrospective studies have inconsistently shown that these tools may predict clinical outcomes in the transplant population, with higher-risk scores associated with readmissions, rejection episodes, and infections. However, it has been more difficult to show that these tools can predict mortality, and their applicability to the mechanical circulatory support population is less studied. The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation released a consensus statement in 2018 to promote consistency of psychosocial evaluation across advanced heart failure programs, but it lacks specific recommendations given the current state of evidence. This state-of-the-art review expands on the current consensus by critically reviewing current studies supporting available objective assessment tools, proposing a psychosocial evaluation framework that uses a multidisciplinary approach and offering future directions for research.
