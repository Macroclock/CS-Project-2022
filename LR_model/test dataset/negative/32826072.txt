Clinical utility of genetic testing in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most frequent cause of heart transplantation. The prevalence of familial disease can reach 50%. Our objective was to describe the genetic basis of DCM in a cohort with a high proportion of transplanted patients. We included patients with DCM and genetic testing performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) that included at least 80 genes. Clinical data, family history and genetic results were retrospectively analysed. When possible, assessment of first-degree relatives was carried out. Eighty-seven DCM patients and 308 relatives from 70 families were evaluated. Clinical prevalence of familial disease was 37% (32 patients). Forty-four percent of patients (38 patients) had required heart transplantation. A relevant variant was found in 43 patients (49%), 25 patients (29%) carried variants of unknown significance and in 19 patients (22%) the study was negative. Most genetic variants were found in sarcomeric genes and the yield of genetic testing was higher in patients with familial DCM. The yield of genetic testing in our DCM cohort was high, reaching 69% in familial cases. Mutational spectrum was heterogeneous and the identification of the specific aetiology of the disease often provided prognostic information.
