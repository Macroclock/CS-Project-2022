Maturity and adherence in adolescent and young adult heart recipients. Pediatric transplant (txp) teams note high rates of non-adherence and risky behaviors linked to morbidity and mortality among adolescent and young adult recipients. Clinicians and parents alike report symptoms of social immaturity and failure to appreciate consequences of risky behavior; relationships between the two have not been studied in this population. This two-phase mixed method study examined adherence, high-risk behaviors, and maturity in a sample of 27 heart recipients, aged 15-31, who underwent transplantation in childhood or adolescence at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. All subjects completed a projective ego development measure and a questionnaire about adherence to the post-txp regimen. Nine recipients, purposely selected for good or poor adherence according to criteria determined by the transplant team and matched on age, participated in phase 2 qualitative interviews and mood assessments. Sixty-three percent of the phase 1 sample missed medications, 67% missed appointments, 11% smoked, 37% had difficulty with diet, 89% exercised infrequently, 33% had tattoos, 26% had more than two body piercings, and 11% used street drugs. Six themes and a core construct of maturity were identified with qualitative methodology. Poor adherers were less mature on every theme and consistently scored at a less mature level on the projective measure of ego development. Chronological age was not related to the level of maturity in qualitative or projective data. Most interview subjects reported high levels of anxiety, and two reported clinically significant levels of depression and anger; mood was not related to adherence. Non-adherence and high-risk behaviors are prevalent among adolescent and young adult heart recipients. Level of maturity appears to be associated with ability to adhere to the treatment regimen and avoid high-risk behaviors.
