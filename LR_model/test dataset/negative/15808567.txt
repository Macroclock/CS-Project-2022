Catechins attenuate myocardial cell infiltration and fibrosis but do not prolong graft survival in murine cardiac allografts. Although tea catechins have many biological functions, their effects on cardiac allograft rejection have not been well studied. We used a total allomismatch heart transplant model to test the effects of catechins in cardiac rejection. We have shown that cell infiltration and fibrosis were suppressed in catechin-treated allografts compared with nontreated transplants. However, catechins did not statistically prolong graft survival. We conclude that catechins have a potential to suppress inflammation in cardiac allografts.
