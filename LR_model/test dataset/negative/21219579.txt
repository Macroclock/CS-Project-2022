Clinical aspects of intravenous immunoglobulin use in solid organ transplant recipients. Intravenous immunoglobulin products (IVIG) are derived from pooled human plasma from thousands of donors and have been used for the treatment of primary immunodeficiency disorders for nearly 30 years. IVIG products are also effective in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, however the precise mechanism(s) of immune modulation are unknown. Recent data suggests that IVIG has a much broader ability to regulate cellular immunity, including innate and adaptive components. IVIG is also a recently recognized modifier of complement activation and injury. These attributes suggests IVIG would have clinical applications in solid organ transplantation. Analysis of clinical studies examining the use of IVIG in desensitization protocols and for treatment of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) are supportive for kidney transplant recipients, although no clinical trials using IVIG in sensitized patients were performed seeking an Federal Drug Administration indication. Data regarding the use of IVIG for desensitization and treatment of AMR in cardiac and lung allograft recipients is not conclusive. IVIG is useful in the treatment and prevention of posttransplant infectious complications including cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19 and polyoma BK virus. In addition, we address the risk of adverse events associated with IVIG use in sensitized end-stage renal disease and transplant patients.
