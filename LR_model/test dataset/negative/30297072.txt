Impact of Mechanical Circulatory Support on Posttransplant Outcomes. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has markedly improved the likelihood of transplant among patients with advanced heart failure. Transplant survival following MCS is similar for supported and unsupported recipients. Transplant survival is only reduced following left ventricle assist device (LVAD) support complicated by infection, total artificial heart support, and extracorporeal life support. Despite allosensitization and a higher incidence of vasoplegia syndrome, posttransplant survival for durable LVADs is similar to patients with inotropes alone at the time of transplant. MCS as a bridge to transplant offers significant benefits over waiting without support.
