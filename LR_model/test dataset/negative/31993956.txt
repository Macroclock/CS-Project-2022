Validation of multiparametric rubidium-82 PET myocardial blood flow quantification for cardiac allograft vasculopathy surveillance. We previously demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy of Rubidium-82 positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial blood flow (MBF) quantification for CAV. The purpose of this study was to validate multiparametric PET detection of CAV by combined rate-pressure-product-corrected myocardial flow reserve (cMFR), stress MBF, and coronary vascular resistance (CVR) assessment. Diagnostic CAV cut-offs of cMFR < 2.9, stress MBF < 2.3, CVR > 55 determined in a previous study (derivation) were assessed in heart transplant recipients referred for coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) (validation). CAV was defined as International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation CAV We validate the diagnostic accuracy of multiparametric PET flow quantification by cMFR, stress MBF, and CVR for CAV.
