A novel in vivo model using immunotoxin in the absence of p-glycoprotein to achieve ultra selective depletion of target cells: Applications in trogocytosis and beyond. A commonly employed method to determine the function of a particular cell population and to assess its contribution to the overall system in vivo is to selectively deplete that population and observe the effects. Using monoclonal antibodies to deliver toxins to target cells can achieve this with a high degree of efficiency. Here, we describe an in vivo model combining the use of immunotoxins and multidrug resistant (MDR) gene deficient mice so that only MDR deficient cells expressing the target molecule would be depleted while target molecule expressing, but MDR sufficient, cells are spared. This allows targeted depletion at a higher degree of specificity than has been previously achieved. We have applied this technique to study trogocytosis, the intercellular transfer of cell surface molecules, but this principle could also be adapted using technology already available for use in other fields of study.
