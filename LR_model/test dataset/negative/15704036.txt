Heart failure in children -- mechanical assistance. The use of mechanical circulatory support for the treatment of heart failure in the pediatric population has become increasingly important in pediatric heart surgery units; however, the treatment options for the pediatric population have not attained the same level of technological development as we have seen for the adult population. The use of mechanical assistance as a bridge to transplantation or a bridge to recovery are the main indications for mechanical circulatory support in infants and children. The problem of organ donor shortage is even worse compared to the situation in the field of adult heart transplantations. Especially in Europe however, newly developed pulsatile, paracorporeal ventricular assist devices designed for long-term assist in children have demonstrated their ability to provide excellent results beyond the abilities of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and centrifugal pumps, which are still the mainstay of mechanical support in children worldwide. Especially in the group of the smallest patients, the use of the most appropriate form of circulatory assistance has to be carefully considered as the co-incidence of respiratory failure as well as other complex physiological situations will severely influence the outcome.
