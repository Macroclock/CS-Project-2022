Prolonged basiliximab use as an alternative to calcineurin inhibition to allow renal recovery late after heart transplantation. Solid-organ transplant patients can have a number of complications, some of which are particularly severe with regard to morbidity and mortality. These complications may be due to operative and post-operative complications or to the immunosuppressive therapy regimen. Renal impairment is a frequent post-transplant complication that may occur for any number of reasons, including peri-operative ischemic events and nephrotoxicity secondary to anti-rejection medications. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) in particular can lead to acute renal failure (ARF). There are no clear guidelines for the management of ARF after heart transplantation. Different strategies include delaying initiation of CNI therapy post transplant, and the use of anti-CD25 monoclonal antibodies.
