Nur77 is involved in graft infiltrating T lymphocyte apoptosis in rat cardiac transplantation model. Acute allograft rejection is initiated by a large number of recipient T cells that recognize donor alloantigens. Apoptotic signals trigger Nur77 production. Nur77 translocates from the nucleus to the mitochondria to induce a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of mitochondrial cell-death mediators, including HtrA2/Omi. In this study, we investigated the relationship between Nur77, HtrA2/Omi, and T lymphocyte apoptosis during acute allograft rejection in a rat cardiac transplantation model. The median survival time of the isograft group was longer than that of the allograft group. The cardiac grafts in isogenic (Lewis to Lewis) and allogenic (Wistar to Lewis) models were subjected to HE stain, showing that no rejection occurred in the isografts and that the rejection level was increased in allografts. Compared with the rare expression in syngeneic Lewis rat hearts by western blot analysis, Nur77 protein level in allograft increased from day 1, peaked at day 5 after transplantation, and maintained the highest level until day 7. Double immunofluorescence staining on allograft tissues at day 5 showed Nur77 immunocompetence in most CD3(+) cells, and Nur77 positive T cells also showed HtrA2/Omi-positive signal. Meanwhile, active caspase-3 was apparent in these HtrA2/Omi-positive T cells. Immunohistochemical results suggested that both Nur77 and active caspase-3 were expressed in increasing infiltrating lymphocytes. Our results demonstrated that upregulated Nur77 may promote graft-infiltrating T lymphocyte apoptosis by translocating and inducing HtrA2/Omi release from mitochondria in acute rejection after cardiac transplantation.
