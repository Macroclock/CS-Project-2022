Successful whole blood exchange by apheresis in a patient with acute cyclosporine intoxication without long-term sequelae. Acute cyclosporine A (CsA) intoxication after organ transplantation may occur during the changeover from one form of drug to another, or from miscalculation of dosage. Sometimes, it may cause severe hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. However, the therapeutic plasma exchange for the CsA intoxication was not established. Here, we present a case of very severe CsA intoxication after cardiac transplantation who recovered from intoxication without long-term sequelae via whole blood exchange; therapeutic erythrocytapheresis followed by total plasma exchange.
