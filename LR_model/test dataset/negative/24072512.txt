Critical appraisal of costly therapy modalities for heart failure in a developing country. Contemporaneous challenges in heart failure management include strategies to rationally use health economic resources and relative donor shortage to adequately offer electric devices (cardiac resynchronization therapy [CRT] and implantable cardioverter defibrillators [ICD]), ventricular assist devices (VADs) and heart transplant, respectively. These issues are particularly important in countries with middle-income rates and limited structured heart transplant centers, such as Brazil. Use of CRT and ICDs need to follow strict guidelines, further customized to public financial health conditions. Experience with VADs in is the early days in Brazil and will require extreme caution to allocate health public resources to develop VAD programs in highly selected centers. Chagas' disease is epidemiologically important in Brazil; outcomes of patients with Chagas' on electric devices are unclear while these patients fare better post-transplant than non-Chagas' patients. Thus, heart transplant remains an attractive option regarding both favorable outcomes and resource allocation for advanced heart failure patients in Brazil.
