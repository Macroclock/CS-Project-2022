Support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for over 1 year duration as a bridge to cardiac transplantation: a case report and review of the literature. We present the case of a 13-year-old male with a complex congenital cardiac history who was supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 394 days while awaiting cardiac transplantation. The patient underwent successful cardiac transplantation after 394 days of support with veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and is currently alive 2 years after cardiac transplantation. We believe that this case represents the longest period of time that a patient has been supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a bridge to cardiac transplantation.We also review the literature associated with prolonged support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. This case report documents many of the challenges associated with prolonged support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, including polymicrobial bacterial and fungal infections, as well as renal dysfunction. It is possible to successfully bridge a patient to cardiac transplantation with prolonged support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation of over 1 year; however, multidisciplinary collaboration is critical.
