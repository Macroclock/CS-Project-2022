Cardiac sarcoidosis and heart transplantation: a report of four consecutive patients. Heart transplantation (HTx) is a well-established treatment for severe cardiac failure. However, HTx for cardiac sarcoidosis is rare; less than 80 patients have been reported worldwide. In many patients, the diagnosis was not made prior to HTx. The aim of this study was to describe the use of HTx in the treatment of severe cardiac sarcoidosis. The series was comprised of four Caucasian patients (1 male, 3 females), aged 25-57 years. HTx were performed in the period 1990-2006. None of the patients had clinically overt extra-cardiac sarcoidosis. In one patient the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was proven prior to HTx. In three patients, all with dilated cardiomyopathy due to myocardial sarcoidosis, the final diagnosis was obtained by examination of the explanted heart. Arrythmias (supraventricular and ventricular), heart block, mitral valve insufficiency and dilated cardiomyopathy were prominent clinical features. None of the patients had recurrence of sarcoid disease in the allograft. Two patients are long-term survivors and two are deceased, one of primary graft failure, the other from Cytomegalovirus myocarditis. In conclusion, HTx is a viable treatment for cardiac sarcoidosis with end stage cardiac failure. Cardiac sarcoidosis is difficult to diagnose. Myocardial biopsy has a low diagnostic sensitivity. However, when the newest non-invasive diagnostic methods, including magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, are applied, an endomyocardial biopsy should not be mandatory to make a diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis.
