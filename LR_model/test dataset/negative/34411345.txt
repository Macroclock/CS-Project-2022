Malignancy among adult heart transplant recipients following patient-tailored dosing of anti-thymocyte globulin: a retrospective, nested case-control study of individualized dosing. Post-transplant malignancy is diagnosed in approximately 18% of heart transplant patients and is a leading cause of death post-transplant. One modifiable risk factor is the type and amount of immunosuppression received. Contemporary rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) dosing strategy using T-cell-guided dosing, and its effect on malignancy in heart transplant patients is unclear. This was a single-center, retrospective chart review of heart transplant recipients receiving rATG for induction. Patients diagnosed with malignancy post-transplant were matched 1:2 to controls using a nested case-control design. The primary endpoint was to determine the relative risk of rATG exposure with the actual incidence of malignancy post-transplant. The secondary endpoint was the impact of maintenance immunosuppression on malignancy risk. Of the 126 patients included in the study, 25 developed malignancy and were matched to 50 control patients. The median cumulative rATG dose in milligrams (mg) between groups was 365 mg in malignancy cases and 480 mg in controls (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75-1.08, P = 0.28). In both the univariate and multivariable analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in malignancy risk found with any maintenance immunosuppressant. The results of this study showed that patient-tailored rATG dosing strategies may not be associated with malignancy development as previously thought.
