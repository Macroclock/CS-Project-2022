Heart transplantation treatment for a malignant cardiac granular cell tumor: 33 months of survival. A malignant granular cell tumor is a high-grade sarcoma with a high rate of metastasis, local recurrence and short survival.

At thirty-three months following this procedure she is alive and free of recurrence.
