Clinical Outcomes of Early Extubation Strategy in Patients Undergoing Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation as a Bridge to Heart Transplantation. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) might be considered a bridge therapy in patients who are expected to have short waiting times for heart transplantation. We investigated the clinical outcomes of patients who underwent VA-ECMO as a bridge to heart transplantation and whether the deployment of an early extubation ECMO strategy is beneficial. Between November 2006 and December 2018, we studied 102 patients who received VA-ECMO as a bridge to heart transplantation. We classified these patients into an early extubation ECMO group (n = 24) and a deferred extubation ECMO group (n = 78) based on the length of the intubated period on VA-ECMO (â‰¤ 48 hours or > 48 hours). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The median duration of early extubation VA-ECMO was 10.0 (4.3-17.3) days. The most common cause for patients to be put on ECMO was dilated cardiomyopathy (65.7%) followed by ischemic cardiomyopathy (11.8%). In-hospital mortality rates for the deferred extubation and early extubation groups, respectively, were 24.4% and 8.3% ( VA-ECMO as a bridge therapy seems to be feasible for deployment in patients with a short waiting time for heart transplantation. Deployment of the early extubation ECMO strategy was associated with reductions in delirium and infection in this population.
