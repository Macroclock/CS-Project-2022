Sub-acute neonatal hemochromatosis in an infant with hypoplastic left heart syndrome on ventricular assist device awaiting transplantation. Single-ventricle pediatric patients, amongst other children waiting for OHT, are a vulnerable population, especially if candidacy is established before any palliation. NH is a rare disease with poor prognosis in the post-natal period. We present a case of sub-acute NH diagnosed in an infant with HLHS who was listed for OHT while bridged with a pulsatile paracorporeal VAD, with an emphasis on the evolution of the condition throughout the patient's clinical course and the ultimate decision for compassionate deactivation of VAD.
