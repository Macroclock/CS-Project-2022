Evaluation of Neuroimaging Findings of Central Nervous System Complications in Heart Transplant Recipients. In this study, we presented neuroradiologic findings and diagnoses of neurologic complications in a series of heart transplant recipients. A retrospective review was conducted at Ba≈ükent University Hospital. We searched the hospital and radiology databases and identified 109 heart transplant recipients. Thirty-one of these recipients had neuroradiologic evaluations secondary to presentation of neurologic symptoms after heart transplant, with 18 patients evaluated with computed tomography and 22 patients evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (overlap of imaging-defined groups occurred in 9 recipients). Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies were retrieved from the Picture Archiving and Communication System, with each type of imaging retrospectively evaluated on consensus by 2 radiologists. Radiopathologic findings related to symptoms were detected in 12 of the 31 study patients. The most common abnormality was posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome (5 patients, 4.6%). The other abnormalities were ischemic stroke (3 patients, 2.8%), hemorrhagic stroke (1 patient, 0.9%), intracranial abscess (2 patients, 1.8%), and intracranial dissemination of sinusoidal fungal infection and related hemorrhagic infarct (1 patient, 0.9%). The other 19 heart transplant recipients who underwent computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging for neurologic complaints showed no neuroradiologic findings related to neurologic symptoms. Posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome and ischemic stroke were the most common neurologic complications in our heart transplant recipients. The other complications were hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial abscess, and intracranial dissemination of sinusoidal fungal infection. Neurologic complications are common in heart transplant recipients and should be identified promptly for early treatment. For the recognition of these complications, computed tomography should be performed for initial evaluation to rule out edema or hemorrhage. However, in the presence of serious neurologic symptoms that cannot be explained by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging should be indicated.
