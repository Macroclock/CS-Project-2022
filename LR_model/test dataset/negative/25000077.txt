Telemedicine systems in organ transplantation: a feasibility and reliability study of the integrated teleradiological and tele-pathological evaluation of the cardiac graft. Aim. Feasibility and reliability of the integrated Tele-Radiological (TRE) and Tele-Pathological (TPE) evaluation of the Cardiac Graft (CG) on Telemedicine Systems. Sensitivity-specificity analysis by a simulation of TRE of CG on 15 MR thoracic images by two radiologists and of TPE by 20 specialists based on total 100 human CG digital images, assessing injuries/trauma and lesions. Integration of TRE and TPE of CG for remote diagnosis showed an accuracy for: injuries/trauma/hematoma=90.9-100%, and non-neoplastic lesions=94.3%. Integration of TRE and TPE of CG is feasible and reliable for Heart Pre-Grafting and Pre-Transplant decision support and planning.
