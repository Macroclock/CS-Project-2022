Predictors of perceived social support in long-term survivors of cardiac transplant: the role of psychological distress, quality of life, demographic characteristics and clinical course. To examine associations between perceived social support, quality of life, psychopathological, demographic and clinical variables in long-term heart transplant survivors. Sixty six patients transplanted from 10.2 Â± 3.3 years completed the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, Symptom Questionnaire and World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF. Parameters of post-transplant medical course were retrieved. Spearman rank order correlation, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test and multiple regression analyses were performed. At multiple regression analyses SQ depression significantly predicted Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL) total and appraisal scores (p = 0.005 and p = 0.047), indicating better satisfaction for support in patients with less depressive symptoms. Low levels of depression and being married or living as married were significantly associated with better ISEL belonging (p = 0.03 and p = 0.008) and self-esteem (p < 0.001 and p = 0.038). Skin cancer significantly correlated with better tangible (p = 0.02) and total (p = 0.05) support. Social quality of life was positively associated with ISEL total (p < 0.01), appraisal (p < 0.05), belonging (p < 0.01) and tangible (p < 0.05) scores; yet, it significantly predicted none of the them. Depressive symptoms may worsen patients' satisfaction for their interpersonal support. Marital status seems to foster sense of belonging and self-esteem. The paucity of significant associations between ISEL and clinical parameters may reflect the caregivers' continuous provision of support regardless of clinical status.
