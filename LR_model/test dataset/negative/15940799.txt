[Establishment of a heterotopic heart transplantation model in mice]. To establish a mouse model of heterotopic heart transplantation. In isotransplantation,BALB/c mice were used as both donors and recipients. In allotransplantation, C57 mice were used as donors and BALB/c mice as recipients. The hearts of donor mice were transplanted into the abdominal cavity of recipient mice, connecting aortic ascent artery of donor mice and abdominal aortic artery of recipient mice, main pulmonary artery of donor mice and inferior vena cava of recipient mice. The mouse model of heterotopic heart transplantation was established successfully with a success rate of 90 %. The mean time of hot ischemia and cold ischemia were (0.9 +/-0.05) min and (34.8 +/-0.7) min, respectively. The survival time of isograft was more than 100 days and that of allograft was (7.7 +/- 0.3) days. The operational procedure of donor heart and the quality of blood vessel anastomosis are two key points for successful heterotopic heart transplantation.
