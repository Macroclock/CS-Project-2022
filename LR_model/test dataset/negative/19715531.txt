Cardiac transplant in a child with recurrent thrombosis due to congenital thrombophilic mutations. A modified Blalock-Taussig shunt had been implanted 3 times to treat cyanosis to a patient who has uncorrectable congenital cardiac deformity. We repaired the entire pulmonary artery, from one hilus to the other, to prevent future stenosis while making cardiac transplant. Our patient was also heterozygous for 2 thrombophilic mutations: methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase C677T and Factor V A4070G. Congenital risk factors should be evaluated in patients who have experienced a thromboembolic event before cardiac surgery.
