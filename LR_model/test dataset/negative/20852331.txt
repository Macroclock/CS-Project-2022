Right ventricular recovery after cervical extra corporeal membrane oxygenation in a four-month-old male leading to left Berlin Heart Excor assistance. A 4-month-old male with cardiogenic shock was implanted with cervical extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). He had a biventricular heart failure associated to multiple organ failure (MOF). Right ventricular (RV) function and MOF recovered during five days ECMO leading to left ventricular assistance device (LVAD) implantation. This case shows the advantages of the double bridge strategy providing intervention time for complications refractory to VAD implantation and evaluation time of right and left ventricular function for potential mono- or bi-VAD implantation. Furthermore, there are no reports describing this strategy in young children leading to RV function recovery and its advantage.
