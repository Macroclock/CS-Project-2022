Current Desensitization Strategies in Heart Transplantation. Heart transplant candidates sensitized to HLA antigens wait longer for transplant, are at increased risk of dying while waiting, and may not be listed at all. The increasing prevalence of HLA sensitization and limitations of current desensitization strategies underscore the urgent need for a more effective approach. In addition to pregnancy, prior transplant, and transfusions, patients with end-stage heart failure are burdened with unique factors placing them at risk for HLA sensitization. These include homograft material used for congenital heart disease repair and left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). Moreover, these risks are often stacked, forming a seemingly insurmountable barrier in some cases. While desensitization protocols are typically implemented uniformly, irrespective of the mode of sensitization, the heterogeneity in success and post-transplant outcomes argues for a more tailored approach. Achieving this will require progress in our understanding of the immunobiology underlying the innate and adaptive immune response to these varied allosensitizing exposures. Further attention to B cell activation, memory, and plasma cell differentiation is required to establish methods that durably abrogate the anti-HLA antibody response before and after transplant. The contribution of non-HLA antibodies to the net state of sensitization and the potential implications for graft longevity also remain to be comprehensively defined. The aim of this review is to first bring forth select issues unique to the sensitized heart transplant candidate. The current literature on desensitization in heart transplantation will then be summarized providing context within the immune response. Building on this, newer approaches with therapeutic potential will be discussed emphasizing the importance of not only addressing the short-term pathogenic consequences of circulating HLA antibodies, but also the need to modulate alloimmune memory.
