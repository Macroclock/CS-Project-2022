Cardiac transplantation: patient selection in the current era. Heart transplantation is a treatment option available to patients with end-stage heart failure who meet standardized selection criteria for transplant. Through a rigorous evaluation process, professionals set out to establish the patient's severity of heart failure, screen for comorbidities that may negatively affect survival, and assess psychosocial variables necessary for successful outcomes following transplantation. Because of a limited donor organ supply, each of these factors must be examined carefully to assure that this scarce resource is used to its greatest potential benefit.
