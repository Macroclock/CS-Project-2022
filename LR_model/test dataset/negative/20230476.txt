Focal atrial tachycardia originating from the donor superior vena cava after bicaval orthotopic heart transplantation. An 11-year-old boy, who underwent bicaval orthotopic heart transplantation for idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, had a focal atrial tachycardia originating from the donor superior vena cava. The pathogenesis of this tachycardia may be related to transplant rejection or transplant vasculopathy. Radiofrequency catheter ablation can eliminate this unique tachycardia and result in hemodynamic improvement.
