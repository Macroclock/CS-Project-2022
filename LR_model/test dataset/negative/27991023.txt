[Heart transplantation and long-term lvad support cost-effectiveness model]. Heart transplantation is a high priority project at Semmelweis University. In accordance with this, the funding of heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support also constitutes an important issue. In this report, the authors discuss the creation of a framework with the purpose of comparing the cost-effectiveness of heart transplantation and artificial heart implantation. Our created framework includes the calculation of cost, using the direct allocation method, calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and creating a cost-effectiveness plane. Using our model, it is possible to compare the initial, perioperative and postoperative expenses of both the transplanted and the artificial heart groups. Our framework can possibly be used for the purposes of long term follow-up and with the inclusion of a sufficient number of patients, the creation of cost-effectiveness analyses and supporting strategic decision-making.
