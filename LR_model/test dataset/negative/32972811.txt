Berlin Heart EXCOR Paediatric Ventricular Assist Device: Does WeightÂ Matter? Berlin Heart EXCOR (BH) ventricular assist devices provide mechanical long-term circulatory support in children with end-stage heart failure, as a bridge to transplantation or to recovery. Most studies are from large-volume paediatric cardiac centres. The aim of this study was to analyse the experiences of three French centres and to compare these with available published data. We performed a retrospective observational study of three paediatric cardiac intensive care units. All children supported with BH devices were included. Morbidity and mortality data were collected and risk factors analysed. Fifty-four (54) patients (54% male) were included. Survival rate was 73% while on a BH device. Median age at BH device implantation was 17 months (range 2-180 months). The predominant indication was dilated cardiomyopathy (61%). Bi-ventricular assist device was used in 25 (46%) cases. The total length of long-term circulatory support was 3,373 days, with a mean length per patient of 62.5 days (range 5-267 days). Thirty-two (32) patients were transplanted (59%) and seven (13%) were successfully weaned. Type and length of support did not influence morbidity. Main complications were renal dysfunction (57%), bleeding (41%), and infection (39%). In multivariate analysis, a weight <5 kg was significantly associated with higher mortality. The weight seems to be the most important risk factor of mortality in this precarious condition. 'Assist device', 'Cardiomyopathy', 'Children', 'Ventricular failure'
