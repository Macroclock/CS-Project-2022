Review of risk factors in four cases of cryptococcosis after heart transplantation. Cryptococcosis is a rare infection with high mortality in patients who have undergone heart transplantation (HT). In this study, we report four cases of the disease selected from our 328 HT cases (1.22%) between 1987 and 2007. The purpose of this study was to review risk factors for cryptococcosis after HT. Three of the four patients were men. The mean time from HT to diagnosis was 8.5 months (range, 3-17 months). Cryptococcosis was subcutaneous in one patient, systemic in one, and meningeal in two. One patient died. The Antifungal regimens included intravenous amphotericin B (amBisone) and oral fluconazole (Diflucan). Patients with diabetes mellitus or renal insufficiency, are hepatitis B carriers, have undergone repeat HT, or are receivings steroid therapy are susceptible to cryptococcosis. The recommend anticryptococcal therapy is amphotericin B, followed by oral fluconazole for at least 6 months. Early diagnosis with aggressive diagnostic techniques and a combination of therapies must be considered to reduce the risk of death in HT recipients with cryptococcosis.
