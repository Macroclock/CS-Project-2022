Surgical treatment for heart failure: left ventricular restoration for cardiomyopathy. Congestive heart failure has become a major problem and the only surgical treatment for end-stage heart failure caused by dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) had been heart transplantation. However, because of the shortage of donors, several procedures for non-transplant surgery have been developed. Published literature on left ventricular (LV) restoration was searched to review the new surgical procedures for treating patients with ischemic or non-ischemic DCM. LV restoration was initiated in the 1980s for repairing LV aneurysm. In the 1990s several surgical procedures were introduced for treating DCM, and the new evolving surgical treatment plays an important role in the management of DCM in the 21st century.
