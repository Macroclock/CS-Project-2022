Implementation of Heart Transplantation Program to Advanced Heart Failure Patients in Brazil. Heart transplantation is the gold standard treatment for advanced heart failure. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), despite being a good option for these patients, are not quite available in developing countries. Time spent in heart transplant waiting list has increased lately even in regions where the number of transplants has also risen showing that a new strategy should be sought. Transplant process organization combined with multidisciplinary work are linked to better outcomes while improvement in donor's care and in pre-transplant evaluation might be opportunities to change the long waiting list scenario. For the first time in Brazil, a survey with the most expressive heart transplant centers has been made, which allows an overview of treatment of advanced heart failure in a developing country. We also described a model of heart transplant team, which has proved to be a success when compared to the largest heart transplant centers in Latin America.
