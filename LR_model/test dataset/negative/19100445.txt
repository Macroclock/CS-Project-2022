Ocular complications of heart transplantation in a Chinese population. The purpose of this study was to investigate ocular complications among a group of patients on long-term, high-dose immunosuppression and corticosteroids for the maintenance of orthotopic heart transplants. Additionally, we provided information pertinent for the early diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases. In this study, we retrospectively assessed the clinical data of 138 patients with orthotopic heart transplantations from May 2000 to October 2005, including assessment of ophthalmic symptoms and signs, as well as the general condition, treatment, and prognosis. Of 138 transplant recipients examined (276 eyes), 47 eyes (17.0%) showed ocular surface diseases. Sixty-four (23.2%) had a posterior subcapsular cataract, and 16 (5.8%) corticosteroid glaucoma. Fifteen (5.6%) had ocular fundus diseases. Various ocular complications related to immunosuppression and corticosteroids appear among heart transplant patients. Cardiac surgeons and ophthalmologists must closely evaluate ocular symptoms in the posttransplantation period.
