The role of timely measurement of galectin-3, NT-proBNP, cystatin C and hsTnT in predicting prognosis and heart function after heart transplantation. Changes of biomarkers measured soon after heart transplantation (HTx) can reflect different processes: cardiomyocyte necrosis (troponins, high-sensitivity cardiac TnT and TnI), heart function (natriuretic peptides, BNP and NT-proBNP), fibrosis (galectin-3 and ST2), and global cardiorenal risk (cystatin C). We assessed the prognostic role of hsTnT, NT-proBNP, galectin-3 and cystatin C during the early post-transplant period. A total of 121 consecutive post-HTx patients were assessed. The main outcomes were survival, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and rejection periods. Survival was assessed after intermediate (12 months) and long periods (total follow-up during study, median of survival 763 days, IR 527-1038 days). LVEF was assessed 12 months after HTx. Rejection was evaluated during follow-up. We report biomarker concentrations measured 10 days and 12 months after HTx. Ten days after HTx, cystatin C and hsTnT predicted death both under univariable and multivariable analysis. These two biomarkers along with galectin-3 were increased in patients with decreased LVEF measured 1 year after HTx. NT-proBNP did not show early prognostic power. None of the measured biomarkers predicted rejection, but hsTnT and NT-proBNP were increased significantly 12 months after HTx in patients with at least one rejection. Cystatin C and hsTnT measured 10 days after HTx can provide prognostic information on survival and galectin-3 measured at the same time may display a relationship to heart function assessed 1 year after HTx. Further study should be carried out in a large cohort of patients.
