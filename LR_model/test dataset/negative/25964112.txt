Mapping strategy for multiple atrial tachyarrhythmias in a transplant heart. Different atrial arrhythmias can coexist in the recipient and donor atria after heart transplantation. We report an unusual case of a patient with three different types of atrial arrhythmia after heart transplantation: an atrial fibrillation in the recipient atria, and a cavotricuspid isthmus dependent atrial flutter and a focal atrial tachycardia in the donor atria. 3D electroanatomical mapping and ablation were guided by remote magnetic navigation (RMN). Atrial fibrillation continued in the recipient atria even after the donor heart was converted to sinus rhythm by ablation. It is critical to understand the surgical anatomy of a bi-atrial anastomosis and its relevant electrical activation pattern before ablation. Appropriate electroanatomical mapping strategy with RMN can facilitate the successful ablation of post-transplant atrial arrhythmias.
