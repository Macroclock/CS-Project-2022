Angiogenesis on coronary angiography is a marker for accelerated cardiac allograft vasculopathy as assessed by intravascular ultrasound. Errant neovascularization and coronary artery fistulae (CAF) are frequently observed after cardiac transplantation. The relationship between angiographic neovascularization/CAF and coronary plaque progression is unknown. Angiography and intravascular ultrasound were routinely performed at 4-6 weeks and 1-year post-transplant. Pts were divided into three groups: no angiographic angiogenesis (Group 1), neovascularization only (Group 2), and CAF (Group 3). First-year changes in maximal intimal thickness (MIT), maximal intimal area (MIA), and percent atheroma volume (PAV) were compared between groups. The 106 pts were included, 40/106 in Group 1, 42/106 in Group 2, and 24/106 in Group 3. Respectively, first-year ΔMIT was 0.14 ± 0.13 mm, 0.32 ± 0.26 mm, and 0.50 ± 0.34 mm, P < .001. ΔMIA was 0.6 ± 0.6 mm Neovascularization and CAF are commonly present on surveillance angiography after cardiac transplantation and may signify amplified angiogenesis. Their presence is associated with accelerated coronary plaque progression by IVUS.
