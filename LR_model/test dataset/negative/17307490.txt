Successful use of the Toyobo left ventricular assist device in a 16-kg girl awaiting cardiac transplantation. In Japan, no mechanical circulatory support is available for children. We report a case of terminal stage cardiac failure in a 16-kg girl who was implanted with an adult-sized Toyobo-NCVC left ventricular assist device (Toyobo-National Cardiovascular Center, Osaka, Japan) in our unit. She successfully underwent heart transplantation in the United States 5 months later.
