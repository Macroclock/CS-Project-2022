[Atrial flutter after orthotopic heart transplantation due to recipient-to-donor transatrial conduction]. A few weeks after orthotopic heart transplantation, a male adolescent developed atrial arrhythmias of the donor heart due to an atypical recipient atrial flutter with a recipient-to-donor transatrial conduction resulting in an absolute arrhythmia. Under medication with propafenone, the atrial flutter of the donor heart could be terminated with cardioversion.
