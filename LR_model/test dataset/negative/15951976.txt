Mechanical circulatory support devices (MCSD) in Japan: current status and future directions. The current status and future directions of mechanical circulatory support devices (MCSDs) in Japan are reviewed. Currently used clinical MCSDs, both domestic and imported systems and continuous flow devices that are coming into the clinical arena are emphasized. Clinical MCSDs include the extracorporeal pulsatile Toyobo and Zeon systems and the implantable Novacor and HeartMate I VE. A thorough review is presented of single-ventricle continuous flow MCSDs such as the Terumo DuraHeart and the SunMedical EVAHEART and the biventricular Miwatec/Baylor systems that are on the horizon. The future directions in management of end-stage cardiac patients with MCSDs are discussed, focusing on (1) device selection - pulsatile versus continuous flow devices; (2) single-ventricle support, biventricular support, or replacement; (3) bridge to transplantation, destination therapy, or bridge to recovery; and (4) government regulatory processes and the medical industry. We hope to promote the quality of life (QOL) of end-stage cardiac patients as well as the medical industry in Japan.
