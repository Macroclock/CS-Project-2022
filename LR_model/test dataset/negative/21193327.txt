Normal left ventricular mechanical function and synchrony values by speckle-tracking echocardiography in the transplanted heart with normal ejection fraction. The purpose of this study was to describe the normal values for strain (S), systolic strain rate (SRs) and synchrony by speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) in heart transplant (HTx) recipients who had normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and no clinically significant complications. We evaluated S and SRs in 40 HTx patients at 1 year after transplant and 82 healthy controls with STE using velocity vector imaging. Mean (SD) global longitudinal S and SRs, respectively, were lower in the transplant group compared with controls [-13.43% (2.39%) vs -17.28% (2.30%), p < 0.001; -0.83 (0.15) s(-1) vs -0.96 (0.13) s(-1), p < 0.001]. These variables were good for differentiating between groups: area under the curve was 0.88 for S and 0.73 for SRs. The differences remained significant after adjustment for other clinical variables. Global circumferential S and SRs were similar between groups. The standard deviation of the global longitudinal S time to peak of the 16 segments for HTx and control groups, respectively, was 41.67 (13.53) milliseconds vs 32.57 (12.81) milliseconds (p < 0.001). With 58.2 milliseconds as a cutoff value to define left ventricular synchrony, only 3 (8%) of the HTx patients and 4 (5%) of the control subjects were above that value (p = 0.6). To our knowledge, this is the first study describing normal values for S and SRs and synchrony by STE in a HTx population with normal LVEF: longitudinal S and SRs were reduced; circumferential deformation indexes were normal; and left ventricular synchrony was preserved.
