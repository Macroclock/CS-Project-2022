Post-operative conversion from cyclosporine to tacrolimus in heart transplantation: a single-center experience. Tacrolimus is a potent calcineurin inhibitor that was introduced to heart transplantation in the early 1990s. The side-effect profile of tacrolimus is more favorable than that of cyclosporine and some reports have suggested an advantage of tacrolimus in the treatment of rejection. The present study was undertaken to determine whether a late conversion to tacrolimus affords these benefits to heart transplant recipients. Charts from 109 patients who underwent conversion from cyclosporine to tacrolimus for recurrent rejection or adverse effects were retrospectively reviewed. During the year after conversion to tacrolimus, there was a significant decrease in treated rejection episodes. Conversion to tacrolimus rapidly resulted in an improved lipid profile. Two years after conversion blood pressure was significantly reduced. Apart from rejection, these benefits were found mainly among individuals converted to tacrolimus within 1 year of heart transplantation. Conversion from cyclosporine to tacrolimus is safe and results in a more favorable risk factor profile. However, most of the benefits are seen in individuals converted within 1 year of transplantation.
