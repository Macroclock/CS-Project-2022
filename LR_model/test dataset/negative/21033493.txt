[Non-medical therapy in heart failure: instrumental treatment and cardiac transplantation]. Circulatory support devices and cardiac transplantation are closely interlinked and are the treatment of severe heart failure refractory to medical therapy. In acute situation, ECMO allows stabilization of unstable hemodynamic situation related to cardiogenic shock. In patients who require longer term support, the use of continuous flow pumps is associated with better survival and better quality of life. Those pumps can be used either as a bridge to transplantation or as a bridge to recovery but also as destination therapy. Early implantation before occurrence of severe right heart failure allows preferential use of LVAD. Approximately 350 cardiac transplantations are performed every year in France. Indication in based on several criteria appreciating the severity of functional impairment. Contra-indications have to be discussed case by case, and chronologic age should not be a too rigid limit. High urgency list allows transplanting the sickest patients in priority. Conditional half-life in patients surviving the first year post transplantation is 12 years. Mechanical circulatory support and cardiac transplantation should be used as complementary treatment of severe heart failure in order to avoid progressive but sometime irreversible deterioration of patients with chronic heart failure.
