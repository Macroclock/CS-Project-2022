Intracranial peripherally enhancing lesions in cardiac transplant recipients: A rare case series and literature review. Intracranial peripherally enhancing lesions in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients represent a unique diagnostic and management dilemma due to the vast array of differentials that demand consideration. Diagnosis of the underlying pathology is often guided by the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We present the first published case series of three cardiac transplant recipients with significantly atypical neuroradiological findings contrary to the tenets of contemporary literature. Our rare case series consists of: (1) A sterile Mycobacterium pyogenic abscess mimicking glioblastoma multiforme due to an immunosuppressed state (2) Epstein Barr Virus encephalitis masquerading as Central Nervous System Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (3) An unusual case of partially treated disseminated Nocardiosis warning of the need to consider the immunosuppressed state and partial treatment response obfuscating classical MRI appearances. We utilise these unprecedented cases as the basis of a literature review to understand the pathophysiology behind the peculiar imaging findings in this rarefied cohort of transplant recipients, and rationalise why the MRI findings in each instance contradicts the accepted imaging patterns. In the setting of potential unreliability of neuroradiology in this immunosuppressed unique subgroup, we hope to impart to clinicians that definitive diagnosis obtained by emergent neurosurgical intervention may be necessary to accurately and expediently guide further medical management.
