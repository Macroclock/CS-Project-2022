[Dynamic changes of Smac/DIABLO protein expression in rat donor myocardium suffered from hypothermic preservation]. To investigate the effect of different duration of hypothermic preservation on the expression of Smac/DIABLO protein in rat hearts. The Langendorff model of isolated rat heart was used. After stored in 4 degrees C Celsior solution for different time (0, 3, 6, 9 or 12 h), the activity of SOD and the content of MDA in heart mitochondria were measured. Cell apoptosis was detected by TUNEL technique. The expression of Smac/DIABLO protein was also analyzed by Western blotting. (1) After hypothermic preservation, the activity of SOD was decreased and the content of MDA was increased in rat hearts in a time-dependent manner. (2) Prolonged the hypothermic preservation, the percentage of apoptotic cell also enhanced. (3) After long-term of cold preservation, the expression of Smac/DIABLO protein increased at 3-6 h of preservation but decreased after 9 h. Prolonged the hypothermic preservation might lead to the expression of Smac/DIABLO protein and induce cardiomyocytes apoptosis, which may in turn result in malfunction of cardiomyocytes.
