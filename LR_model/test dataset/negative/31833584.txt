Comparison of outcomes in lung and heart transplant recipients from the same multiorgan donor. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) and acute cellular rejection (ACR) are important causes of early morbidity and mortality following lung and heart transplantation. While many studies have elucidated donor-related risk factors of PGD and ACR, these complications often occur even with "ideal" donors. Therefore, we investigated potential associations of PGD and ACR between bilateral lung and heart transplant recipients from the same multiorgan donor, respectively. Between 2011 and 2017, 100 donors contributed 100 bilateral lung transplants and 100 heart transplants performed. Logistic regression analysis for PGD and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis for ACR were used to estimate the relationship of heart and lung transplants. The incidence of PGD was 33% among lung and 17% among heart transplant recipients. Similarly, the incidence of ACR grade ≥ A2 for lung recipients was 38% (30/80), and the incidence of ACR grade ≥ 2R for heart recipients was 19% (15/80). There was no association between the development of PGD and ACR in lung and heart transplant recipients from the same donor, respectively. These findings suggest that inherent donor factors are not critical to the development of PGD and ACR after lung and heart transplantation.
