Incidence and impact of herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus detection in the respiratory tract after lung transplantation. Herpesvirus infections cause morbidity in lung transplant recipients. The study was conducted to investigate the incidence and impact of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) detection in the respiratory tract (RT) of lung and heart-lung transplant recipients (LTR) during the postoperative phase. In a prospective cohort study, 91 LTR having at least 1 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) sent for virus diagnostics were monitored for CMV and HSV detection in NPS during their post-transplant hospital stay on cardiothoracic surgery wards (median 4 weeks) by direct immunofluorescence testing for HSV, virus culture, and CMV and HSV polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) were analyzed with the same protocol except that HSV PCR was only performed on request. Risk factor analysis for the outcome '90-day mortality' was performed. Fifteen LTR had virus detection in NPS (16.5%): 9 had CMV, 5 had HSV, and 1 had both CMV and HSV. Four of 84 LTR had CMV detection in BAL (4.8%). Absence of CMV detection in NPS had a negative predictive value of 98.8% for absence of CMV detection in BAL. HSV DNA detection in NPS, especially if detected within 8 days after transplantation, was associated with 90-day mortality. In conclusion, detection of herpesviruses in the RT was clinically relevant and frequent, despite antiviral prophylaxis.
