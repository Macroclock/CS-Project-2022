Fungal infection in heart-lung transplant recipients receiving single-agent prophylaxis with itraconazole. Heart and lung transplant recipients are at risk for invasive fungal infections. This study evaluated the affect of single-agent antifungal prophylaxis with itraconazole on the rate of fungal infections after heart or lung transplant. An observational, retrospective study was performed to evaluate the rate of fungal infections in heart and lung transplant recipients at the University of Kentucky Medical Center over 4.5 years who received itraconazole as a single therapy prophylaxis. Eighty-three recipients (42 heart, 41 lung) had an overall fungal infection incidence of 16.9% (14/83), while the incidence was 11.9% for heart recipients (5/42), and 22.0% for lung recipients (9/41). Single-agent use with itraconazole in heart or lung transplant recipients did not affect the rate of fungal infection as compared with previous reports. The incidence of fungal infection increased significantly within 3 months after escalation of immunosuppressant for treatment of acute rejection.
