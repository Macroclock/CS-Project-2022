Recurrence of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangitis after orthotopic heart transplant. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangitis (EGPA), previously referred to as Churg-Strauss syndrome, is a necrotizing small vessel vasculitis associated with eosinophilic infiltrates and extravascular granulomas. We report a case of a Caucasian woman successfully bridged to heart transplantation with a continuous flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) who survived recurrence of EGPA in the allograft.
