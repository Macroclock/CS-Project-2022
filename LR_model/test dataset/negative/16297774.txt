The impact of donor gender on cardiac peri-transplantation ischemia injury. Cardiac allografts from female donors have been shown to be associated with increased risk of transplant vasculopathy. However, the influence of donor gender on peri-transplantation ischemic injury has not been evaluated. A total of 361 patients (mean age, 52 +/- 10 years) underwent cardiac transplantation between January 1998 and December 2002. Patients were divided into 4 groups according to their donor-recipient gender status: Group A, male-male, 156; Group B, male-female, 37; Group C, female-male, 114; and Group D, female-female, 54. Serial right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy specimens were evaluated for ischemic injury during the first 4 weeks after transplantation. Patients were similar in baseline characteristics. An increased incidence of ischemic injury complicated by fibrosis (12.9%, p = 0.03) and subsequent development of transplant vasculopathy (Kaplan-Meier 6-year freedom from vasculopathy, 53.4%; p = 0.012) was noted in Group D. No survival difference was observed among the 4 groups, however. In Group D (F-F), 2 patients underwent retransplantation and 2 patients underwent revascularization. The transplantation of a female cardiac allograft into a female recipient is associated with increased risk of ischemic injury complicated by fibrosis and subsequent transplant vasculopathy.
