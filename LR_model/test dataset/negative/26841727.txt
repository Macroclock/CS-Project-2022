Favorable Waitlist and Posttransplant Outcomes in Children and Adolescent Patients Supported With Durable Continuous-Flow Ventricular Assist Devices. Pediatric centers are implanting durable adult continuous-flow ventricular assist devices (CFVADs) in children who are smaller than the industry-recommended size. Waitlist and posttransplant outcomes data in pediatric patients supported with CFVADs as a bridge to transplant are limited. We analyzed the United Network of Organ Sharing and Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network registry to identify patients aged ≤18 years with a CFVAD at the time of listing or transplantation. Patients were stratified by body surface area (BSA; >1.5 vs. ≤1.5 m(2) ) at time of listing. We identified 138 patients with a durable CFVAD during the listing period (100 with BSA >1.5 m(2) , 38 with BSA ≤1.5 m(2) ). Patients with BSA ≤1.5 m(2) were more likely to have a noncardiomyopathy diagnosis (18% vs. 4%, p = 0.007) and to be implanted with a centrifugal-flow rather than an axial-flow device (74% vs. 30%, p = 0.001). There was no difference in failure-free waitlist survival between BSA groups (p = 0.99) among patients with a CFVAD at listing. Posttransplantation survival was 100% and 88% at 1 and 5 years, respectively, for the entire cohort and did not differ by BSA group (p = 0.99). Consequently, waitlist and posttransplant outcomes are favorable for pediatric CFVAD recipients. Small patients (≤1.5 m(2) ) had pre- and posttransplant outcomes similar to those of larger patients that met the industry-recommended size for implantation.
