How to increase the utilization of donor hearts? Cardiac transplantation is the best treatment available for patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy. Shortage of donor hearts is the main factor limiting the use of this treatment. Many donor hearts are rejected for transplantation because of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and/or wall motion abnormalities. While some donors have true cardiomyopathy, a significant proportion has reversible LV dysfunction due to neurogenic stunned myocardium. This condition is triggered by excess of catecholamines, which is typical for brain-dead donors. If given time to recover, LV function may improve, and the heart will be suitable for transplantation. Moreover, limiting of exogenous catecholamines may facilitate the recovery. In this review, we summarize the data on LV dysfunction/wall motion abnormalities in heart donors and propose the strategy to increase the utilization of donor hearts.
