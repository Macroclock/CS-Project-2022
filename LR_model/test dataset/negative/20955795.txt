Transplant long-surviving induced by CD40-CD40 ligand costimulation blockade is dependent on IFN-γ through its effect on CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells. IFN-γ was documented to be commonly associated with acute rejection. In the present study, we investigated the role of IFN-γ in the transplant long-surviving induced by blocking CD40-CD40 ligand (CD40-CD40L) costimulation and its mechanisms. IFN-γ expression in cardiac allografts and spleens from syngeneic and allogeneic recipients with or without anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody (MR-1) treatment was examined by real-time RT-PCR. The grafts survival time in Wild type (IFN-γ(+/+)) and IFN-γ deficient (IFN-γ(-/-)) recipients was investigated. Mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) of CD4(+) T cells and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) assay of CD8(+) T cells were also studied. FoxP3 expression in allografts and spleens from IFN-γ(+/+) or IFN-γ(-/-) recipients with MR-1 treatment was examined. Furthermore, FoxP3, IL-10 and CTLA-4 expressions and the suppressive capability of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells were examined. Rejected allografts showed significantly higher IFN-γ expression than long-surviving allografts. Allograft survival was not prolonged in nonimmunosuppressed IFN-γ(-/-) mice. Administration of MR-1 induced long-term survival in 90.1% of IFN-γ(+/+) recipients (98±6.6 days) but failed to do so in IFN-γ(-/-) group (16.2±4.0 days). IFN-γ(-/-) recipients facilitated the proliferation and CTL generation of T cells. The allografts and spleens from IFN-γ(+/+) recipients contained higher FoxP3 expression than IFN-γ(-/-) recipients. Moreover, CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells from IFN-γ(+/+) recipients displayed a higher FoxP3 and IL-10 expression and suppressive capability. IFN-γ plays an important role in the long-surviving induced by blocking CD40-CD40L through inhibiting the function of activated T cells and increasing suppressive capability of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells.
