Interferon Gamma and Contact-dependent Cytotoxicity Are Each Rate Limiting for Natural Killer Cell-Mediated Antibody-dependent Chronic Rejection. Natural killer (NK) cells are key components of the innate immune system. In murine cardiac transplant models, donor-specific antibodies (DSA), in concert with NK cells, are sufficient to inflict chronic allograft vasculopathy independently of T and B cells. In this study, we aimed to determine the effector mechanism(s) required by NK cells to trigger chronic allograft vasculopathy during antibody-mediated rejection. Specifically, we tested the relative contribution of the proinflammatory cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-Î³) versus the contact-dependent cytotoxic mediators of perforin and the CD95/CD95L (Fas/Fas ligand [FasL]) pathway for triggering these lesions. C3H/HeJ cardiac allografts were transplanted into immune-deficient C57BL/6 rag 'animal models: murine', 'basic (laboratory) research/science', 'cytokines/cytokine receptors', 'immunobiology', 'natural killer (NK) cells/NK receptors', 'rejection: antibody-mediated (ABMR)', 'rejection: chronic'
