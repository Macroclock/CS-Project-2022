Isolation and expansion of thymus-derived regulatory T cells for use in pediatric heart transplant patients. Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) are a subset of T cells generated in the thymus with intrinsic immunosuppressive properties. Phase I clinical trials have shown safety and feasibility of Treg infusion to promote immune tolerance and new studies are ongoing to evaluate their efficacy. During heart transplantation, thymic tissue is routinely discarded providing an attractive source of Tregs. In this study, we developed a GMP-compatible protocol for expanding sorted thymus-derived CD3 'Cell therapy', 'Heart transplant', 'Regulatory T cells', 'Thymus'
