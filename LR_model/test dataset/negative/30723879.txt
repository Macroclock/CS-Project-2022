Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy in Heart Failure Patients with Left Ventricular Assist Device. There is limited data in the literature evaluating outcomes of bariatric surgery in severely obese patients with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as a bridge to make them acceptable candidates for heart transplantation. This study aims to assess the safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in patients with previously implanted LVAD at our institution. All the patients with end-stage heart failure (ESHF) and implanted LVAD who underwent LSG from2013 to January 2017 were studied. Seven patients with end stage heart failure (ESHF) and implanted LVAD were included. The median age and median preoperative BMI were 39 years (range: 26-62) and 43.6 kg/m Patients with morbid obesity, ESHF, and implanted LVAD constitute a high-risk cohort. Our results with 7 patients and result from other studies (19 patients) suggested that bariatric surgery may be a reasonable option for LVAD patients with severe obesity. Bariatric surgery appears to provide significant weight loss in these patients and may improve candidacy for heart transplantation.
