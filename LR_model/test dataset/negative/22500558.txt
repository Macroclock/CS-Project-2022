Cardiac antibody-mediated rejection. Many factors limit short- and long-term survival after pediatric heart transplantation. Historically, attention had been directed toward T-cell responses and acute cellular rejection. Presence of pretransplant antibodies against HLA is associated with increased donor wait times and poor post-transplant outcomes. Therapies aimed to mitigate circulating antibodies include plasmapheresis, protein A immunoadsorption columns, intravenous immune globulin, rituximab, and bortezomib. The negative effects of B cells, HLA antibodies, and AMR and potential interventions are the focus of this review article.
