Hemostasis management in pediatric mechanical circulatory support. In a 9-year-old boy, bridging to transplantation was successful with an external biventricular device, the Berlin Heart Excor (Berlin Heart, Berlin, Germany), during a 7-month period. Main long-term complications consisted of infection and hypercoagulability with clotting inside the chambers necessitating six pump exchanges, but without thromboembolic events. This report reviews hemostasis monitoring and management of long-term mechanical circulatory support.
