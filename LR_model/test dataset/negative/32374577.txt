Update and breakthrough in cardiac xenotransplantation. Considerable advancements have been made in the field of cardiac xenotransplantation in the recent years, achieving prolonged survival of the life-supporting cardiac xenograft and paving the way toward first clinical implications. The combination of genetic modifications and novel immunosuppression with costimulation blockade, as well as supporting therapy with antiinflammatory treatment, growth prevention, and adaptation of the heart procurement system to reduce myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury improves the overall cardiac xenograft function and overall survival in nonhuman primates. Through the newly identified xenoantigens and novel gene-editing techniques, further genetic modification of the porcine xenografts should be explored, to ensure clinical safety. With continuous progress in all fields of cardiac xenotransplantation, first clinical use in humans seems accomplishable. To ensure the clinical safety and to conform to the ethical regulations, further investigation of the infectious and immunological implications on humans should be explored prior to first clinical use. The first clinical use of cardiac xenotransplantation will be limited to only highly selected patients.
