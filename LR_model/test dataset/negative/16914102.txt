Impedance cardiography: more questions than answers. Thoracic electrical bioimpedance, also known as impedance cardiography (ICG), is a noninvasive method to obtain hemodynamic measurements, including cardiac output. Recently, there has been a flurry of reports on the clinical use of ICG. Authors have suggested that ICG measurements are useful for a myriad of situations, including diagnosis of heart failure, monitoring of a patient's clinical status, and assisting in medicine titration decisions. However, data continue to suggest poor correlation between current generation ICG devices and invasive measurements of cardiac output, especially in heart failure patients. ICG is also not able to accurately measure left ventricular filling pressures. There are limited data demonstrating any improved outcomes using ICG in the clinical setting. Given the available data, ICG use should be limited to the research setting.
