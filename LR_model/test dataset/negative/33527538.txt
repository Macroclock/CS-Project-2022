When cardiomyopathy, cancer, and COVID-19 collide: A case report. Malignancy has historically prohibited solid organ transplant; however, patients with effectively treated, favorable-risk cancers should not necessarily be eliminated as transplant candidates. These cases require careful review by a multidisciplinary team. Here, we report the case of a woman with end-stage heart failure undergoing heart transplant evaluation during the COVID pandemic who was found to have early-stage, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Given her favorable cancer-related prognosis, a multidisciplinary committee recommended lumpectomy, accelerated partial breast irradiation, and adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for definitive treatment to allow for consideration of orthotopic heart transplant.
