Genomic biomarkers and heart transplantation. Clinicians have entered into a new paradigm for managing heart transplant patients with use of multimarker gene expression profiling. Early after transplantation, when corticosteroid modification is the main concern, gene expression testing might assist in optimizing the balance of immunosuppression, defraying the occurrence of rejection, and avoiding crisis intervention. Late after transplantation, the reliance on endomyocardial biopsy could be lessened. These advances, if continually validated in practice, could usher in an era of decreased immunosuppression complications, lesser need for invasive surveillance, and more clinical confidence in immunosuppressive strategies.
