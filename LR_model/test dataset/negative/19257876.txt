[Cardiac autotransplantation in a patient with congestive heart failure]. Congestive heart failure with intact or moderately lowered left ventricular pump function is caused in some patients by mitral regurgitation. Consequences are dilation of the left atrium, pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid regurgitation, thromboembolic complications, rhythm disturbances, elevated risk of sudden death. Efficacy of drug treatment, electroimpulse therapy is little and surgery is the method of choice. One of alternatives is cardiac autotransplantation. A successful experience of application of this technique is presented. Cardiac autotransplantation was carried out in a female patient with moderately lowered left ventricular contractile function, extreme degree of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, atriomegaly, atrial fibrillation and pronounced signs of congestive heart failure.
