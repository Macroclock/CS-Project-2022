Arsenic Trioxide Combining Leflunomide Activates Nrf2-ARE-HO-1 Signaling Pathway and Protects Heart Xenografts. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of arsenic trioxide (As Transplantation of LVG hamster hearts to Lewis rats was performed by anastomosis of vessels in the neck using end-to-end anastomosis with a non-suture cuff technique. Four groups of recipient rats (n=6 in each) were treated with normal saline (control), As Expression of Nrf2-ARE-HO-1 signaling pathway was upregulated in heart xenografts in rats treated with As Combination treatment with As 'Nrf2-ARE-HO-1 signaling pathway', 'arsenic trioxide', 'infiltration', 'inflammation', 'leflunomide', 'xenotransplantation'
