Heart transplantation bridged by mechanical circulatory support in a HIV-positive patient. We report on the unique clinical course of a 44-year-old male HIV-positive heart transplant recipient, who was bridged by mechanical circulatory support (MCS). The patient was admitted with acute ischemic heart failure due to severe myocardial infarction. After emergency coronary artery bypass grafting and nine days of extracorporeal life support, we implanted a left ventricular assist device. As HIV infection was effectively treated and other contraindications were not present, we decided to perform a heart transplantation (HTX). At the current time, 34 months after unremarkable HTX, rejection or opportunistic infections have not occurred.
