Ectopic expression of Fas Ligand on cardiomyocytes renders cardiac allografts resistant to CD4(+) T-cell mediated rejection. Fas Ligand limits inflammatory injury and permits allograft survival by inducing apoptosis of Fas-bearing lymphocytes. Previous studies have shown that the CD4(+) T-cell is both sufficient and required for murine cardiac allograft rejection. Here, utilizing a transgenic mouse that over-expresses Fas Ligand specifically on cardiomyocytes as heart donors, we sought to determine if Fas Ligand on graft parenchymal cells could resist CD4(+) T-cell mediated rejection. When transplanted into fully immunocompetent BALB/c recipients Fas Ligand transgenic hearts were acutely rejected. However, when transplanted into CD4(+) T-cell reconstituted BALB/c-rag(-/-) recipients, Fas Ligand hearts demonstrated long-term survival. These results indicate that Fas Ligand over-expression on cardiomyocytes can indeed resist CD4(+) T-cell mediated cardiac rejection and suggests contact dependence between Fas Ligand expressing graft parenchymal cells and the effector CD4(+) T-cells.
