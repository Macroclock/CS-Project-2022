Successful heart-lung transplantation in a patient with kyphoscoliosis. The association is well established between congenital heart disease and spinal deformities such as scoliosis or kyphosis, but data are not available for risks and the outcome of heart surgery in patients with spinal deformities. We report a case of successful orthotopic heart lung transplantation in a patient with complex congenital heart disease and severe chest deformity who had undergone previous spinal fusion surgery for progressive right convex thoracic kyphoscoliosis.
