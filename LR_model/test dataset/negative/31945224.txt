Multimodal functional and still imaging of a transplanted human heart reanimated using Visible Heart® methodologies. Our research team obtained a human heart with the right lung attached from a recent transplantation patient via a research collaboration with LifeSource, a local organ procurement organization. The heart and lungs were not viable for transplant given the patient's medical history and were subsequently offered to the University of Minnesota for research purposes. Using Visible Heart® methodologies, we reanimated the specimen en bloc and collected multimodal direct visualization from inside the cardiac chambers and great vessels of the functioning heart. Video footage, using videoscopic and fluoroscopic imaging, was captured and is presented in this report as supporting material. Multiple still images highlight the surgical suture sites of the transplantation procedures. This multimodal imaging offers unique educational value for medical students, clinicians, and medical device designers for improving transplantation techniques and patient outcomes.
