Transplant and mechanical circulatory support in patients with adult congenital heart disease. Advances in surgery and pediatric care over the past decades have achieved improved survival for children born with congenital heart disease (CHD) and have produced a large, growing population of patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD). Heart failure has emerged as the leading cause of death and a major cause of morbidity among the ACHD population, while as little evidence supports the efficacy of guideline-directed medical therapies in this population. It is increasingly important that clinicians caring for these patients understand how to utilize mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in ACHD. In this review, we summarize the data on transplantation and MCS in the ACHD-heart failure population and provide a framework for how ACHD patients may benefit from advanced heart failure therapies like transplantation and MCS.
