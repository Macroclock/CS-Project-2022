Risk factors for smoking abuse after heart transplantation. Patients (n = 103) were studied before heart transplantation with regard to smoking habits by means of a clinical interview, and 81 were submitted to Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). After a mean time of 50.8 +/- 24.2 months from transplant, they were once again interviewed to ascertain their smoking habits after intervention. Nonsmokers (35 of 103) were still nonabusers. Of the remaining 68 patients who ceased smoking before heart transplant, 12 (17.6%) had returned to tobacco abuse. Dividing these 68 patients into two groups based upon the length of smoking cessation before heart transplant (less than 1 year: short term [ST] more than 1 year: long term [LT]), we noticed that the ST group showed a much greater rate of reabuse (8 of 20, 40%) than the LT group (4 of 48, 8.3%, P =.006). Analyzing six scales of MMPI, we found a statistically different score for self-control ability (scale K) in ST and LT smokers compared to nonsmokers (45.5 and 45.5 vs 51.2, P =.026), and for difficult adaptation (scale Ma) in ST compared both to LT smokers and nonsmokers (ST 57, LT 50.5, NS 47.6; P =.042 LT vs ST, P =.0005 ST vs NS). We concluded that patients who have recently decided to stop smoking and show after MMPI compilation a score of >50 for K and <50 for Ma scale have a higher risk of reabuse and need a greater effort by the transplant team to reinforce their will to stop smoking.
