Lipocalin-2 regulates the inflammatory response during ischemia and reperfusion of the transplanted heart. Ischemia and reperfusion (IR) are known to negatively affect early allograft function following solid organ transplantation. Lipocalin-2 (Lcn-2) has been described as a marker and potential positive modulator of acute inflammation during these processes. Using a heterotopic murine heart transplant model we previously found that IR resulted in a pronounced upregulation of Lcn-2 mRNA in the heart at 12 (22.7-fold increase) and 24 h (9.8-fold increase) of reperfusion. We now confirm this increase at the protein level and provide evidence for infiltrating polymorphonuclear cells as the primary source of Lcn-2 protein. Lcn-2 levels are increased 6.6-fold at 12 h, 11.4-fold at 24 h and 6.4 fold at 48 h after reperfusion. In Lcn-2(-/-) grafts the number of infiltrating granulocytes is reduced by 54% (p < 0.05) at 2 h, 79% (p < 0.01) at 12 h, 72% (p < 0.01) at 24 h and 52% (p < 0.01) at 48 h after reperfusion compared to Lcn-2(+/+) grafts, without any differences in cardiomyocyte apoptosis. These data suggest a function of Lcn-2 in the initiation of the inflammatory response. Moreover, an increase in Lcn-2 is not only restricted to the transplanted heart, but is also observed in the kidney, hinting at a possible involvement of Lcn-2 in the systemic response to IR.
