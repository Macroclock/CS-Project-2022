Macrophage Depletion Improves Chronic Rejection in Rats With Allograft Heart Transplantation. Macrophages may be important in chronic rejection after organ transplantation. This study aimed to investigate the possibility of depleting macrophages for a certain amount of time to alleviate chronic rejection in a heart transplant model of Fischer to Lewis rats. Clodronate liposome was injected abdominally to deplete macrophages for 2 time frames. The expression levels of ectodysplasin 1, arginase 1 (Arg1), chitinase-like lectin (Ym1), interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), smooth muscle α-actin (α-SMA), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), and interleukin 10 (IL-10) were detected. 1. The expression levels of α-SMA, interferon gamma, TNF-α, and MCP-1 and the transformation of peripheral T cells were lower after macrophage depletion for 2 or 4 weeks. 2. The expression levels of α-SMA, TNF-α, and MCP-1 and the transformation of peripheral T cells were even lower after 4 weeks compared with 2 weeks, except for interferon gamma. 3. A higher level of expression of Arg1 and Ym1 after macrophage depletion for 2 weeks was observed. 4. A higher level of expression of IL-10 after macrophage depletion for 2 weeks, but not 4 weeks, was also observed. Macrophage clearance after heart transplantation alleviated chronic rejection probably via M2 polarization of regenerated macrophages, reduced T-lymphocyte proliferation, and changed the expression levels of interferon gamma, TNF-α, MCP-1, and IL-10.
