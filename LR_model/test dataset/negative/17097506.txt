Is toxoplasmosis prophylaxis necessary in cardiac transplantation? Long-term follow-up at two transplant centers. Cardiac transplant recipients are often given prophylactic treatments to prevent opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis carinii. Toxoplasmosis prophylaxis is commonly prescribed for transplant recipients who have not been exposed to this disease but receive a heart from an exposed donor. We reviewed the collective 28-year experience at two urban transplant programs with 596 patients, and found no cases of toxoplasmosis, but all patients received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent Pneumocystis pneumonia. We conclude that specific anti-toxoplasmosis prophylaxis is unnecessary in heart transplant recipients.
