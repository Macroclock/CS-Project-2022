Ultrasound molecular imaging of acute cellular cardiac allograft rejection in rat with T-cell-specific nanobubbles. Acute rejection (AR) is one of the main obstacles of cardiac transplantation; however, a noninvasive diagnostic method, which reflects its pathologic nature, has not been developed yet. In this study, we prepared a specific nanobubbles targeting to the activated T cells and applied it in the ultrasound molecular imaging of AR in heart transplantation by myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE). Nanobubbles loading anti-CD25 antibody (NB(specific)) or isotype control antibody (NB(nonspecific)) were prepared and then applied in the ultrasound molecular imaging by MCE in a rat model. MCE was performed in 24 allografts and 18 isografts that were divided into three groups, including days 2, 4, and 6 after transplantation. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to evaluate the binding of nanobubbles and T cells in four allografts and four isografts. MCE with NB(specific) in allograft showed a "delayed enhancement," and the time-intensity curve presented a second peak. The intensity and time of second peak were both positively correlated with the transplant time (P<0.01) and the pathologic grade of AR (P<0.01). Confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated the binding of nanobubbles and lymphocytes in myocardium post-MCE with NB(specific). Ultrasound molecular imaging of AR after heart transplantation can be achieved by using MCE with the nanobubbles targeted to T cells. The appearance of delayed enhancement indicates the occurrence of AR, and the intensity and time of the second peak in time-intensity curve provide potential quantitative indications for diagnosis and severity of AR.
