Role of N-acetylcysteine on renal function in patients after orthotopic heart transplantation undergoing coronary angiography. The aim of this study was to assess nephroprotective influence of intravenous N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on renal function after radiocontrast use in calcineurin inhibitor-treated patients after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). We analyzed the results of 112 consecutive coronary angiography examinations (CAG). All patients received intravenous 500 mL multielectrolyte fluid (PWE) before catheterization. Group I of 55 randomly selected cases in addition were treated with 300 mg of NAC. The other 57 cases (group II) received only hydration. After catheterization, we administered 500 mL 0.9% saline with 20 mg furosemide. A nonionic, low-osmolality contrast agent (OPTIRAY) was used for all catheterizations. All patients underwent measurements of serum creatinine and creatinine clearance levels before and after the procedure (CREA0, CREA1, CC0, and CC1, respectively). We assessed the influence of NAC on CREA1 and the relative change of CREA1/CREA0 and CC1/CC0 ratios. In groups I and II we noticed decreased CC0 in 17 versus 22 cases (31% vs 39%), a relative change of CREA1/CREA0 ratio of 0% versus -3.95% and of CC1/CC0 ratio 0% versus 4, 11%, respectively. CIN was not recognized in any patient. None of the differences was significant. Intravenous NAC (300 mg) along with hydration before radiocontrast use had no impact on renal function in OHT patients undergoing CAG. It seems that there is no need for an additional preventive strategy apart from hydration and a small volume of low osmolar contrast in the majority of patients.
