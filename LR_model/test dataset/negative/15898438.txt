[Modified low-potassium dextran solution in heart-lung transplantation]. To determine the application of modified low-potassium dextran (LPD) solution in heart-lung transplantation. We used the modified LPD as the lung flush solution of the donor in the first heart-lung transplantation procedure in Hunan. The patient survived 555 days after the surgery and severe infection, lung disfunction or severe graft rejection never occurred. Modified LPD as lung flush solution of the donor during heart-lung transplantation demonstrates an excellent effect of lung protection.
