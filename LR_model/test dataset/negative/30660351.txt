Novel Cytokine Score and Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy. To date, there are no established noninvasive biomarkers available for prediction of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). Inflammatory processes are supposed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of CAV. Recent studies have suggested that immune mediators could serve as biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases. We hypothesized particular cytokines or a combination thereof may serve as noninvasive biomarkers for CAV. Plasma cytokines were screened from 27 patients with CAV and 27 patients without CAV after OHT. The concentrations of interleukins-4, -6, -10, -21, -23, -31, -33, interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and the soluble activation marker CD40 ligand were determined using Luminex-based multiplex analyses. Although concentrations of all cytokines except interferon gamma were on average higher in the CAV group, there were no significant differences between the groups for any 1 cytokine. Using a binary logistic regression model, we were able to develop a probability score for detecting patients at elevated risk for advanced CAV with a sensitivity of 92.31% and a specificity of 60.71% (receiver-operating characteristic area under the curve 0.799 Â± 0.06; p<0.0001). In conclusion, analyzing the concentration of specific inflammatory cytokines could be meaningfully included in evaluation of CAV after OHT.
