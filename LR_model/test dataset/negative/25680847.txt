Tolerance induced by IL-6 deficient donor heart is significantly involved in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Transplant tolerance induced by IL-6 deficient donor is supported by regulatory T cells (Tregs). However, it is unknown whether innate immunoregulatory cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are involved in the process. In this study, we demonstrate the role of MDSCs by transplanting IL-6 deficient heart grafts into wild-type recipients in a murine allogeneic transplant model. Our data further revealed that utilization of IL-6 deficient heart grafts could cause a significant prolongation of allograft survival (Mantel-Cox Test, p = 0.001; Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon Test, p = 0.0016) and a remarkable increase of the frequency of CD11b + Gr1(-low) in the recipients' spleens (p = 0.0028). MDSCs rather than Th17 cells are closely involved in induced tolerance by IL-6 deficient donor heart. This unveiled mechanism of targeting IL-6 or its signaling pathway may provide a novel insight into preventing allograft rejection for non-sensitized transplant recipients.
