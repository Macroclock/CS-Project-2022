Recombinant dimeric MHC antigens protect cardiac allografts from rejection and visualize alloreactive T cells. Monomeric and dimeric soluble major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules down-regulate activated T cells in an antigen-specific manner in vitro. This property could be exploited to modulate alloresponses in vivo but has remained difficult to demonstrate. Here, intraperitoneal infusion of a Lewis-derived rat MHC class I molecule, RT1.A(l)-Fc, in Dark Agouti (RT1.A(a)) recipient rats prolonged cardiac graft survival, which led to permanent engraftment. This effect was mediated by T cell impairment of target cell lysis by CD8+ T cells and down-regulation of interferon-gamma production by CD4+ T cells. The binding of the dimeric MHC allowed ex vivo visualization of alloreactive T cells in peripheral blood, splenocytes, and allografts, revealing low frequency of alloreactive CD8+ T cells after establishment of permanent engraftment of cardiac allografts. Thus, these data show the potential of dimeric MHC molecules to promote graft survival and allow visualization of alloreactive T cells.
