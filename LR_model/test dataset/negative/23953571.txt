Oxytocin ameliorates the immediate myocardial injury in rat heart transplant through downregulation of neutrophil-dependent myocardial apoptosis. Cardiac oxytocin (OT) is structurally identical to that found in the hypothalamus, indicating that this active form of OT is derived from the same gene. The abundance of OT and its receptors in atrial myocytes suggests that, directly and/or via the release of the cardiac hormone atrial natriuretic peptide, this hormone regulates the force of cardiac contractions. Previous studies have demonstrated a role of OT in myocardial inflammatory responses. We sought to study protective myocardial and anti-inflammatory effects of OT in the immediate post-transplant period. We grouped adult male Albino rats into sham, control, and OT-treated groups. Control and treated groups underwent heterotopic cervical heart transplantation. Myocardial injury was assessed by measuring plasma cardiac troponin I, and myocardial proinflammatory cytokines as well as by performing histopathologic assessments injury score, and of apoptotic degree. Myocardial myeloperoxidase, neutrophil infiltration, neutrophil chemotactic mediators as well as formation of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species were measured in the myocardium at 3 hours after reperfusion to assess neutrophil-dependent myocardial injury. OT downregulates neutrophil chemotactic molecules--KC/CXCL1 and MIP-2/CXCL2. The decrement in myocardial PMN infiltration was associated with reduced reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species formation in the myocardium at 3 hours after reperfusion following global ischemia. OT reduced postmyocardial ischemia/reperfusion apoptotic processed. OT ameliorated immediate myocardial injury in heart grafts, through downregulation of the inflammatory response, of reactive oxygen species, and of neutrophil dependent apoptosis.
