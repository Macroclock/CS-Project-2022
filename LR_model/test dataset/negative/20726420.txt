Combined analysis of allograft inflammatory factor-1, interleukin-18, and Toll-like receptor expression and association with allograft rejection and coronary vasculopathy. In cardiac transplantation settings, the initial myocardial ischemia and reperfusion may cause myocyte tissue injury and the release of allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1). This in part may trigger the innate immune response through the modulation of Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2) and AIF-1 expression and function, causing the release of proinflammatory cytokines. The goal was to demonstrate these markers in the peripheral blood and biopsy specimen from recipients with cardiac allograft rejection and coronary vasculopathy (CV). Peripheral blood and endomyocardial specimens were tested by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry stains for identification of TLR-2, -4, interleukin-18, and AIF-1 markers and analyzed against clinical rejection grades for rejection. The differences for mRNA transcript levels were determined by one-way analysis of variance. The mRNA expression levels were significantly varied for TLR-2 in monocytes with different rejection grades (P < 0.0001). The mean +/- SEM level of mRNA expression for 3A grade rejection was 64.21 +/- 3.8; grade 1A, 38.4 +/- 3.5; and for Grade 0 was 38.46 +/- 2.8. The TLR-4 mRNA expression was increased but the specificity was not statistically significant. The TLR-2 immunoreactivity was strongly detected in infiltrating mononuclear cells and cardiac myocytes in Grade 3A rejection. AIF-1 expression was increased significantly in the group with 3A rejection and Grade III CV as compared with Grade 0 or 1A. Interleukin-18 receptors were strongly detected in Grade 3A rejection and CV. The expression profiles of AIF-1, TLR-2, and interleukin-18 were correlated with biopsy-proven allograft rejection in both peripheral blood and local tissue, suggesting a potential for diagnostic biomarkers for early detection of allograft rejection.
