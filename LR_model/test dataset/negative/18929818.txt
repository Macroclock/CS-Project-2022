Retransplantation after single lung transplantation. Our lung transplant program started in June 1989 with primary grafts including 21 heart-lung, 11 single lung, and 5 bilateral sequential single lung transplantation. Three patients required retransplantation for single lung and 2 patients for heart-lung grafts. The primary cause of death after lung transplantation is chronic graft dysfunction--bronchiolitis obliteran--though other causes, namely acute graft failure, have been mentioned. Retransplantation is considered to be the only treatment option. In experienced centers, the 1- and 5-year survivals are not as good as for other organ transplantations and for retransplantations the outcome is even worse. Our objective herein was to describe factors to be taken into account for retransplantation in our program, including the timing and indication for retransplantation and the presence of comorbidities. In our experience of 11 single lung transplantations, 3 (27.3%) were retransplantations. The 3 patients were 3, 5, and 2 years after primary transplantation. The indications were overexpansion of the remaining lung compressing the new lung in one and bronchiolitis obliterans in the others. One patient with emphysema died in hospital after retransplantation because of acute myocardial infarction. One patient with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) disease died of lung complication after sudden cardiac arrest at 1.5 years after retransplantation. One patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is still alive at 5 years after retransplantation. Bronchiolitis obliterans was a common reason for retransplantation among our patients as well as in other reports. Bronchiolitis exists with superimposed infection for years if it is the mild form. However, the clinical setting is progressively worse if it could not be controlled leading to retransplantation. At this stage, progressive deterioration of lung function must be considered because of inadequate therapy for infection. Finally, when there is infection usually both lungs are involved. The decision whether to replace the transplanted lung or the remaining lung is a concern, especially when the donor availability is scarce. In conclusion, lung retransplantation is the only treatment option for severe graft dysfunction, if there is no other therapy that can prolong life. Though bronchiolitis obliterans often is the indication for retransplantation, bronchiolitis itself is the signal of retransplantation.
