[Establishment of modified abdominal heart transplantation model in rats]. To investigate the techniques of establishment of abdominal heart transplantation model in rats and modify the procedure to make it more stable and improve the success rate. Heterotopic abdominal heart transplantations of Wistar and SD rats were performed by using Ono's method with modification of preparation of recipients, donor cardiectomy and donor transplantations. One hundred heart transplantations were performed, among which 90 were successful. The success rate was 90%. This modified Ono's method can shorten the ischemia time and recipient abdominal aorta occlusion time, make vessel anastomosis easier and increase the success rate of operation. It is a stable and reliable model of heart transplantations in rats.
