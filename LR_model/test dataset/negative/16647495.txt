Attitudes of resident doctors toward different types of organ donation in a Spanish transplant hospital. Our aim was to analyze acceptance of cadaveric and living organ donation for transplantation among resident doctors, given that they are the new professionals of medicine who will have to encourage and develop transplant programs. A random survey was performed on resident doctors in a third-level hospital with an organ transplant program which is accredited for undergraduate and postgraduate education (n = 171). Attitudes toward cadaveric and living donation were evaluated using a questionnaire including various psychosocial variables that might affect such attitudes. We used the Student t test and the chi-square test. The sample was composed of responses by 171 resident doctors of mean age 28 +/- 4 years with 56% women. Attitudes toward cadaveric donation were favorable in 92% (n = 157). As for living donation, the percentage in favor of nonrelated donation was low: 23% for kidney and 19% for liver. However, when the donation was from a relative, the percentages increased to levels similar to those of cadaveric donation, namely 88% and 85% for kidney and liver, respectively. No differences were observed in attitudes toward cadaveric or living donation according to various psychosocial variables. The trainee doctors showed favorable attitudes toward human cadaveric organ donation as well as living related donation, which suggests a relaunch of living donors in the near future. However, there was not much acceptance of nonrelated donation, as has also been seen in studies of the general public in our geographical area.
