Can ischemic preconditioning alone really protect organs from ischemia reperfusion injury in transplantation. Organ transplantation is the only choice for treatment of end-stage disease. The ischemia reperfusion injury (I/RI) occurring after cold ischemia is an unavoidable injury during transplantation, which is also one of the main causes of graft failure. Multiple mechanisms have been postulated to explain tissue injury that occurs after I/RI. It is well-known that ischemic preconditioning (IPC), a short period of ischemia followed by reperfusion, arouses the endogenous mechanism of protection against a sustained ischemic insult. Can ischemic preconditioning alone really protect organs from ischemia reperfusion injury in transplantation?
