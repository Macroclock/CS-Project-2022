Bilirubin oxidation provoked by nitric oxide radicals predicts the progression of acute cardiac allograft rejection. Bilirubin, a strong intrinsic antioxidant, quenches free radicals produced under inflammatory conditions. The oxidized bilirubin metabolites, i.e. biopyrrins, are immediately excreted into urine and can indicate the intensity of oxidation in vivo. Our preliminary studies suggested the involvement of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in generation of biopyrrins. However, little is known about biological significance of bilirubin oxidation by RNS. Here, we analyzed the correlation between bilirubin oxidation and nitric oxide (NO) radicals during rat acute cardiac allograft rejection. In allograft recipients, urinary biopyrrins steeply increased on day 3 prior to the increase in myocardial tissue damage marker, serum troponin-T. In contrast, no significant changes in urinary biopyrrins were evident in recipients of isografts or cyclosporine-A treated allografts. Urinary nitrotyrosine, a marker of oxidation by NO radicals also increased on day 3, while administration of a NO synthase inhibitor, N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine apparently diminished the elevation of urinary biopyrrins as well as nitrotyrosine. Immunohistochemistry revealed enhanced local expression of heme oxygenase-1, biopyrrins and nitrotyrosine in allografts in accordance with the cellular infiltrates, suggesting that changes in urinary biopyrrins reflect the bilirubin oxidation in grafts undergoing rejection. These results indicate that locally evoked bilirubin oxidation by NO radicals can predict the progression of rejection.
