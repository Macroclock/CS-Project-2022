Cardiac valve operations after solid organ transplantation: A single-center experience. Cardiac valve operations in patients who have undergone solid organ transplantation (ie, kidney, liver, pancreas, heart, and lung) pose unique challenges due to patient comorbidities and to the need for immunosuppressive therapy. The aim of this retrospective study was to present our experience with patients with solid-organ transplant who had cardiac valve operation at the time or after transplantation. Records of patients who had undergone cardiac valve operations after solid organ transplantation between January 1998 and January 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Follow-up amounted to a median of 51 months (interquartile range, 5-88 months). Among the 14,465 patients who underwent treatment for a cardiac valvular pathology during the study period, 127 patients (0.9%) had undergone a solid organ transplantation (kidney: n = 9 [76%]; liver: n = 12 [9%]; pancreas: n = 4 [3%]; heart: n = 16 [13%]; lung: n = 9 [7%]). Postoperatively, 14 patients (11%) underwent rethoracotomy for bleeding and 24 patients (19%) required new dialysis treatment. Twenty-five patients (20%) died in-hospital. Postoperative course was worse in patients operated for endocarditis or undergoing concomitant transplantation and valve surgery. Overall survival was 59%, 47%, and 40%, but survival conditioned to hospital discharge was 73%, 58%, and 50% at 5-, 10-, and 15-year follow-up, respectively. Freedom from major valve-related events amounted to 77%, 56%, and 46%, respectively. Although the high prevalence of postoperative complications, especially in patients with endocarditis or concomitant transplantation and valve surgery, survival conditioned to hospital discharge was satisfactory in patients undergoing valve surgery after solid organ transplantation.
