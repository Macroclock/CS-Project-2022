Usefulness of Two-Dimensional Strain Parameters to Diagnose Acute Rejection after Heart Transplantation. Acute cellular rejection (ACR) is still a relevant complication after orthotopic heart transplantation. The diagnosis of ACR is based on endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). Recent advances in two-dimensional strain imaging may allow early noninvasive detection of ACR. The objective of this study was to analyze the usefulness of conventional and new echocardiographic parameters to exclude ACR after orthotopic heart transplantation. Thirty-four consecutive adult heart transplant recipients admitted to a single center between January 2010 and December 2012 for orthotopic heart transplantation were prospectively included. A total of 235 pairs of EMB and echocardiographic examination were performed. A median of seven studies per patient (interquartile range, six to eight studies per patient) were performed during the first year of follow-up. Classic echocardiographic parameters; speckle-tracking-derived left ventricular (LV) longitudinal, radial, and circumferential strain; and global and free wall right ventricular (RV) longitudinal strain were analyzed. ACR was detected in 26.4% of EMB samples (n = 62); 5.1% (n = 12) required specific treatment (ACR degree ≥ 2R). Lower absolute values of global LV longitudinal strain and free wall RV longitudinal strain were present in patients with ACR degree ≥ 2R compared with those without ACR (13.7 ± 2.7% vs 17.8 ± 3.4% and 16.6 ± 3.6% vs 23.3 ± 5.2%, respectively). An average LV longitudinal strain < 15.5% had 85.7% sensitivity, 81.4% specificity, 98.8% negative predictive value, 25.0% positive predictive value, and 81.7% accuracy for the presence of ACR degree ≥ 2R. Free wall RV longitudinal strain < 17% had 85.7% sensitivity, 91.1% specificity, 98.8% negative predictive value, 42.9% positive predictive value, and 90.7% accuracy for ACR degree ≥ 2R. Both variables were normal in 106 echocardiograms (57.6%); none of these patients presented with ACR degree ≥ 2R. The combination of two new echocardiographic measures, global LV and RV free wall longitudinal strain, may be able to identify a group of heart transplant patients who are unlikely to have ACR. If these findings are confirmed independently, it may be possible to use LV and RV strain measures as reliable tools to exclude ACR and to reduce the burden of repeated EMB.
