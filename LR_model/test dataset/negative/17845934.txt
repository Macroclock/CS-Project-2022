Epstein-Barr virus-associated multifocal leiomyosarcomas arising in a cardiac transplant recipient: autopsy case report and review of the literature. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated smooth muscle tumors (SMTs) have been described in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and, more recently, in association with immunosuppression after solid-organ transplantation. We present the autopsy findings of multiple leiomyosarcomas (LMSs) in a 24-year old man who died 18 months after undergoing orthotopic cardiac transplantation for idiopathic cardiomyopathy. The recognition of EBV-driven LMS developing in cardiac transplant recipients in multiple unusual sites is crucial for the management of these patients and should include complete surgical removal anti-viral therapy and modulation of immunosuppression.
