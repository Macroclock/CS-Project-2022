Sirolimus in de novo heart transplant recipients with severe renal impairment. Two patients with end-stage heart failure and advanced renal dysfunction (under chronic dialysis therapy) underwent heart transplantation. In order to avoid further renal impairment, a calcineurine inhibitor-free immunosuppression regimen based on the sirolimus was used. Although temporary perioperative support with hemofiltration and dialysis was needed, both patients eventually regained a reasonable renal function with no episodes of clinical rejection and normal cardiac function at 13 and 11 months, respectively, after transplantation. Sirolimus-based immunosuppression might be an interesting alternative to calcineurine inhibitors in the management of patients with significant renal impairment.
