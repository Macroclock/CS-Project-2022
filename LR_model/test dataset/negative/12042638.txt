Analysis of transforming growth factor-beta and profibrogenic molecules in a rat cardiac allograft model treated with cyclosporine. Long-term treatment of heart transplantation recipients with cyclosporine (CsA) results in chronic nephrotoxic effects, which frequently lead to progressive renal failure. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and other fibrogenic molecules are leading candidates for these effects, because CsA is known to induce TGF-beta. In this study we compared the expression of TGF-beta, collagen, fibronectin, metalloproteinases, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases in kidneys from recipients of heterotopic heart transplants treated with CsA for 30 and 180 days. Using a clinically relevant experimental rodent model (strain combination Wistar Furth [RT1u] into Lewis [RT1l]), heterotopic heart transplantation was performed, creating disparate cardiac allografts. The transplant study population was divided into three groups: controls and those receiving CsA immunosuppression therapy to maintain graft survival for 30-day and 180-day periods. Comparisons were made of intrarenal expression of TGF-beta, collagen, fibronectin, metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, and tissue inhibitor of MMP-2, using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Intrarenal expression of TGF-beta protein was also compared using immunochemical staining technique, and circulating levels of TGF-beta protein were quantified by ELISA. Intrarenal expression of TGF-beta, collagen, fibronectin, MMP-2, MMP-9, and tissue inhibitor of MMP-2 was significantly increased in rats treated with CsA for 180 days compared with untreated rats and those treated for 30 days. Circulating levels and intrarenal expression of TGF-beta were also significantly increased in rats treated for 180 days. Posttransplantation nephrotoxicity in cardiac transplant recipients treated with CsA for a long term is related to increased expression of TGF-beta and other fibrogenic genes. Therapies designed to inhibit expression of TGF-beta could ameliorate CsA-associated nephrotoxicity in cardiac transplant recipients.
