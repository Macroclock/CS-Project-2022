Late-onset chylothorax after heart-lung transplantation. Chylothorax has rarely been reported after heart and lung transplantation. We describe a case of a bilateral chylothorax that occurred in a 53-year-old man 4 months after heart-lung transplantation and review the three additional reports in the literature of chylothorax after heart transplantation. Chyle drainage may cause compromise of the transplant patient. The good nutritional status of our recipient, however, allowed conservative therapy with chest tube drainage and enteral low-fat diet, without the need for surgical intervention. We concluded that chylothorax can presents late after lung transplantation and that conservative treatment should be considered in patients with good nutritional status.
