Fulminant myocarditis. Myocarditis is most often caused by a viral infection. Less common causes include other infectious agents and autoimmune diseases. Fulminant myocarditis is an unusual complication with a rapidly progressive course resulting in severe heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Fulminant myocarditis should be treated with full supportive care, using aggressive pharmacologic therapy and mechanical circulatory support, because significant improvement in left ventricular function will often occur. Cardiac transplantation is required in a small minority of patients. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is becoming a frequently used modality to aid in the diagnosis of myocarditis.
