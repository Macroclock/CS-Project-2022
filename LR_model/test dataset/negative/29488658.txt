Protective action of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in immune tolerance of allogeneic heart transplantation by regulating CD45RB Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) could exert a potent immunosuppressive effect and therefore may have a therapeutic potential in T-cell-dependent pathologies. We aimed to examine the effects of BMSCs on immune tolerance of allogeneic heart transplantation and the involvement of CD45RB Bone marrow-derived DCs and BMSCs were co-cultured, with CD45RB expression on the surface of DCs measured by flow cytometry. qRT-PCR and Western blotting were used to detect mRNA and protein levels. Cytometric bead array was performed to determine the serum level of IL-10. Survival time of transplanted heart and expression of CD4 DCs co-cultured with BMSCs showed increased CD45RB and Foxp3 levels. CD45RB BMSCs increased the expression of CD45RB in the bone marrow-derived DCs, thereby strengthening immunosuppression capacity of T cells and immune tolerance of allogeneic heart transplantation.
