Outcome of treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in heart transplant recipients with chronic hepatitis C. The combination of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) is the current treatment for chronic hepatitis C (CHC). The treatment is thought to suppress viral replication and induce viral clearance via immunomodulatory effects. For this reason, concern exists for the use of this treatment in recipients of a solid organ transplantation. We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PEG-IFN/RBV in heart transplant recipients with CHC. From June 2005 to September 2009, we treated three CHC patients with heart transplantation. PEG-IFN alpha2b and RBV doses and treatment duration were set according to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype and body weight as per current recommendations. Dose reductions were dictated by individual patient tolerability. Cardiac safety was monitored by clinical examinations, echocardiography, and measurement of troponin I and B-type natriuretic peptide, as well as endomyocardial biopsies. All three patients, displayed HCV genotype 1b infection, viral loads of >5 logs, and a Scheuer fibrosis score â‰¥ 2. Two of them completed the prescribed treatment course becoming sustained virological responders. The other patient had an initial complete virological response, but subsequently experienced a viral breakthrough after reduction of PEG-IFN and withdrawal of RBV due to severe anemia. We observed no cardiovascular adverse events nor rejection episodes. Posttreatment clinical history and examination, electrocardiography, and echocardiography did not show any sign of graft dysfunction. Treatment with PEG-IFN/RBV may be safely offered to stable heart transplant recipients with CHC and signs of liver disease progression. Close monitoring of treatment safety is mandatory.
