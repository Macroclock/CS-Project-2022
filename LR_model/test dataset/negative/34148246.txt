Acute right ventricular failure in a patient with nonischemic cardiogenic shock on left-sided mechanical circulatory support. We report a case of acute right ventricular failure in a patient with cardiogenic shock on left-sided mechanical circulatory support with Impella 5.0. The patient was successfully bridged to heart transplantation using additional right-sided support with Protek Duo. Key learning points of the case include prompt recognition of acute right ventricular failure in patients on left-sided support, early consideration of right-ventricular mechanical support platforms, and timely deployment of right-sided mechanical support.
