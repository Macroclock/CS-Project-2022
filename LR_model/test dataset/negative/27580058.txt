Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Valganciclovir in Pediatric Heart Transplant Recipients 4 Months of Age and Younger. Valganciclovir (VGCV) effectively prevents cytomegalovirus disease in adult and pediatric solid organ transplant recipients. A dosing algorithm for VGCV for pediatric patients, based on body surface area and renal function, provides a personalized dose using age-appropriate formulations. The suitability of this dosing algorithm has not been assessed specifically in infants and neonates 4 months of age and younger receiving a solid organ transplant. This multicenter prospective study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of VGCV oral solution in 17 heart transplant recipients 4 months of age and younger who received 2 doses of VGCV on consecutive days using the pediatric dosing algorithm. Plasma concentrations of ganciclovir (GCV) were analyzed at specified times up to 24 hours post VGCV administration. GCV concentration data were available from 16 patients. The combined data from this study and historic study datasets were used to establish a 2-compartment population PK model with first-order formation to describe the PK of GCV after oral VGCV administration in patients across all pediatric age ranges, including those younger than 4 months of age. Estimated mean area under the curve during the 0-24 hours dosing interval for these patients was 68.1 μg·h/mL. The pediatric dosing algorithm for VGCV (utilizing individuals' body surface area and renal function) provides systemic GCV exposures in patients younger than 4 months that are similar to those observed in older pediatric populations. The data indicate that this dosing algorithm is appropriate across the entire pediatric age range, including this youngest age group.
