Heterogeneous outcomes of liver disease after heart transplantation for a failed Fontan procedure. Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD) uniformly affects patients with long-term Fontan physiology. The effect of isolated heart transplant (HT) on the course of FALD post-HT is not well understood. We evaluated serial liver imaging pre- and post-HT to assess liver changes over time in a single-center retrospective analysis of Fontan HT recipients who had pre- and ≥1-year post-HT liver imaging. Available patient demographic and clinical data were reviewed, including available liver biopsy results. Serial liver imaging was available in 19 patients with a median age at HT of 12 years (range 3-23), the median age from Fontan to HT of 5.7 years (range 0.8-16), and the median time from imaging to follow up of 27 months (range 12-136 months). Pre-HT liver imaging was classified as follows: normal (n=1), congested (n=9), fibrotic (n=7), and cirrhotic (n=2). The majority of transplanted patients (15/19) had improvement in their post-HT liver imaging, including 13 patients with initially abnormal imaging pre-HT having normal liver imaging at follow-up. One patient had persistent cirrhosis at 26-month follow-up, one patient had unchanged fibrosis at 18-month follow-up, and one patient progressed from fibrosis pre-HT to cirrhosis post-HT at 136 months. No patients had overt isolated liver failure during pre- or post-HT follow-up. Liver biopsy did not consistently correlate with imaging findings. Post-HT liver imaging evaluation in Fontan patients reveals heterogeneous liver outcomes. These results not only provide evidence for the improvement of FALD post-HT but also show the need for serial liver imaging follow-up post-HT.
