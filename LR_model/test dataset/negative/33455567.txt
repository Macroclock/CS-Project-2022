Effects of Donor Age and Ischemia Time on Outcome After Heart Transplant: A 10-Year Single-Center Experience. In heart failure patients, heart transplant still remains the gold standard of care. Controversy prevails whether organs from older donors or with expected prolonged ischemia times may be accepted for transplant. Between 2010 and 2020, a total of 149 patients underwent heart transplant at our department. In a retrospective analysis, 4 different groups were defined according to donor age and total ischemia time. The younger group with short ischemia time consisted of 62 donors age < 50 years and total ischemia time < 240 minutes; the younger group with long ischemia time consisted of 32 donors age < 50 years and total ischemia time ≥ 240 minutes; the older group with short ischemia time consisted of 43 donors age ≥ 50 years and total ischemia time < 240 minutes; and the older group with long ischemia time consisted of 12 donors age ≥ 50 years and total ischemia time ≥ 240 minutes. Prolonged total ischemia time increased the risk of primary graft dysfunction (P = .02) and perioperative neurological events (P = .04). In contrast, there were no differences regarding durations of intensive care unit stay and hospital stay, perioperative bleeding, and renal failure. Although the younger donor age group showed excellent short-term survival (30-day survival rates of 97% for the younger group with short ischemia time and 91% for the younger group with long ischemia time), short-term and mid-term survival rates were impaired in patients with prolonged total ischemia time and older donor age (P = .02). Our results indicate that, in younger donors, prolonged ischemia times may be acceptable. However, in donors older than 50 years, the decision for acceptance as a donor should be made with great caution if the presumed ischemia time exceeds 4 hours.
