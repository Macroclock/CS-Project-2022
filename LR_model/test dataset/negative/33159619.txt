Autologous skeletal myoblast sheet implantation for pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy: A case report. In children with dilated cardiomyopathy, heart transplantation is the last treatment option. However, new regenerative treatments, such as cell therapy, have attracted scientific attention. We have previously demonstrated the efficacy of autologous skeletal myoblast sheet implantation for treatment of ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy in adults. Because of the mechanism underlying this cell therapy, a similar effectiveness is expected for patients with pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy. Herein, we describe the case of a child with dilated cardiomyopathy who underwent an autologous skeletal myoblast sheet implantation, which proved to be safe, and led to sustained maintenance and improvements in cardiac function and clinical status.
