Effect of immunosuppressive therapy on the serum fatty acids of phospholipids fraction in patients after heart transplantation. The effects of tacrolimus (Tac) and cyclosporine (CsA) on lipid profile is well known; however, little is known about the changes in fatty acids (FA) of phosholipids fraction (PL) in heart transplant patients after treatment with these immunosuppressants. This study aimed to investigate the effect of Tac and CsA on serum FA of PL in heart transplant patients. The study included 23 patients after heart transplantation on Tac (n = 14; group II) or CsA (n = 9; group I). Eleven healthy persons served as a control group. Serum FA of PL were extracted, separated on Sep-Pak NH2, methylated, and measured with the use of gas chromatography. Chemstation software was used to analyze the data. No differences between the studied groups and control were noted for saturated FA, monounsaturated FA, polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), total FA, and PUFA n-6. The mean value of PUFA n-3 was significantly higher in the CsA group compared with the Tac group (P < .015) and control (P < .002) as well as in the Tac group compared with control (P < .001). For individual FA, higher mean concentration, compared with control, was found for C24, C20:2, C20:4, and C22:6 (P < .001 in all cases) and lower for C18:2cis (P < .001 in both groups) and for C18:3 in the Tac group. The mean values of PUFA n-6 to PUFA n-3 ratios were lower than in control (both P < .001). Different pattern of FA of PL may indicate the different FA metabolism in heart transplant patients treated by different immunosuppressants. This should be taken into account when FA supplementation in these patients is considered.
