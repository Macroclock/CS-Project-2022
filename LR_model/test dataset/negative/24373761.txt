Allosensitization in heart transplantation: an overview. Transplant candidates might manifest circulating antibodies against human leukocyte antigens and nonhuman leukocyte antigens, a condition termed allosensitization. The presence of these antibodies decreases a given candidate's possible donor pool, thereby prolonging the time to transplantation. They are also associated with poorer posttransplant outcomes including increased morbidity and mortality. With the increasing use of ventricular assist devices as a bridge to transplantation, the prevalence of allosensitized transplant candidates has increased. This has implications for transplant programs in terms of donor-recipient matching and managing transplant-related complications, which are more common in this high risk cohort. Controversy exists as to the best approach in managing sensitized patients, before and after transplantation. Transplant centres have used various strategies to reduce antibody loads with mixed results being reported; moreover, it remains unclear as to whether attempts at desensitization translate into better posttransplant outcomes. As an alternative management approach, some centres participate in large organ sharing strategies and allocate organs based on the probability of finding a successful donor-recipient match. In this article, the immunological basis of allosensitization, its causes, implications, and therapeutic strategies to manage sensitized patients are reviewed. The literature in relation to desensitization therapies in heart transplant candidates is also reviewed.
