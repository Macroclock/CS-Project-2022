Outcomes of total hip and knee arthroplasty after cardiac transplantation. The outcomes of 18 primary or revision total hip (THA) and knee arthroplasties (TKA) in 9 patients with cardiac transplants were reviewed. Primary total joint arthroplasties were performed for osteonecrosis (5 hips) or osteoarthritis (5 hips, 4 knees). There were no infections in any of these patients. Final Harris Hip Scores were 71.8 for patients with osteonecrosis and 88.6 for osteoarthritis. Eight of 10 hips were pain-free at final follow-up. Two of the 10 primary THAs required late revision at 7 and 10 years after the index arthroplasty. One patient (2 hips and 1 knee) had chronic bilateral lower extremity pain. Total knee arthroplasty range of motion averaged from 7.5° to 118°. Average final Knee Society function score was 79, and objective score was 88. One of 4 patients with primary TKA required a manipulation under anesthesia. No reoperations were required in this group. Overall, patients with heart transplantations on immunosuppression had generally good pain relief after THA and TKA. There were no infections in this small cohort; however, there were many complications.
