The immune effect of intrathymic inoculation and whole body irradiation on production of xenoantibody in a pig-to-monkey heart transplantation model. This study was designed to investigate the immune effect of intrathymic inoculation and whole body irradiation on the production of monkey anti-pig xenoantibodies in a pig-to-monkey model. Donor (Meishan pig) and recipient (Rhesus monkey) animals were divided randomly into three groups: 1) the control group (group A), 2) the whole body irradiation (WBI) group (group B), and 3) the irradiation and intrathymic inoculation group (group C). The change in the percentage of antibody-positive (IgM and IgG) cells after pretreatment and xenografting were detected by flow cytometry. After WBI, the level of natural IgM antibody decreased significantly (p<0.01), but the level of natural IgG antibody did not change (p>0.05). After xenografting, the levels of elicited xenoreactive IgM and IgG antibodies (EXA) in group C rose slower than in groups A and B (p<0.01). Irradiation and intrathymic inoculation dampened the production of elicited xenoreactive IgM and IgG antibodies in a pig-to-monkey model.
