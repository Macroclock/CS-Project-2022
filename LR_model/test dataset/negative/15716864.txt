Sarcoidosis and immunoglobulin lambda II light-chain amyloidosis diagnosed after orthotopic heart transplantation: a case report and review of the literature. Cardiac involvement by sarcoidosis and concomitant deposition of AL amyloid is an uncommon association. We describe the case of a 53-year-old African-American man with a 7-year history of dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy and severe cardiac failure who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation. His prior cardiac biopsies had only mild myocyte hypertrophy and minimal interstitial fibrosis. After surgery, numerous sarcoid granulomas and amyloid deposition were identified in the native heart. Six days after the transplant the patient died due to aspiration bronchopneumonia and acute renal failure. At autopsy, both sarcoidosis and immunoglobulin (Ig) lambda light-chain amyloidosis were present in the native atria, lungs, thyroid, liver, spleen, and kidneys. Sarcoid granulomas alone were present in the parathyroids, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. Amyloid deposition alone was present in the aorta, stomach, large bowel, and urinary bladder. There was no evidence of plasma cell dyscrasia, or underlying gammopathy. This unusual association was described in only two other cases in the medical literature. However, this is the first case of sarcoidosis and AL amyloidosis with successful sequencing and identification of Ig lambda light-chain amyloid, and in which there was no evidence of plasma cell dyscrasia.
