Postoperative Outcomes of the Largest HeartMate-II Experience in Turkey. HeartMate II (HMII; Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, Calif, United States) is a continuous-flow pump approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for bridge-to-transplantation (BTT) since 2008 and for destination therapy (DT) since 2010. Herein, we present the postoperative outcomes of HMII implantation due to end-stage heart failure in our center. Twenty-eight patients (mean age, 51.2 Â± 8.7 years; 1 female) were implanted with the HMII between August 2012 and August 2014. Indications were dilated (n = 18) and ischemic (n = 10) cardiomyopathy. The intended treatment was BTT in 24 and DT in 4 patients. Preoperative clinical status was International Registry for Mechanical Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) 2, 3, and 4 in 6, 14, and 8 patients, respectively. The procedure was performed via conventional sternotomy under cardiopulmonary bypass. Heparin, acetylsalicylic acid, and warfarin were used for postoperative anticoagulation. Mean duration of support was 326 days (median, 272). Three patients underwent heart transplantation and 22 remain on pump support. One patient died before discharge due to respiratory failure and 2 others died following a cerebral bleeding 248 and 265 days postoperatively, respectively. The survival rates at 6 and 12 months were 96% and 90%, respectively. Temporary right ventricular failure was observed in 2 patients. Two patients had pump thrombosis treated with anticoagulation management or pump exchange, whereas another patient who had aortic root thrombosis underwent reoperation for removal of the thrombus. Mechanical circulatory support with HMII axial flow pump seems to be effective and may provide good survival rates compared with optimum medical management and old-generation devices. Patient selection and timing of implantation are crucial for success.
