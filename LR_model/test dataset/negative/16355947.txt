Update for nurse anesthetists--anesthetic considerations for patients with amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a rare disease process that results in the deposition of insoluble, fibrous amyloid proteins in extracellular spaces and tissues. Amyloid fibrils can be deposited locally or may involve every organ system of the body. Advancements in the treatment for amyloidosis allow longer survival, and patients are being seen in our operating rooms for diagnostic, interventional, and curative purposes. Amyloidosis has numerous implications for anesthesia providers due to the possibility of systemic involvement. This course describes 2 cases of amyloidosis and discusses the types of amyloidosis and their anesthetic implications.
