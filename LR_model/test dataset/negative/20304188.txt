Recovery of renal function in heart transplantation patients after conversion from a calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy to sirolimus. Renal failure is the most important comorbidity in patients with heart transplantation, it is associated with increased mortality. The major cause of renal dysfunction is the toxic effects of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI). Sirolimus, a proliferation signal inhibitor, is an imunossupressant recently introduced in cardiac transplantation. Its nonnephrotoxic properties make it an attractive immunosuppressive agent for patients with renal dysfunction. In this study, we evaluated the improvement in renal function after switching the CNI to sirolimus among patients with new-onset kidney dysfunction after heart transplantation. The study included orthotopic cardiac transplant (OHT) patients who required discontinuation of CNI due to worsening renal function (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min). We excluded subjects who had another indication for initiation of sirolimus, that is, rejection, malignancy, or allograft vasculopathy. The patients were followed for 6 months. The creatinine clearance (CrCl) was estimated according to the Cockcroft-Gault equation using the baseline weight and the serum creatinine at the time of introduction of sirolimus and 6 months there after. Nine patients were included, 7 (78%) were males and the overall mean age was 60.1 +/- 12.3 years and time since transplantation 8.7 +/- 6.1 years. The allograft was beyond 1 year in all patients. There was a significant improvement in the serum creatinine (2.98 +/- 0.9 to 1.69 +/- 0.5 mg/dL, P = .01) and CrCl (24.9 +/- 6.5 to 45.7 +/- 17.2 mL/min, P = .005) at 6 months follow-up. The replacement of CNI by sirolimus for imunosuppressive therapy for patients with renal failure after OHT was associated with a significant improvement in renal function after 6 months.
