Incidental extraction of a temporary epicardial pacemaker wire with right ventricular perforation during endomyocardial biopsy: a case report. Right ventricular perforation during endomyocardial biopsy is an unusual, although potentially life-threatening, complication caused with the tip of the bioptome. The majority of perforations in heart transplant patients can be managed without surgery owing to adhesions nearly obliterating pericardial space. We report a case of heart transplant patient who suffered right ventricular perforation as a consequence of incidental extraction of a temporary epicardial pacemaker wire during a routine endomyocardial biopsy sampling. The patient suffered no clinical consequences.
