Brain-type natriuretic peptide correlates with right heart pressures in a cross section of pediatric heart transplant patients. Serum brain-type natriuretic peptide level (BNP) correlates with hemodynamic parameters measured during cardiac catheterization in adult patients with heart failure. We sought to describe the relationship of BNP with invasive hemodynamic measurements and cellular rejection in children following OHT. Children undergoing catheterization for OHT surveillance had simultaneous measurement of BNP. A total of 62 subjects were studied. The median BNP was 171 pg/mL (range 19-1130). There were significant positive correlations between BNP and mean PAP (R=0.33, p=0.009), RVSP (R=0.25, p=0.05), RVEDP (R=0.29, p=0.02), and mean RAP (R=0.39, p=0.002). Rejection grade varied from 0 to 3A (58 patients < ISHLT 3A and four patients â‰¥ ISHLT 3A). There was no significant difference in BNP based on cellular rejection grade. In a cohort of pediatric patients after heart transplantation, BNP correlates with direct measurements of right-sided pressures, but not with other hemodynamic measurements, time from transplant or rejection grade. This suggests that BNP may have a complimentary role in the monitoring of children following heart transplantation.
