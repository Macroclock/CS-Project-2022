[Heart and heart-lung transplants thorax complications: major radiologic forms]. Bipulmonary and cardiopulmonary transplantations are among the most difficult to perform, with a 10-year survival rate estimated at 33%. This low rate can be attributed to thoracic complications that can be classified into three distinct groups: 1) early complications, occurring in the first 30 days after transplantation (hemothorax, diaphragmatic paralysis, reperfusion edema, hydric overloading, acute rejection); 2) late complications that occur beyond the first month (bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, bronchic stenosis, sirolimus-induced lung disorders, initial disease recurrence); and 3) infections classed separately because of their high morbidity and mortality (thoracic wall abscess, bacterial and viral pneumonia, CMV, pneumocystosis, Aspergillus necrotizing bronchitis). Imaging is essential in screening and diagnosing these complications as part of the clinician's monitoring throughout the rest of the transplant recipient's life. In diagnosis, combined with clinical and biological data, imaging has its place in delaying the onset of these diseases.
