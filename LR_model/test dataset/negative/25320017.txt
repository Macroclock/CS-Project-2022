Seventeen-month-long paracorporeal biventricular mechanical support as a bridge to transplantation for severe dilated cardiomyopathy. The long-term management of paracorporeal biventricular assist devices (BiVAD) is difficult because of significant risks of bleeding, thrombosis, and infection. Here we report the case of a 41-year-old woman with severe dilated cardiomyopathy who developed serious cerebral bleeding after receiving a paracorporeal BiVAD but recovered well after treatment. She eventually underwent cardiac transplantation 17 months after implantation of the paracorporeal BiVAD.
