Hypogammaglobulinemia and infection risk in solid organ transplant recipients. Hypogammaglobulinemia may develop as a result of a number of immune deficiency syndromes that can be devastating. This review article explores the risk of infection associated with hypogammaglobulinemia in solid organ transplantation and discusses therapeutic strategies to alleviate such a risk. Hypogammaglobulinemia is associated with increased risk of opportunistic infections, particularly during the 6-month posttransplant period when viral infections are most prevalent. The preemptive use of immunoglobulin replacement results in a significant reduction of opportunistic infections in patients with moderate and severe hypogammaglobulinemia. Monitoring immunoglobulin G levels may aid in clinical management of solid organ transplant recipients. The preemptive use of immunoglobulin replacement may serve as a new strategy for managing solid organ transplant recipients with hypogammaglobulinemia.
