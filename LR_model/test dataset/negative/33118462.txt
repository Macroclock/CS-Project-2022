A successful case of heart transplantation concurrent with pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. Pre-transplant irreversible pulmonary hypertension and high pulmonary vascular resistance are generally considered as contraindications for orthotopic heart transplantation due to the high risk of right ventricular dysfunction after transplantation. However, there is no consensus on whether reversible pulmonary hypertension increases the incidence of post-transplant complications and mortality. A patient with acute heart failure and pulmonary artery occlusion successfully underwent heart transplantation concurrent with pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. This case illustrates that heart transplantation concurrent with pulmonary thromboendarterectomy can be performed successfully with meticulous operability assessment, superb surgical technique and careful perioperative management.
