Role of ventricular assist devices in the German heart allocation system. The Eurotransplant (ET) allocation algorithm, newly implemented in 2000, gives priority for heart transplantation (HTx) to patients with high urgency (HU) status, but now this status is rescinded upon ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation and only regained if severe complications occur during mechanical circulatory support (MCS). We studied the effects of this change on the patients in our institute who were waiting for HTx with MCS. The median duration of MCS until HTx in adult patients gradually increased from 3.1 months in 1994, reaching a peak of 16.7 months in 2000, and then gradually decreased to 6.0 months in 2003. Among the patients with VAD implantation as a bridge to HTx, two patients were on MCS for more than 1 year (the longest duration of MCS being 1.6 years) at the end of 1999, and this figure increased to nine patients and a maximum MCS duration of 3.7 years at the end of 2003. These data imply that the patients in whom a complication occurred in the early phase of MCS and who had overcome this complication underwent HTx early with HU status, and those who were stable during MCS waited a long time for HTx. Furthermore, the number of patients in the latter group is increasing. The new allocation algorithm imposes on patients with MCS waiting for HTx who are relatively young and free from complications and serious coexisting disease, very long-term MCS without an end to VAD bridging, which is almost equivalent to destination therapy.
