Renal Complications Following Lung Transplantation and Heart Transplantation. Renal complications are common following heart and/or lung transplantation and lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Renal dysfunction is also associated with increased mortality for patients on the transplant wait list. Dialysis dependence is a relative contraindication for heart or lung transplantation at most centers, and such patients are often listed for a simultaneous kidney transplant. Several factors contribute to the impaired renal function in patients undergoing heart and/or lung transplantation, including the interplay between cardiopulmonary and renal hemodynamics, complex perioperative issues, and exposure to nephrotoxic medications, mainly calcineurin inhibitors.
