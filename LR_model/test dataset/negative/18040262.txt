Mycobacterium haemophilum: a rare cause of endophthalmitis. Nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections are becoming an increasingly important complication in ophthalmology, particularly among immunocompromised patients. We report a case of NTM in a 66-year-old male immunosuppressed after cardiac transplantation. Chronic granulomatous iridocyclitis progressed to purulent endophthalmitis despite intraocular and systemic antimicrobial therapy. Direct immunoflourescent staining of the vitrectomy specimen revealed acid-fast bacilli. Biopsies of nodular skin lesions revealed non-caseating granulomas with acid-fast bacilli. Cultures of skin and eye biopsies yielded Mycobacterium haemophilum. Despite aggressive combination antimicrobial therapy, the eye was eventually enucleated. Resolution of systemic infection occurred with the addition of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor. This is the first reported case of M. haemophilum endophthalmitis.
