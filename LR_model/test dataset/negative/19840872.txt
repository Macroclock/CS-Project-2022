Effect of the inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor BMS-566419 on rat cardiac allograft rejection. Inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibition is a critical target in solid organ transplantation, and the development of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) represents a major advance in transplant medicine. In this study, the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological effects of BMS-566419, a novel chemically synthesized IMPDH inhibitor, were compared to those of mycophenolic acid (MPA) and MMF based on results from several immunological experiments. The in vitro inhibitory activity of BMS-566419 on IMPDH type I/II, immune cell proliferation and antibody production from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated B cells was similar, albeit slightly less potent than that of MPA. In a rat heterotopic cardiac transplant model, monotherapy using orally administered BMS-566419 60mg/kg or MMF 40mg/kg prolonged the median survival time (MST) of transplanted grafts in the vehicle group from 5 to 18 and 18.5 days, respectively. In the presence of a sub-therapeutic dose of FK506, BMS-566419 30mg/kg and MMF 20mg/kg showed identical efficacy with an MST of 21.5 days. In dinitrophenol-LPS-stimulated rats in which calcineurin inhibitors failed to inhibit antibody production, in vivo oral administration of BMS-566419 resulted in antibody production suppression with similar efficacy to MMF. The in vivo antibody production against alloantigen was also suppressed by MMF or BMS-566419 treatment. In addition, gastrointestinal toxicity, considered a dose-limiting factor of MMF, was reduced in BMS-566419 treatment. These results suggest that BMS-566419 and other chemically synthesized IMPDH inhibitors have beneficial pharmacological effects similar to those of MMF, and are potential pharmaceutical candidates in transplant indications.
