Split-graft technique in neonatal heart transplant for aortic atresia. We describe a neonate with aortic atresia and hypoplastic aorta, listed for heart transplant after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation resuscitation and ductal stenting. The donor aorta was detached from the graft, after an isolated arch reconstruction prior to the transplant itself in a routine fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of neonatal arch reconstruction before transplantation performed with grafts from the same donor in a split-way strategy.
