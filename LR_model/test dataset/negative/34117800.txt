Heart transplantation from controlled donation after circulatory death using thoracoabdominal normothermic regional perfusion and cold storage. Heart transplantation from controlled donation after the circulatory determination of death (cDCDD) may be an option to increase the pool of grafts for transplantation. Initial experiences on cDCDD heart transplantation were based on the direct procurement of the heart followed by preservation with ex situ perfusion devices. Later, the use of thoracoabdominal normothermic regional perfusion (TA-NRP) has emerged as an option to recover hearts. We present a case of a heart transplant using a graft from controlled donation after circulatory death. Cardiac preservation was performed by postmortem TA-NRP followed by cold storage. Ex situ perfusion device was not used. This is one of the first published cases of a controlled donation after circulatory death heart retrieved using only TA-NRP and successfully transplanted.
