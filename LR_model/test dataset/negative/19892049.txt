Comparison of dual source computed tomography versus intravascular ultrasound for evaluation of coronary arteries at least one year after cardiac transplantation. This study evaluated the ability of dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) to detect coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) in heart transplant recipients using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) as the standard of reference. Thirty patients with heart transplants (81% men, mean age 40 years) underwent DSCT (330-ms gantry rotation, 2 x 64 x 0.6-mm collimation, 60- to 80-ml contrast agent, no additional beta blockers) before invasive coronary angiography including IVUS of 1 vessel. Detection of CAV by DSCT was qualitatively defined as the presence of any coronary plaque. Mean heart rate during dual-source computed tomographic scanning was 80 +/- 14 beats/min. Four hundred fifty-nine segments with a vessel caliber >or=1.5 mm according to quantitative coronary angiography were evaluated in 30 patients. Of these, 96% were considered to have excellent or good image quality. IVUS detected CAV in 17 of 30 patients (57%) and in 41 of 110 coronary segments (37%). Compared to IVUS, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for the detection of CAV by DSCT were 85%, 84%, 76%, and 91%, respectively. In conclusion, DSCT permits the investigation of transplant recipients concerning the presence of CAV with good image quality and high diagnostic accuracy.
