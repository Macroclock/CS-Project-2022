Ventricular arrhythmias: state of the art. The management of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation in the cardiac intensive care unit can be complex. These arrhythmias have many triggers, including ischemia, sympathetic stimulation, and medication toxicities, as well as many different substrates, ranging from ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies to rare genetic conditions such as Brugada syndrome and long QT syndrome. Different settings, such as congenital heart disease, postoperative ventricular arrhythmias, and ventricular assist devices, increase the complexity of management. This article reviews the variety of situations and cardiac conditions that give rise to ventricular arrhythmias, focusing on inpatient management strategies.
