Inhaled Iloprost and Oral Sildenafil Combination Therapy: Is it a Chance for Heart Transplant Candidacy? Severe pulmonary hypertension is a risk factor for mortality, due to increased postoperative right ventricular failure, in a heart transplant patient. Elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in heart transplant candidates can be reduced using a left ventricular assist device or medical therapy. This study analysed the effect of inhaled iloprost and oral sildenafil combination therapy (ilo-sil) on pulmonary haemodynamic parameters in patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension. Between May 2011 and April 2014, 25 patients who were unresponsive to reversibility test and PVR >3.5 Wood units (WU) during right heart catheterisation were included in this study. After 6 months of oral sildenafil (3 × 20 mg/day) and inhaled iloprost (6 × 5 μg/day) combination therapy, second right heart catheterisations were performed and eligibility for heart transplant was evaluated. Repeat right heart catheterisation revealed that there was a significant decrease in the PVR from 5.4 ± 1.6 WU to 3.54 ± 2.5 WU (p<0.001), with trans-pulmonary gradient from 13.7 ± 5.6 to 11.46 ± 6.64 (p=0.042), and mean cardiac index (CI) increasing non-significantly from 1.45 ± 0.51 L/min/m2 to 1.82 ± 0.60 (p=0.157). The mean sPAP was initially 57.54 ± 14.79 mmHg and fell to 52.93 ± 16.83 mm Hg (p=0.03). Twenty (20) (80%) patients were enrolled in the waiting list since their PVR values decreased to <3.5 WU. Of these 20 patients, one had undergone heart transplant and four were bridged to transplant with mechanical circulatory support devices. After a decrease in PVR with ilo-sil combination therapy for patients with severe pulmonary hypertension, these patients may become candidates for heart transplant without bearing additional risk. Ilo-sil combination therapy could be a viable option with which to evaluate the reversibility of PVR. 'Heart failure', 'Pulmonary hypertension', 'Vasoreactivity'
