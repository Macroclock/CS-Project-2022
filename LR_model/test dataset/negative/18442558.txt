Argatroban as a primary or secondary postoperative anticoagulant in patients implanted with ventricular assist devices. We describe our experience with argatroban as a primary or secondary postoperative anticoagulant to heparin in patients receiving ventricular assist devices. This is a retrospective review of all Abiomed (BVS5000, AB5000) and Thoratec (PVAD and IVAD) ventricular assist devices from May 2003 through May 2006 at a single institution. Postoperatively, patients received either heparin or argatroban as their anticoagulant. Patients in whom heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was suspected or confirmed were converted from heparin to argatroban. There were 33 Abiomed and Thoratec ventricular assist devices implanted. Thirteen patients received heparin as their primary postoperative anticoagulant; 8 of the 13 were converted to argatroban as a secondary anticoagulant (hep-arg), and 5 patients remained with heparin as their only anticoagulant. Twenty patients received argatroban as their primary and only postoperative anticoagulant. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 26 patients (79%) overall, 16 (80%) with argatroban only, 6 (75%) with hep-arg, and 4 (80%) with heparin only. Thromboembolic events occurred in 5 patients (15%) overall, 3 (15%) with argatroban only, 1 (13%) with hep-arg, and 1 (20%) with heparin only. Postoperative bleeding requiring reexploration occurred in 5 patients overall (15%), 1 with argatroban only (5%), 3 (38%) with hep-arg, and 1 (20%) with heparin only. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay heparin-induced thrombocytopenia tests were positive in 7 patients overall (21%), 5 (25%) with argatroban only, 2 (25%) with hep-arg, and 0 (0%) with heparin only. Argatroban is a comparable primary or secondary anticoagulant to heparin postoperatively in patients receiving ventricular assist devices.
