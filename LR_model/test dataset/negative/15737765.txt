Use of recombinant factor VII to control bleeding in a patient supported by right ventricular assist device after heart transplantation. A 48-year-old man undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation for ischemic cardiomyopathy developed severe right heart failure. Severe intractable bleeding complicated implantation of a right ventricular assist device. Treatment with 9.6 mg of recombinant activated factor VII stopped the bleeding, and the patient could be transferred to the intensive care unit. This is the first reported case of the successful use of recombinant activated factor VII to control bleeding with subsequent right ventricular assist device function.
