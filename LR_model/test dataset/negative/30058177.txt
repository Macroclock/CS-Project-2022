Belatacept for maintenance immunosuppression in cardiothoracic transplantation: The potential frontier. Current immunosuppressive regimens with calcineurin inhibitors have improved the management of patients after transplantation. However, their adverse effects are linked to increased morbidity and limit the long-term survival of heart and lung transplant recipients. Belatacept, a costimulation inhibitor interfering with the interaction between CD28 on T cells and the B7 ligands on antigen presenting cells, has shown success and is currently approved for use in renal transplant recipients. Furthermore, it lacks many of the cardiovascular, metabolic, neurologic, and renal adverse of effects of calcineurin inhibitors that have the largest impact on long-term survival in cardiothoracic transplant. Additionally, it requires no therapeutic drug monitoring and is only administered once a month. Limitations to belatacept use have been observed that must be considered when comparing immunosuppression options. Despite this, maintenance immunosuppression with belatacept has the potential to improve outcomes in cardiothoracic transplant recipients, as it has with kidney transplant recipients. However, no large clinical trials investigating belatacept for maintenance immunosuppression in heart and lung transplant recipients exist. There is a large need for focused research of belatacept in cardiothoracic transplantation. Belatacept is a viable treatment option for maintenance immunosuppression, and it is reasonable to pursue more evidence in cardiothoracic transplant recipients.
