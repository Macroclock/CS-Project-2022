Treg-Cell-Derived IL-35-Coated Extracellular Vesicles Promote Infectious Tolerance. Interleukin-35 (IL-35) is an immunosuppressive cytokine composed of Epstein-Barr-virus-induced protein 3 (Ebi3) and IL-12α chain (p35) subunits, yet the forms that IL-35 assume and its role in peripheral tolerance remain elusive. We induce CBA-specific, IL-35-producing T regulatory (Treg) cells in Treg 'CD81', 'Ebi3', 'IL-35', 'Treg', 'cytokines', 'extracellular vesicles', 'p35', 'tetraspanin', 'tolerance', 'exosome'
