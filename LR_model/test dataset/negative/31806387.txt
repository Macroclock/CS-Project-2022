Incidence, risk factors and prognostic impact of cytomegalovirus infection after heart transplantation. To assess the risk factors of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection after heart transplant (HT) and its influence on long-term prognosis. We conducted a retrospective single-centre study of 222 HT recipients. Risk factors for CMV infection were identified by means of multivariable Cox́s regression. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox́s regression were used to assess the long-term prognostic impact of CMV infection during the first post-transplant year. Donor-recipient CMV serologic matching (hazard ratio [HR] 1.92, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.2-3.09, p=.007), recipient age (HR 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00-1.1, p=.02), diabetes mellitus (HR 1.86, 95% CI: 1.4-3.05, p=.01), pre-transplant circulatory support (HR 1.59, 95% CI: 1.06-2.38, p=.03) and the use of tacrolimus (HR 1.64, 95% CI: 1.13-2.36, p=.009) were independently associated with increased risk of CMV infection. CMV infection during the first year post-HT was not associated with worse transplant outcomes in terms of mortality, incidence of heart failure, cardiac allograft vasculopathy or acute rejection. CMV infection was not associated with impaired long-term prognosis after HT.
