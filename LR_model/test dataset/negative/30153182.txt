Learning to Live Again: The Role of Education in Heart Transplant Recipients. The heart transplant nurse coordinator plays a key role in educating and supporting the postoperative heart transplant patient to achieve the best outcomes for a long and healthy life. The time leading up to transplantation, wait-list candidates will hear vital information regarding life after they have received their life-sustaining heart transplant.
