Changes in multiorgan heart transplants following the 2018 allocation policy change. This study evaluated the impact of the heart allocation policy change in 2018 on the characteristics and outcomes of multiorgan transplants involving heart allografts. Adults undergoing multiorgan heart transplantation from 2010 to 2020 were identified from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry. Transplants were stratified into occurring before versus after the October 2018 heart allocation change. The primary outcome was 1-year survival following transplantation. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the risk-adjusted effect of the allocation policy change on outcomes between cohorts. A total of 1832 patients underwent multiorgan heart transplantation during the study period with 245 (13.37%) undergoing heart-lung transplantation, 244 (13.32%) undergoing heart-liver transplantation, and 1343 (73.31%) undergoing heart-kidney transplantation. There was a higher utilization of temporary MCSDs as well as longer ischemic times for all three types of transplantation following the policy change. Heart-lung and heart-liver recipients had a similar 1-year survival before and after the policy change (each p > .05). Renal failure requiring dialysis (29.5% vs. 39.4%, p = .001) as well as 1-year survival (88% vs. 82%; log-rank p = .01) were worse in the heart-kidney cohort after the organ allocation system modification. This study demonstrates similar trends in multiorgan transplants as has been observed in isolated heart transplants following the allocation change, including more frequent utilization of temporary mechanical support and longer ischemic times. Although outcomes have remained comparable in the new allocation era with heart-lung and heart-liver transplants, heart-kidney recipients have a worse 1-year survival following the change.
