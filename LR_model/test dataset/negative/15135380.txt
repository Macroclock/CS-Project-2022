Effects of changes in UNOS policy regarding left ventricular assist devices. Over the last 6 years, 161 patients underwent implantation of HeartMate single-lead vented electric (SLVE) devices as a bridge to transplantation. SLVE patients were retrospectively analyzed before and after United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) policy changes, and designated SLVE-1 and SLVE-2, respectively. Mean support time decreased significantly from 79.7 +/- 72.0 days to 55.3 +/- 60.5 days (p = 0.022). Although not statistically significant, rate of successful bridging to transplant increased from 70.3% to 74.7%, and post-transplant 1- and 3-year survival increased from 90.0% and 86.0%, respectively, to 92.9% and 87.3%, respectively.
