Heart transplantation in cardiac storage diseases: data on Fabry disease and cardiac amyloidosis. To deeply investigate one type of intracellular cardiac storage disease, the Fabry disease and one example of extracellular cardiac storage disease, the cardiac amyloidosis, with the aim to collect data about cardiac treatment at the end-stage level and the feasibility of heart transplantation (HTx) in this setting of patients. Some registry describes that Fabry disease and cardiac amyloidosis showed similar characteristics as hypertrophic cardiomyopathies; thus, their correct diagnosis is often missing or time consuming. A multiorgan approach is mandatory to recognize the main systemic findings of these diseases, involving also the kidneys, the brain, the autonomous system and the skin. The early diagnosis of these diseases is required to start as soon as possible the correct therapy for the patients affected. However, the end-stage heart failure is common and HTx could be offered to selected patients, especially if affected by light chain cardiac amyloidosis, to allow to perform the autologous stem cell transplantation after the cardiac transplant. Considering the Fabry disease patients, the enzyme recombinant therapy is also mandatory after HTx to avoid potential release of the systemic disease on the donor graft.
