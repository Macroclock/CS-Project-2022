FTY720, an immunosuppressant that alters lymphocyte trafficking, abrogates chronic rejection in combination with cyclosporine A. Chronic rejection remains the leading cause of failure after transplantation (Tx). FTY720, a new immunosuppressant altering lymphocyte trafficking, is effective against acute rejection, but its activity against chronic rejection is not known. A valid model of chronic rejection was produced. Heart transplantation (HTx) was performed using fully mismatched RA (RT1p) and PVG (RT1c) rats. Administration of donor-specific blood transfusion 12 days before HTx prolongs graft survival, but features of chronic rejection including intimal hyperplasia and vascular obliteration (VO) develop with time only in allogeneic Tx. This is therefore a valid model of chronic rejection. VO was assessed on post-Tx day 90 in six groups differing according to the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen administered. group 1, donor-specific blood transfusion only and no other treatment; group 2, FTY720 (0.3 mg/kg/day orally) for 90 days; group 3, cyclosporine A (CsA) (1 mg/kg/day orally) for 90 days; group 4, combined administration of FTY720 and CsA for 90 days; group 5, transient administration of combined FTY720 and CsA for 7 days; and group 6, syngeneic HTx (RA to RA). Graft infiltrate, endothelial immunoglobulin (Ig) G deposition, and complement binding were also examined on post-Tx day 90. In control group 1, severe VO was observed, compared with syngeneic HTx (group 6). Monotherapy with FTY720 (group 2) or with CsA (group 3) significantly but partially reduced VO. On the contrary, combined administration of FTY720 and CsA (group 4) abrogated VO. A 1-week treatment with combined FTY720 and CsA (group 5) reduced VO but only partially. In group 1, arteriosclerosis was accompanied by graft infiltrate, endothelial IgG deposition, and complement binding. In groups 2, 3, and 5, graft infiltrating scores were partially decreased compared with group 1 but remained higher than in syngeneic controls; endothelial IgG deposition and complement binding were still present. In group 4, continuous administration of combined FTY720 and CsA reduced graft infiltrate to the level of syngeneic control and abrogated both endothelial IgG deposition and complement binding. Maintenance treatment with either FTY720 or CsA monotherapy partially prevents chronic rejection; short-term treatment with combined FTY720 and CsA reduces chronic rejection only partially; and continuous treatment with combined FTY720 and CsA abrogates chronic rejection, and this is accompanied by dramatic reduction of graft infiltrating cells, endothelial IgG deposition, and complement binding. Prevention of chronic rejection by maintenance treatment with FTY720 and CsA represents indirect evidence that normal lymphocyte trafficking and function are mandatory for development of chronic rejection.
