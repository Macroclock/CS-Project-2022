A strategy of hypothermic circulatory arrest for difficult heart transplant postventricular assist device. Donor heart and ventricular assist device excision can be extremely difficult at the time of heart transplant. We present a strategy of hypothermic circulatory arrest established with ventricular assist device cannulas for difficult heart transplants. The device inlet or outlet cannulas already in place, or both, are used to complement the safe cannulation sites available. This approach permits controlled excision of the recipient heart and device, easy access to convert to standard ascending aorta and bicaval cannulation, and minimizes the donor graft anoxia time. Two case reports are presented.
