Current status of lung transplantation in Poland: experience of the Silesian Center for Heart Diseases. Until the year 2001, lung transplantation was not available in Poland, as the only one among other kinds of solid organs transplantation. In 2001, in the Silesian Center for Heart Diseases the first successful combined heart-lung-one-block transplantation was performed. In 2003 and 2004, a successful single lung transplantation in Poland was performed in our center. Here the authors presented their experience with lung transplantation including the indications for specific types of transplantation, the immunosuppressive regimen, the management of early and late stages after lung transplantation, the infection complications, and the current problems with lung transplantation progress.
