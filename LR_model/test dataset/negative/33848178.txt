Metformin therapy and risk of cancer in patients after heart transplantation. Diabetes mellitus (DM) and malignancy are recognized among the most common complications increasing mortality in patients after heart transplantation (HTx). Clinical trials have shown a higher risk for different types of tumours in diabetic patients. This risk is potentiated by immunosuppressive therapy in transplant patients. Biguanide metformin has been shown to exhibit anti-tumour activity and we tried to find out whether this effect is valid for heart transplant patients. We retrospectively analysed a group of 497 patients, who undergone HTx in our centre between 1998 and 2019. The primary outcome was any malignancy during the 15-year follow-up period and patient's survival. Out of the 497 patients enrolled in the study, 279 (56 %) had diabetes and 52 (19 %) were treated with metformin. Fifteen-year survival in treated patients without malignancy was 93 %, the remainder for the DM patients was 56 %, with survival in non-DM patients being 74 %. Untreated diabetic patients had 4.7 times higher chance of malignancy than those on metformin (p = 0.01). Fifteen-year survival in metformin treated patients was 53 %, in other DM patients 44 %, and in non-DM patients 51 %. Our study showed a significantly lower incidence of malignancies in metformin-treated patients and slightly better overall survival (Tab. 2, Fig. 3, Ref. 19) Keywords: biguanide, heart graft, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, survival.
