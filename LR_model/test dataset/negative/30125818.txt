Fatty acids profile in patients after heart or renal transplantation who developed metabolic complications. Diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia are frequently observed after organ transplantation. It is known that in these disorders the fatty acid metabolism is impaired. The aim of this study was to compare the fatty acid profile in the heart and renal transplant recipients who developed metabolic disorders since there is no such research available. The study included 55 patients treated with tacrolimus (Tac) after heart (n = 14; mean age: 60.4 ± 9.1) or renal (n = 41; mean age: 51 ± 13) transplantation. Diabetes and hyperlipidemia was present in 35.7% and 28.5% of heart transplant recipients, and 19.5% and 41% of renal transplant recipients. Concentrations of fatty acid in phospholipids fraction in serum were measured by gas chromatography. The concentration of C20:5 fatty acid was lower in heart transplant recipients, as compared to renal transplant recipients (p = 0.001), whereas the level of C20+C18:3 fatty acid and the ratio of n-6/n-3 was higher (p = 0.01; p = 0.03, respectively). The observed differences were not related to metabolic disorders. Negative correlation between C16:1 and eGFR was seen in heart transplant recipients (p = 001). In renal transplant recipients with metabolic disorders, the concentration of C20:5 was correlated positively whereas the n-6/n-3 ratio was correlated negatively with eGFR (p < 0.001, p = 0.01, respectively). Hyperlipidemic renal transplant recipients had higher concentration of C20:2 (p = 0.02), C20:4 (p = 0.05), n-6 (0.04) and total fatty acid (p = 0.01) than patients without metabolic disorders. The fatty acid profile differs depending on the transplanted organ, but the differences are not related to the metabolic disorders. The role of fatty acid in kidney function varies between heart transplant recipients and renal transplant recipients and depends on type of fatty acid.
