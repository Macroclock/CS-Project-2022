Heart transplantation in a patient with multiple sclerosis and mitoxantrone-induced cardiomyopathy. We describe a 30-year-old man with end-stage heart failure after therapy with mitoxantrone for multiple sclerosis. A successful orthotopic heart transplantation was performed when intensified medical therapy failed to improve the patient's hemodynamics. In spite of the severe underlying disease he did well on dual immunosuppression with methylprednisone and cyclosporine. Neurologic symptoms remained stable throughout the procedure and, after 2 months, he resumed preoperative ambulatory status. Eight years after the operation, the patient is now in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I status. Using canes, he is able to walk short distances. Repeated urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli became a problem, but have been controlled by long-term oral antibiotic prophylaxis with trimethoprim.
