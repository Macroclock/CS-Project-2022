CD2 is a dominant target for allogeneic responses. CD2 and 2B4 (CD244) are members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily and are both ligands for another family member, CD48. CD2 is widely distributed on T, NK, and B cells and some antigen-presenting cells, while 2B4 is expressed on NK and some T cells and monocytes and is known to participate in NK cytotoxicity. Since indefinite allograft survival could be obtained by a combination of anti-CD48 plus anti-CD2 mAb administration, it was important to determine the role of 2B4 blockade in allograft rejection. MAbs directed against CD2, CD48, or 2B4 were administered singly or in pairs to cardiac allograft recipients. The experiments show that only anti-CD2 plus anti-CD48 mAbs result in indefinite allograft survival, while anti-CD2 plus anti-2B4 mAbs substantially prolong graft survival, and anti-CD48 plus anti-2B4 mAbs were no better than each mAb alone. The effect of these mAbs on anti-CD3 mAb and alloantigen-driven proliferation and IFN-gamma production were also assessed. In general, anti-CD2 inhibited both anti-CD3 mAb and alloantigen-driven responses, while anti-CD48 inhibited only anti-CD3 mAb but not alloantigen-driven proliferative and cytokine responses. Anti-2B4 mAbs were generally ineffective alone. Combinations of mAbs were more effective than single mAbs only in alloantigen-driven proliferation, commensurate with allograft survival results. Using CD2-/- and CD48-/- T cells and antigen-presenting cells, we also demonstrate that these inhibitory mAbs act primarily by blocking intercellular interactions, rather than directly delivering negative signals to T cells. These results suggest that, unlike CD2, 2B4 is not a potent regulatory molecule or ligand for CD48 in the response to alloantigen. Blocking the 2B4-CD48 receptor-ligand pair does not inhibit T-cell responses and alloreactivity to the same degree as CD2-CD48 blockade.
