Prognostic Value of Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing in Heart Failure With Reduced, Midrange, and Preserved Ejection Fraction. This study aimed to compare the independent and incremental prognostic value of peak oxygen consumption (VO In 195 HFpEF (LVEF ≥50%), 144 HFmEF (LVEF 40-49%), and 630 HFrEF (LVEF <40%) patients, we assessed the association of cardiopulmonary exercise testing variables with the composite outcome of death, left ventricular assist device implantation, or heart transplantation (256 events; median follow-up of 4.2 years), and 2-year incident HF hospitalization (244 events). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, greater association with outcomes in HFpEF than HFrEF were noted with peak VO Both peak VO 'cardiopulmonary exercise testing', 'ejection fraction', 'heart failure', 'oxygen consumption', 'preserved ejection fraction'
