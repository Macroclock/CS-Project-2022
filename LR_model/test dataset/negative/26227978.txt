[Ventricular assist device – Possibilities of long-term mechanical circulatory support]. In Switzerland 200’000 people suffer from congestive heart failure. Approximately 10’000 patients find themselves in an advanced state of the disease. When conservative treatment options are no longer available heart transplantation is the therapy of choice. Should this not be an option due to long waiting lists or medical issues assist device therapy becomes an option. Assist device therapy is separated in short-term and long-term support. Long-term support is nowadays performed with ventricular assist devices (VADs). The native heart is still in place and supported in parallel to the remaining function of the heart. The majority of patients are treated with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). The right ventrical alone (RVAD) as well as bi-ventricular support (BiVAD) is rarely needed. The modern VADs are implantable and create a non-pulsative bloodflow. A percutaneous driveline enables energy supply and pump-control. Indication strategies for VAD implantations include bridge to transplant (short term support), bridge to candidacy and bridge to transplant. VADs become more and more a definite therapeutic option (destination therapy). VAD therapy might be a realistic alternative to organ transplantation in the near future.
