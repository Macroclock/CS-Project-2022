Low troponin-I levels on admission are associated with worse prognosis in patients with fulminant myocarditis. The clinical outcomes of patients with fulminant acute myocarditis (FAM) range from death to complete recovery. We sought to identify clinical, biological, and echocardiographic characteristics of prognostic value for this population. We prospectively included 185 patients with the diagnosis of acute myocarditis who were admitted to our institution between 2000 and 2007, selecting 15 who displayed FAM, namely, severe congestive heart failure or cardiogenic shock, requiring inotropic and/or mechanical circulatory support. Their mean age was 27.9 +/- 12.4 years (range, 12-52) and mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 22 +/- 8.4% (range, 10-35). Seven subjects had poor outcomes, defined as death (n = 4), urgent transplantation (x = 2), or persistent left ventricular dysfunction (n = 3). The other 6 individuals experienced complete recovery of ventricular function. Troponin-I values below 1 ng/mL on admission were significantly associated with greater in-hospital (P = .05) and mid-term poor outcomes (P = .001). Additionally, patients with poor outcomes showed significantly lower LVEF (17.6 +/- 6.2% vs 28.8 +/- 6.9%; P = .006). Among patients with FAM, normal or minimal elevation of troponin-I and low LVEF on admission were associated with worse in-hospital and mid-term prognosis.
