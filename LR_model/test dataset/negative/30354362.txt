Effect of Everolimus Initiation and Calcineurin Inhibitor Elimination on Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy in De Novo Heart Transplant Recipients. Background Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) limits survival after heart transplantation, and the effect of different immunosuppressive regimens on CAV is not fully understood. The randomized SCHEDULE trial (Scandinavian Heart Transplant Everolimus De Novo Study With Early Calcineurin Inhibitors Avoidance) evaluated whether initiation of the proliferation signal inhibitor everolimus and early cyclosporine elimination can reduce CAV development. Methods and Results The SCHEDULE trial was a multicenter Scandinavian trial, where 115 de novo heart transplantation recipients were randomized to everolimus with complete cyclosporine withdrawal 7 to 11 weeks after heart transplantation or standard cyclosporine-based immunosuppression. Seventy-six (66%) patients had matched intravascular ultrasound examinations at baseline and 12 and 36 months. Intravascular ultrasound analysis evaluated maximal intimal thickness, percent atheroma volume, and total atheroma volume. Qualitative plaque analysis using virtual histology assessed fibrous, fibrofatty, and calcified tissue as well as necrotic core. Serum inflammatory markers were measured in parallel. The everolimus group (n=37) demonstrated significantly reduced CAV progression as compared with the cyclosporine group (n=39) at 36 months (Δ maximal intimal thickness, 0.09±0.05 versus 0.15±0.16 mm [ P=0.03]; Δ percent atheroma volume, 5.3±2.8% versus 7.6±5.9% [ P=0.03]; and Δ total atheroma volume, 33.9±71.2 versus 54.2±96.0 mm 'allograft', 'calcineurin inhibitors', 'cyclosporine', 'everolimus', 'heart transplantation'
