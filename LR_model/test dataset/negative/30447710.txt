Advanced Heart Failure Management and Transplantation. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic heart disease with heterogeneous clinical features, including progression to advanced heart failure. The development of these symptoms can be related to outflow obstruction but in some patients reflects an underlying process of fibrosis and progressive ventricular dysfunction. For patients with end-stage disease, traditional heart failure therapies have not proved beneficial. As such, more advanced therapies, such as left ventricular assist device or cardiac transplantation, should be considered for these patients. Although left ventricular assist device support is used infrequently due to the restrictive physiology underlying hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, transplant represents an effective treatment, with encouraging long-term outcome data.
