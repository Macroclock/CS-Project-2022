Subcutaneous panniculitic T-cell lymphoma in a cardiac allograft recipient. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is the third leading cause of death in heart transplant patients beyond the immediate peri-operative period (Ouseph R, Denny DM, Erbeck KM. J Am Soc Echocardiogr 1998; 11: 758; Armitage JM, Kormos RL, Stuart RS, et al. J Heart Lung Transplant 1991; 10: 877; Swinnen LJ, Mullen M, Carr TJ, et al. Blood 1995; 86: 3333; Ying AJ, Myerowitz D, Marsh WL. Ann Thorac Surg 1997; 64: 1822). The majority of PTLD cases are of B-cell origin whereas T-cell neoplasms have been reported as rare, aggressive, and late complications of solid-organ transplantation (Fatio R, Sutsch G, Mayer K, et al. Transplant Proc 1998; 30: 1118). A 50-year-old cardiac allograft heart transplant patient presented with subcutaneous nodules involving his trunk and extremities. Light microscopy revealed features characteristic of subcutaneous panniculitic-like T-cell lymphoma. Immunohistochemical analysis showed expression for CD45RO, TIA-1, and focal CD3 positivity by tumor cells. Flow cytometry performed on a subsequent subcutaneous nodule demonstrated an abnormal T-cell population with expression of CD3, CD8, CD56, and T-cell receptor alpha-beta, and no expression of CD4. T-cell gene rearrangement studies revealed a clonal population of cells with a bi-allelic gene rearrangement. We report a case of an unusual subtype of PTLD in a cardiac allograft recipient.
