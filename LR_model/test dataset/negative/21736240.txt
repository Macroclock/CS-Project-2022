Capnocytophagia canimorsus sepsis in an asplenic heart transplant candidate with a left ventricular assist system. Fulminant septic shock associated with Capnocytophagia canimorsus bacteremia developed in a 54-year-old asplenic man, a heart transplantation candidate who was supported with a HeartMate II left ventricular assist system, after he experienced a dog bite. He improved after administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which were narrowed to ampicillin/sulbactam for a prolonged 6-week course, and subsequently recovered fully.
