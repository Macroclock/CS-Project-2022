Limitations of high urgency listing--ventricular assist device support in a neonate for 452 days. The Eurotransplant International Foundation in Leiden, the Netherlands, is responsible for mediation and allocation of organ donation procedures to its member countries Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Slovenia. To provide organs for the patients who require urgent transplantation, the "high urgent (HU)" status was introduced in 2001 in Germany . This new HU allocation system is applicable to neonates as well as adults. However, waiting times on HU status exceed several weeks to months. Therefore an increasing number of pediatric patients has to undergo implantation of a ventricular assist device (VAD). In the present report we discuss the current Eurotransplant heart allocation system for pediatric heart transplantation in the light of a neonate with 452 days on mechanical support. We compare the average waiting time of patients on HU status at our center and their outcome in 2007 and 2008 (Data obtained from Eurotransplant International Foundation). Waiting time on HU status in our center increased significantly from 2007 to 2008. Therefore more patients require VAD support as bridging to transplantation. The case of a neonate under long-term VAD support is an outstanding example of the negative effects of this development.
