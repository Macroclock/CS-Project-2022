Novel use of an FDA-approved BiVAD for total cardiopulmonary support. We describe the use of an Abiomed BVS 5000i with an oxygenator spliced into the right side for total cardiopulmonary support after orthotopic heart transplantation. As compared to ECMO, we believe that the mechanical ventricular unloading seen with this type of assist device increases the likelihood of myocardial recovery. This report demonstrates that even with an in-line oxygenator, adequate flow can be delivered to both the RVAD and LVAD, providing complete cardiopulmonary support.
