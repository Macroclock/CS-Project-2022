Acquired Glanzmann's thrombasthenia as part of multiple-autoantibody syndrome in a pediatric heart transplant patient. Although advances in immunosuppressive therapy have allowed prolonged patient survival, immune dysregulation observed in these patients has increased. We report an 11-year-old female heart transplant recipient in whom Glanzmann thrombasthenia was identified as part of a "multiple autoantibody syndrome" manifesting sequentially as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia.
