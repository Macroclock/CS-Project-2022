Speckle-tracking 2-dimensional strain echocardiography: a new noninvasive imaging tool to evaluate acute rejection in cardiac transplantation. There remains no reliable non-invasive method to detect cardiac transplant rejection. Recently, speckle-tracking 2-dimensional strain echocardiography (2DSE) was shown to be sensitive in the early detection of myocardial dysfunction in various models of cardiomyopathy. We aim to determine if 2DSE-derived functional indices can detect cardiac transplant rejection. Heterotopic rat cardiac transplantation was performed in histocompatible isografts or histoincompatible allografts. Histologic rejection scores were determined. Short-axis, mid-left ventricular (LV) echocardiography was performed on Day 6 after transplantation. Conventional measures of function were measured, (including LV fractional shortening and ejection fraction) as well as 2DSE parameters. Despite class IIIB rejection in allografts and no rejection in isografts, there was no difference between isografts vs allografts in fractional shortening (15% +/- 3% vs 12% +/- 3%) or ejection fraction (36% +/- 5% vs 26% +/- 6%; both not significant). In contrast, 2DSE revealed decreases between isografts and allografts in global radial strain (12.6% +/- 5.6% vs 1.1% +/- 0.2%, p < 0.05), peak radial systolic strain rate (3.10 +/- 0.74/s vs 0.54 +/- 0.13/s, p < 0.001), and peak circumferential systolic strain rate (-1.99 +/- 0.55 vs -0.43 +/- 0.11/s; p < 0.01). Systolic strain imaging using 2DSE differentiates myocardial function between experimental cardiac transplant rejection in allografts and non-rejection in isografts. Therefore, 2DSE may be useful in early non-invasive detection of transplant rejection.
