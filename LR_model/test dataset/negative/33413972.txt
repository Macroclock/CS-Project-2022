[Pathology of heart transplantation: Where are we now?] Pathology is still the gold standard for the diagnosis of rejection in heart transplantation. During the last decade, molecular pathology has emerged as a powerful tool for the understanding of the processes implicated in allograft rejection. Transcriptomic analysis of the allograft may also help the pathologist for diagnosis and accurate classification of rejection. This review will describe the recent advances and perspectives of molecular pathology in the field of heart transplantation.
