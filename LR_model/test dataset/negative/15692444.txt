[Epstein-Barr virus-associated cutaneous plasmacytoma post-solid organ transplantation]. Post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders develop in 1 to 10p. 100 of organ transplant recipients and are frequently associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Among post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders, plasmacytoma with cutaneous involvement is exceptional. Association with EBV has been rarely reported in post-transplantation plasmacytomas and the latency type of EBV has never been characterized. We report 2 new cases of cutaneous monotype EBV-related plasmacytomas. Clinical presentation was a sub-cutaneous tumor on the thigh in the first case and an ulcerated nodule of the leg in the second case, occurring respectively 7 and 8 years after organ transplantation (liver transplantation and heart transplantation). In both lesions, tumor cells exhibited lambda light chain restriction and the association with EBV was confirmed using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. The expression of EBV genes in tumor cells demonstrated type III latency. The classification of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders is not well defined and some authors retain 3 categories. Among the latter, plasmacytomas have been rarely described. Cutaneous involvement is reported in 4 cases and an association with EBV in only 2 cases without description of viral latency. Clinical and histological features of post-transplantation plasmacytomas appear polymorphic. We report EBV-association in both cases, with a type III latency clearly demonstrated in one case, as has been reported in other lymphoproliferative diseases in patients with congenital or acquired immunodeficiency. We also discuss various possible therapeutic strategies for post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders.
