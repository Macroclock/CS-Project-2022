Cancer Incidence in Heart Transplant Recipients With Previous Neoplasia History. Neoplasm history increases morbidity and mortality after solid organ transplantation and has disqualified patients from transplantation. Studies are needed to identify factors to be considered when deciding on the suitability of a patient with previous tumor for heart transplantation. A retrospective epidemiological study was conducted in heart transplant (HT) recipients (Spanish Post-Heart Transplant Tumor Registry) comparing the epidemiological data, immu-nosuppressive treatments and incidence of post-HT tumors between patients with previous malignant noncardiac tumor and with no previous tumor (NPT). The impact of previous tumor (PT) on overall survival (OS) was also assessed. A total of 4561 patients, 77 PT and 4484 NPT, were evaluated. The NPT group had a higher proportion of men than the PT group (p < 0.001). The incidence of post-HT tumors was 1.8 times greater in the PT group (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-2.6; p < 0.001), mainly due to the increased risk in patients with a previous hematologic tumor (rate ratio 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-4.0, p < 0.004). OS during the 10-year posttransplant period was significantly lower in the PT than the NPT group (p = 0.048) but similar when the analysis was conducted after a first post-HT tumor was diagnosed. In conclusion, a history of PT increases the incidence of post-HT tumors and should be taken into account when considering a patient for HT.
