Outcome after pediatric heart transplantation: two decades of a single center experience. Twenty years after the first successful pediatric heart transplantation (HTx), the long-term outcome of this population is still unknown. Current study analyzes our results in pediatric HTx population. Between 1985 and 2005, we performed 604 HTx. Forty-three patients (7%) were less than 18-years old and six patients were less than 1-year old. Mean age at HTx was 9.7+/-6.3 years (38 days-18 years). Indications were: cardiomyopathy in 33 patients (76%), congenital in 9 (21%), tumor in 1 (3%). Chronic immunosuppression was Cyclosporine A and Azathioprine-based. Overall survival at Kaplan-Meier analysis (CI 95%) was 82.5% at 1-year post-HTx, 73.5% at 5 years, 72.2% at 10 years, 62.1% at 15 years, and 49.3% at 20 years, respectively. We had 14 deaths (32%): 7 within the first year after HTx (early mortality, EM), 7 occurred later (late mortality, LM). Causes of EM were: graft failure (43%), acute rejection (43%) and post transplant lymphoproliferative disease (14%). Causes of LM were: neoplasms (57%), infection (28%), graft vasculopathy (15%). At late follow-up, cardiac function, somatic and psycoaffective development were normal. Fifteen patients (34%) developed neoplasms, nine patients (21%) hypertension, and three patients (8%) developed kidney dysfunction. Neoplasms were found to be an independent predictor of outcome (p=0.039) (OR=7). Overall survival in the pediatric population is better than adults' population (62.1 vs 48% at 15 years after HTx). Neoplasms were the main comorbidities and causes of LM: at multivariate analysis, their incidence was related with hematic Cyclosporine A levels after 10 years from HTx (p=0.01).
