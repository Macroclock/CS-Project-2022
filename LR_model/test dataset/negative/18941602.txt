Bridge to transplantation with the TandemHeart: bending the indications in a chronic aortic dissection patient with postcardiotomy shock. Herein, we report a successful bridge to heart transplantation by use of the TandemHeart percutaneous ventricular assist device (pVAD) in a chronic aortic dissection patient who was experiencing postcardiotomy shock. The patient had undergone an aortocoronary bypass to treat an acute, extensive myocardial infarction that had resulted from severe stenosis of a Cabrol-like graft to the left main coronary artery. The TandemHeart was used successfully, despite classic contraindications for pVAD support. The outcome shows that, in critically ill cardiogenic shock patients, a permissive approach to pVAD use is valuable in screening candidates for long-term ventricular assist device support or for heart transplantation. This case also reveals the validity of direct bridging to transplantation from a pVAD in carefully selected patients.
