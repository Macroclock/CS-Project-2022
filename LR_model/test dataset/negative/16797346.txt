Successful heterotopic heart transplant after cardiopulmonary bypass rescue of an arrested donor heart. Global heart transplantation has declined due to the donor shortage. The use of marginal donors has therefore been reintroduced. According to the history of heart transplantation, heterotopic heart transplant has played an important role in the precyclosporine era. In those circumstances, native heart and donor heart worked together to support each other against rejection or progressive heart failure. However, heterotopic transplantation has complicated surgical techniques and requirements for postoperative surveillance. Most training fellows have limited experience with this approach. At present more than 1000 cardiac surgical centers perform heart transplantation, but only 50 centers have experience in performing-heterotopic procedures. Using mechanical circulatory support for the posttransplant period is well developed in most centers. However, using mechanical circulatory support for heart donor with the intention of rescuing the heart has not been reported. Herein, we report a successful heterotopic heart transplantation after rescue with cardiopulmonary bypass of an arrested donor heart.
