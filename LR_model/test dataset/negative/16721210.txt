Treatment of refractory heart failure with a percutaneous circulatory support device. End-stage heart failure refractory to medical therapy is a clinical challenge. Heart transplantation is considered the best strategy, but it remains burdened with substantial limitations due to the scanty availability of facilities with a transplant programme, donor shortage, and unpredictable waiting lists. Alternatively, assist devices may allow an improvement of the haemodynamic conditions, modifying the history of end-stage heart failure and introducing new management strategies. The goal of a minimally invasive short-term circulatory support device in the treatment of end-stage heart failure patients awaiting heart transplant is to restore the haemodynamic conditions and to improve end-organ dysfunction, with a low incidence of major adverse cardiac events. This report describes the first implantation in Italy of a new percutaneous circulatory support device, the Cancion cardiac recovery system, in a patient with severe end-stage heart failure listed for transplantation.
