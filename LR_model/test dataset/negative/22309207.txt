Mitral valve surgery for severe mitral regurgitation and dilated cardiomyopathy--a bridge to transplant: case report and a review of literature. We report a child with myocardial necrosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and severe mitral valve (MV) regurgitation following neonatal enteroviral myocarditis. He underwent MV annuloplasty at 18 months and MV replacement at 3 years of age. He remains asymptomatic on medical therapy at 8 years of age. Mitral valve surgery may stabilize the evolution of dilated cardiomyopathy and delay the ultimate need for heart transplant.
