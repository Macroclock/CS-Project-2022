Low HDL-C predicts the onset of transplant vasculopathy in pediatric cardiac recipients on pravastatin therapy. The levels and protein/lipid compositions of major lipoprotein particles of 19 pediatric cardiac transplant recipients (4-18 yr of age) were studied in this prospective, open clinical follow-up study before and at one yr of pravastatin therapy (10 mg/day). The recipients were grouped into those with (n = 6; group A) and those without (n = 13; group B) angiographically detectable vasculopathy. Twenty-one pediatric non-transplant controls were studied at baseline. At baseline, the group A recipients had 29% lower HDL-C concentrations (p = 0.031) and 29% higher apoB-100/apoA-I ratios (p = 0.034) than the group B recipients. At one yr of pravastatin, the respective figures were 29% (p = 0.013) and 33% (p = 0.005). Compared with the healthy pediatric controls, the transplant recipients had significantly higher serum TG before pravastatin [median (range): 1.3 mmol/L (0.6-3.2) vs. 0.7 mmol/L (0.3-2.4), p = 0.0002] and at one yr [1.3 mmol/L (0.5-3.5) vs. 0.7 mmol/L (0.3-2.4), p = 0.0004]. The baseline apoB-100/apoA1 ratios of the recipients were 33% higher (p = 0.005). In conclusion, low HDL-C and high apoB-100/apoA-I ratio were associated with angiographically detectable vasculopathy. Even though pravastatin effectively lowered the TC and LDL-C and improved compositional properties of LDL and HDL(2) particles, it failed to normalize the elevated TG and, in some patients, to prevent the progression of transplant vasculopathy.
