Impact of increased donor distances following adult heart allocation system changes: A single center review of 1-year outcomes. On October 18, 2018, several changes to the donor heart allocation system were enacted. We hypothesize that patients undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) under the new allocation system will see an increase in ischemic times, rates of primary graft dysfunction, and 1-year mortality due to these changes. In this single-center retrospective study, we reviewed the charts of all OHT patients from October 2017 through October 2019. Pre- and postallocation recipient demographics were compared. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. A total of 184 patients underwent OHT. Recipient demographics were similar between cohorts. The average distance from donor increased by more than 150 km (p = .006). Patients in the postallocation change cohort demonstrated a significant increase in the rate of severe left ventricle primary graft dysfunction from 5.4% to 18.7% (p = .005). There were no statistically significant differences in 30-day mortality or 1-year survival. Time on the waitlist was reduced from 203.8 to 103.7 days (p = .006). Changes in heart allocation resulted in shorter waitlist times at the expense of longer donor distances and ischemic times, with an associated negative impact on early post-transplantation outcomes. No significant differences in 30-day or 1-year mortality were observed. 'allocation', 'distance', 'heart transplant', 'primary graft dysfunction', 'status'
