Long-term heart transplant recipients: heart rate-related effects on augmented transfer function coherence during repeated squat-stand maneuvers in males. Previous research has highlighted that squat-stand maneuvers (SSMs) augment coherence values within the cerebral pressure-flow relationship to âˆ¼0.99. However, it is not fully elucidated if mean arterial pressure (MAP) leads to this physiological entrainment independently, or if heart rate (HR) and/or the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pco 'cardiac baroreflex', 'cerebral autoregulation', 'squat-stand maneuvers', 'transcranial Doppler ultrasound', 'transfer function analysis'
