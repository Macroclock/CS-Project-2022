Current induction immunosuppression and post-heart transplant lymphoproliferative disorders. The use of high-dose OKT3 has been reported to be associated with a high incidence of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) in heart transplantation (HTx) recipients. The incidence and characteristics of PTLD with current induction protocols remain largely unknown. The aim of our study was to analyze the incidence and characteristics of PTLD in a large series of HTx recipients treated with low-dose OKT3 induction. From 1984 to 2002, a retrospective review of diagnosis, treatment, and evolution of PTLD cases was performed on the 560 patients who underwent HTx in our center. The incidence of PTLD was 1% (6/560). The disease occurred early after HTx in two cases and between 13 and 121 months in the other four. Molecular studies showed evidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in four patients. B-cell proliferation was observed in five cases, and T-cell proliferation in the other one. Various therapies were employed for each patient. Ganciclovir and reduction in immunosuppression were the most common measures. Interestingly, OKT3 was used as a specific anti-T-cell proliferation agent with some success in the one case of T-cell PTLD. Complete remission was achieved in just two patients, whereas the other four (67%) died, mostly due to other conditions. The use of low-dose OKT3 as induction therapy did not increase the incidence of PTLD in our series. Late appearance of disease prevailed among our patients. Despite a multidisciplinary approach to therapy, including the use of OKT3 against T-cell proliferation, the mortality rate was high (67%).
