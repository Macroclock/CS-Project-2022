Stromal Cell-Derived Factor-1 Mediates Cardiac Allograft Tolerance Induced by Human Endometrial Regenerative Cell-Based Therapy. Endometrial regenerative cells (ERCs) are mesenchymal-like stromal cells, and their therapeutic potential has been tested in the prevention of renal ischemic reperfusion injury, acute liver injury, ulcerative colitis, and immunosuppression. However, their potential in the induction of transplant tolerance has not been investigated. The present study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of ERCs in inducing cardiac allograft tolerance and the function of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in the ERC-mediated immunoregulation. The inhibitory efficacy of human ERCs in the presence or absence of rapamycin was examined in both mouse cardiac allograft models between BALB/c (H-2 'Allograft tolerance', 'Cardiac transplantation', 'Human endometrial regenerative cells', 'Mice', 'Stromal cell-derived factor-1'
