A case study in Hansen's disease acquired after heart transplant. Hansen's disease, leprosy, is a chronic infectious disease caused by the acid-fast bacillus Mycobacterium leprae. There are multiple forms of the disease ranging from the relatively benign to the progressive, malignant lepromatous leprosy. There is effective antimicrobial treatment available that is capable of curing the disease. We report the case of a post heart transplant patient acquiring Hansen's disease.
