Less invasive implantation of HeartWare left ventricular assist device. Mechanical support by means of ventricular assist devices is at present the most promising alternative of efforts aimed at increasing the supply of donor organs. The support of the left dysfunctional ventricle enables appropriate haemodynamic stabilization and recovery of secondary organ failure, often present in these severely ill patients. The current results of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy for bridge to transplantation are excellent when compared with the outcome without the availability of this therapy. Additionally, a rapid extubation of these patients has demonstrated to be efficient in cardiac surgery for faster recovery and rehabilitation. Consequently, in recent years, surgical objectives have become much more clearly defined, and the concept of less invasive cardiac surgery can be applied to make this operation less complicated, anatomically focused with a greater clinical impact. We describe an LVAD implantation technique, applying the concept of less invasive cardiac surgery, consisting in the association of reduced surgical approaches, off-pump implantation and reduced administration of heparin dose, in order to achieve rapid extubation and rehabilitation of the patient, preserving low morbidity, and still meeting all the goals of the standard procedure.
