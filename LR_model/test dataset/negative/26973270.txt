Everolimus Attenuates Myocardial Hypertrophy and Improves Diastolic Function in Heart Transplant Recipients. Everolimus (EVL), one of the mammalian targets of rapamycin, is a next generation immunosuppressant that may have accessory anti-proliferative effects in heart transplant (HTx) recipients. However, little is known about the clinical relationship between EVL and regression of cardiac hypertrophy. A total of 42 HTx recipients received EVL therapy at post-HTx 150 days on median and had been followed at our institute for > 1 year between 2008 and 2014 [EVL (+) group]. We also observed 18 patients without EVL from post-HTx 150 days for 1 year [EVL (-) group]. There were no significant differences in baseline variables between the two groups. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and the ratio of early transmitral filling velocity to the peak early diastolic mitral annular motion velocity (E/e') decreased significantly during 1-year EVL treatment compared with the EVL (-) group. There were no differences in blood pressure and medications between the 2 groups. Improvement of LVMI and the E/e' ratio was not associated with trough levels of calcineurin inhibitors or EVL, but correlated with each baseline value. In conclusion, this EVL-incorporated immunosuppressant regimen attenuated cardiac hypertrophy as well as diastolic dysfunction in HTx recipients.
