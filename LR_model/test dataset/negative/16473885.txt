Heme oxygenase-1 is essential for and promotes tolerance to transplanted organs. This investigation focused on obtaining a further understanding of the role of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in tolerance induction. Hearts from C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice survived long-term when transplanted into BALB/c (H-2d) recipients treated with the tolerance-inducing regimen of anti-CD40L antibody (MR-1) plus donor-specific transfusion (DST). Grafts did not, however, survive long-term in (HO-1-/-) recipients given the same treatment. Similarly, long-term survival induced by DST was ablated when HO-1 activity was blocked by zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX). We further asked whether modulation of HO-1 expression/activity could be used to promote the induction of graft tolerance. DST alone (day 0) failed to promote any prolongation of survival of DBA/2 (H-2d) hearts transplanted into B6AF1 (H-2(b,k/d)) recipients. However, long-term survival and (dominant peripheral) tolerance were readily induced when DST was combined with induction of HO-1 expression by cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX). HO-1 induction plus DST led to a significant up-regulation of Foxp3, TGF-beta, IL-10, and CTLA4, which suggests a prominent role for CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). In fact, the tolerogenic effect of HO-1 plus DST was dependent on CD4+CD25+ Tregs as suggested by adoptively transferring these cells into irradiated recipients under various regimens. Taken together, these findings show that expression of HO-1 in a graft recipient can be essential for long-term graft survival and for induction of tolerance and that modulation of HO-1 expression/activity can be used therapeutically to synergize in the generation of graft tolerance.
