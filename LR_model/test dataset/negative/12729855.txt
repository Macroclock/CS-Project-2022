Surgical therapy in advanced heart failure. Congestive heart failure (CHF) affects about 1% of adults in the United States and is a contributing factor in >250,000 deaths per year. In an increasingly elderly population, the surgical treatment of CHF made great progress during the past 3 decades, consuming enormous health care resources. Heart transplantation is still the most effective therapy for end-stage heart disease, with the 10-year survival rate after transplantation approaching 50%. Efforts to increase the supply of donor organs have failed to improve the shortage, underscoring the crucial need for alternatives to cardiac allotransplantation. Alternative surgical options to end-stage heart transplantation are rapidly evolving. Left ventricular assist devices have been used as a bridge to heart transplantation for patients who otherwise might die awaiting a new heart. There is also continued interest in the use of these devices either to bridge patients to full recovery or to destination therapy, without the need for heart replacement. Left ventricular reconstruction, including the Batista and Dor procedures, along with mitral valve repair, cardiomyoplasty, and extreme coronary artery bypass graft surgery, are now being increasingly performed as alternative options. The history, status, and personal experience of surgical treatment of end-stage heart disease are discussed.
