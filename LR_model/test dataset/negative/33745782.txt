Effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors in heart transplant patients with type 2 diabetes: Initial report from a cardiometabolic center of excellence. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a common comorbidity among patients who have undergone heart transplantation. Recently two classes of glucose-lowering medications (sodium-glucose cotransporter type-2 inhibitors [SGLT-2Is] and glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonists [GLP-1RAs]), have been shown to significantly improve cardiovascular outcomes. There is a paucity of data regarding their use in immunosuppressed patients, with many studies specifically excluding this population. We retrospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2Is in patients who had undergone orthotopic heart transplant at a high-volume center. Among 21 patients, we found significant weight loss, reductions in insulin use, hemoglobin A1c, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Moreover, both SGLT-2Is and GLP-1RAs were well tolerated with no adverse events leading to discontinuation of either therapy. While larger studies of patients after solid organ transplant are needed, this small hypothesis-generating study demonstrates that SGLT-2Is and GLP-1RAs appear safe and effective therapies among patients with T2D after heart transplant.
