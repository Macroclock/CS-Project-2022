Cardiac sarcoid in a heart transplant recipient: detection with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. We describe the case of a 54-year-old man who presented with cardiac sarcoid 1 month after tapering of corticosteroids and 3 years post-cardiac transplantation. In addition to evidence of noncaseating granulomas on endomyocardial biopsy, a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study showed a typical subepicardial pattern of fibrosis corroborating the pathological diagnosis of sarcoid. This is the first description of cardiac sarcoid developing so late after transplantation. This report suggests that MRI may be an effective noninvasive modality to identify sarcoid in cardiac allografts.
