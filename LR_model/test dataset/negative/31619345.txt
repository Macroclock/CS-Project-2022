Ischemic Cardiomyopathy Due to Localized Takayasu Arteritis Treated by Heart Transplantation Following Left Ventricular Assisted Device Implantation: A Case Report. A 19-year-old Asian woman presented to the emergency department with ventricular fibrillation. Emergent coronary angiography revealed a 99% ostial stenosis of the left main coronary trunk, and percutaneous coronary intervention was performed. Takayasu arteritis was suspected, but fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scanning showed no active inflammation. Cardiac function was affected by ischemic cardiomyopathy, and an extracorporeal left ventricular assisted device was implanted under INTERMACS profile 1 status. Histopathology of the ascending aortic wall at the outflow anastomosis site showed no significant sign of Takayasu arteritis. The absence of systemic inflammation led to the replacement of the extracorporeal left ventricular assisted device with a Jervik 2000 as a bridge to transplant. An orthotropic heart transplant took place after a 39-month wait. Histopathology of the explanted heart revealed intimal and adventitial thickening with destruction of the elastic lamina localized at the sinus of Valsalva. Our final pathologic diagnosis was localized Takayasu arteritis. To counter the increased risk of stenosis or pseudoaneurysm formation at the vascular anastomosis site, anti-inflammatory therapy was essential in Takayasu arteritis. The post-heart transplant immunosuppression regime was considered stronger than that for Takayasu arteritis, and we therefore administered prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus as standard protocol. There have been no signs of either relapse or rejection of transplantation for over 1 year. Further closed observation is required to clarify the long-term outcome of this rare condition with regard to heart transplantation.
