Stimulation of murine P2Y11-like purinoreceptor protects against hypoxia/reoxygenation injury and decreases heart graft rejection lesions. Myocardial ischemia reperfusion is a major cause of cell injury during cardiac transplantation and is responsible for increased graft rejection. Several in vitro studies demonstrated the protective effect of P2Y11-like purinoreceptor stimulation in the context of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. In this study, we hypothesized a possible cardioprotective role of P2Y11R stimulation against ischemia/reperfusion lesions and validated its clinical effect in vivo in a heart transplantation model. We subjected H9c2 rat cardiomyocyte-derived cell line to 5 hours of hypoxia and 1 hour of reoxygenation. P2Y11R selective agonist NF546 and antagonist NF340 were added at the onset of reoxygenation. Cell injuries were assessed by microculture tetrazolium reduction and intracellular adenosine triphosphate level. Clinical effect of P2Y11R stimulation was further investigated in vivo. Hearts from BALB/c mice were transplanted intra-abdominally into allogenic C57BL/6 mice (n = 104). Recipient mice were injected with P2Y11R agonist. Mice in the sham group were injected with saline solution. In the control group, hearts from C57BL/6 were transplanted into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. Rejection lesions were investigated using histology and immunohistochemistry at days 3, 5, and 7 after transplantation. We measured caspase activities to quantify apoptosis. Production of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was investigated. P2Y11R stimulation at the onset of reoxygenation significantly reduced in vitro hypoxia/reoxygenation injuries. This protection was suppressed with P2Y11R antagonist. In vivo, cardiac allograft survival was significantly prolonged after P2Y11R stimulation. Rejection lesions, classified according to the International Society of Heart Lung Transplantation guidelines and quantified using the mean number of inflammatory cells per field, were significantly reduced in the treated group. At day 5 after transplantation, P2Y11R agonist pretreated allografts also demonstrated less apoptotic lesions. Our data suggest a novel cardioprotective role of P2Y11R at the onset of reoxygenation/reperfusion against reperfusion injuries. Pharmacologic conditioning using P2Y11 agonist may be beneficial after cardiac transplantation in improving myocardial ischemia/reperfusion outcomes and decreasing graft rejection lesions.
