Intraoperative and Early Postoperative Management of Heart Transplantation: Anesthetic Implications. The gold standard treatment for end-stage heart failure, with 50% mortality within 5 years of diagnosis, is considered heart transplantation. Despite the improvements in immunosuppression, the period of highest mortality risk in the heart transplantation population is during the first year post-transplantation, with primary graft dysfunction being the leading cause of mortality. After adequate preoperative assessment of the recipient, including patients on mechanical support, the intraoperative care of heart transplantation patients requires extensive monitoring followed by proficient management of anesthesia induction and maintenance, ventilation, and fluid therapy. The focus on weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass should be on preventing right ventricular failure and high pulmonary vascular resistances, with protocolized blood conservation strategies and transfusion protocols. The early postoperative care of a heart transplantation patient is focused on the post-cardiopulmonary bypass and transplantation status, with particular attention to the presence of primary graft dysfunction, right ventricular performance, pulmonary pressures, and vasoplegia. The aim is early extubation, inotropic and chronotropic support weaning, and chest tube removal to facilitate discharge of the patient from the intensive care unit. The increased complexity of heart transplantation recipients, including the incremental use of pre- transplantation mechanical circulatory support and extended criteria donor hearts, requires extensive and sophisticated preparation of the cardiac anesthesiologist. This article aims to provide an overview of the intraoperative and early postoperative anesthesia management of heart transplantation patients.
