Prolonging hypothermic ischaemic cardiac and vascular storage by inhibiting the activation of the nuclear enzyme poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase. Heart transplantation is the standard treatment in end-stage heart failure and at shortage of cardiac allografts is its major limiting factor. Striving to optimize the use of this limited resource, the aspect that long distance procurement may increase the available donor pool must be taken into consideration. As poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP)-activation has been identified as a key pathway of reperfusion injury, we assessed the hypothesis that its inhibition would allow an extension of cold preservation time and protect the graft against ischaemia/reperfusion injury. Hearts from donor rats were explanted, stored in a preservation solution (Custodiol) at 4 °C for 4 h or 8 h, and heterotopically transplanted. A vehicle or the PARP-inhibitor, INO-1001 (5 mg/kg), was administered during the reperfusion period. We evaluated post-transplant graft function with a Millar micromanometer at different left-ventricular volumes. Additionally, in organ bath experiments the effect of PARP-inhibition on endothelium-dependent and -independent vasorelaxation was evaluated after long-term cold ischaemic storage/warm reperfusion. PARP-inhibition resulted in a better systolic functional recovery of grafts submitted to 4 h and 8 h ischaemia. Furthermore, INO-1001 decreased the left-ventricular end-diastolic pressure after 8 h of ischaemia. Coronary blood flow was significantly higher after PARP-inhibition in comparison to controls. Endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was significantly better in the INO-1001-groups than in the vehicle-treated transplant groups. After 24-h hypothermic storage, treatment of aortic ring with INO-1001 during reoxygenation significantly improved endothelial dysfunction. By inhibiting the PARP activation, INO-1001 can protect the graft and endothelium from the injury that is caused by prolonged cold myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion, thereby improving post-transplant graft function.
