Alemtuzumab Induction Versus Conventional Immunosuppression in Heart Transplant Recipients. The use of alemtuzumab for induction therapy in orthotopic heart transplantation remains controversial, despite its observed benefits in other transplant populations. This study aimed to evaluate whether alemtuzumab conferred a lower risk of rejection while reducing toxicities commonly attributed to standard immunosuppression in orthotopic heart transplantation. We included adult patients who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation and received induction therapy with alemtuzumab (n = 26) or standard immunosuppression (n = 26). The primary end point was freedom from grade â‰¥2 rejection at 12 months. Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups with the exception of poorer renal function in the alemtuzumab group ( 'alemtuzumab', 'heart transplant', 'immunosuppression', 'induction', 'rejection'
