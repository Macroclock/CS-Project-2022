CTLA4-Fas ligand gene transfer mediated by adenovirus induce long-time survival of murine cardiac allografts. Fas ligand gene transfer to induce peripheral allograft tolerance in animal models has shown controversial results. The immunosuppression effects mediated by engineered FasL depend on whether alloreactive T cells are selectively deleted. In the present study, we tested the feasibility of a strategy to induce long-time survival by fusing CTLA4-FasL gene transfer in vivo. Cardiac allografts from DA(RT-1(a)) rats were transplanted heterotopically into the abdomens of LEW(RT-1(1)) rats. Plaque units (5x10(9)) of either AdCTLA4-FasL, AdCTLA4Ig, or AdEGFP were administered via the portal vein immediately after cardiac transplantation. The frequencies of helper T lymphocyte precursors (HTLp) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors (CTLp) were determined by a combined single limiting dilution assay on days 5 and 20 after transplantation. Cardiac allograft survival was significantly prolonged by either AdCTLA4-FasL or AdCTLA4Ig treatment(mean survival times [MST] of 71.0 +/- 3.7 and 45.7 +/- 2.4, respectively, n = 6) compared with untreated hosts or animals treated with AdEGFP(MST of 5.7 +/- 0.5 and 5.2 +/- 0.4, respectively, n = 6). In addition, treatment with AdCTLA4-FasL led to significantly prolonged allograft survival compared with AdCTLA4Ig treatment. Furthermore, the frequencies of HTLp and CTLp on day 20 among rats treated with AdCTLA4-FasL was lower than those on day 5, whereas frequencies of HTLp and CTLp on day 20 were similar with those on day 5 in the other groups. These results suggest that administration of an adenovirus encoding fusion CTLA4-FasL gene to rat recipients effectively decreased the size of alloreactive T cells and induced long-term survival of cardiac allografts.
