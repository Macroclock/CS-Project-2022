Satisfaction with heart transplantation. This research investigated patient satisfaction with heart transplantation (HT) 6 months after surgery. The authors explored whether HT patients would make the decision to have HT again and examined medical, psychosocial, and demographic factors associated with satisfaction or dissatisfaction in 257 HT recipients. Nonparametric statistics were used. Satisfaction with HT could be rated from 1 (not satisfied) to 10 (very satisfied). Eighty-seven percent of the patients were highly satisfied with HT 6 months after surgery (ratings of 8-10); 1% rated their satisfaction as low (1-3), and 12% rated it as moderate (4-7). Factors associated with less satisfaction with HT were: more symptom distress, greater disability, more stress, poor coping ability, feeling that the interventions of the HT team were not very helpful, less life satisfaction, and lower quality of life. Ninety-three percent indicated that they either definitely or probably would decide to have HT again; 7% responded "probably not" or "not sure." Factors associated with a negative perception of having another HT were: poor coping ability, less life satisfaction, lower quality of life, being male, and being married.
