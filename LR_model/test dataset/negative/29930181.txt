Heart transplant recipient with mycophenolate mofetil-induced colitis: the great imitator. In this article, we report a case of a 55-year-old male heart transplant recipient who presented with diarrhoea. An extensive workup for infectious diseases was negative. The patient had a colonoscopy with biopsies showing colitis that mimicked graft-versus-host disease on histopathology. After excluding other potential causes and excluding acute cellular rejection, mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued, and the patient had significant clinical improvement with increased appetite and weight gain.
