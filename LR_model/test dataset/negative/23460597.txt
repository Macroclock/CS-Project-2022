Transapical transcatheter aortic valve implantation in a heart transplant recipient with severely depressed left ventricular function. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is becoming a valuable alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement in non-operable and high-risk surgical patients. As the population of heart donors and recipients ages, the prevalence of degenerative valvular disease after transplantation will increase. The optimal treatment strategy of valvulopathies in these patients with extensive comorbidity is still unknown because of insufficient published experience. We present a heart transplant recipient with renal failure, systolic heart failure and severe aortic stenosis who was successfully treated with transapical TAVI.
