Reactive hemophagocytic syndrome associated with disseminated histoplasmosis in a heart transplant recipient. We describe a patient who developed multi-organ failure with reactive hemophagocytic syndrome secondary to disseminated histoplasmosis 8 months after orthotopic heart transplantation. The patient responded fully to a prolonged course of therapy with amphotericin B and remains free of recurrence. Disseminated histoplasmosis and reactive hemophagocytic syndrome have rarely been described in the setting of cardiac transplantation and never before in combination.
