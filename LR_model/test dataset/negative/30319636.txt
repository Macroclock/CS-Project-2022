Early Everolimus Initiation Fails to Counteract the Cytotoxic Response Mediated by CD8 The positive long-term effects of conversion to everolimus (EVL) after heart transplantation (HT) have been evaluated in several studies. However, the timing of EVL initiation, the best way to combine it with other immunosuppressive treatments, and the impact of these combinations on the immune response are poorly understood aspects. Here, we analyzed the immune phenotype and function of HT patients ( 'CD8+ T cells', 'DNA methylation', 'NK cells', 'cytotoxicity', 'everolimus', 'heart transplantation', 'mTOR inhibitors'
