Heart transplantation after Fontan: Results from a surgical Fontan cohort. We performed a retrospective review of outcomes after heart transplantation during long-term follow-up of a surgical cohort of 1138 Fontan patients who were followed at the Mayo Clinic. Follow-up information was obtained from medical records and a clinical questionnaire that was mailed to patients not known to be deceased at the initiation of the study. Forty-four of 1138 Fontan patients with initial or subsequent evaluation at Mayo had cardiac transplantation between 1988 and 2014 (mean age at transplantation was 23.2 ± 12 yr, median was 19.8 yr; mean interval between Fontan and transplantation was 13.0 ± 7.7 yr, median was 13.1 yr). Two patients had combined organ transplantation (one heart-lung, one heart-liver). Twelve of the 44 (27%) patients had PLE prior to transplantation. There was no difference in post-bypass Fontan pressures or incidence of late reoperations for AVV repair/replacement between transplanted and non-transplanted patients. There were 16 (36%) deaths in the transplantation cohort; seven occurred within 30 days of transplantation. Overall one, five, 10, and 15 yr post-transplantation survival was 80%, 72%, 69%, and 55%, respectively. Although this is a challenging group of patients, intermediate-term results suggest that cardiac transplantation remains a reasonable option for patients with a failed Fontan circulation.
