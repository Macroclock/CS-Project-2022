Early Postoperative Aortic Root Thrombus After Heartmate 3. As a bridge to heart transplantation or destination treatment, implantation of the Heartmate 3 (HM3) left ventricular assist device is a viable option for patients with end-stage congestive heart failure. The recent Momentum 3 trial has shown favorable outcomes compared with Heartmate 2. We report the first case of aortic root thrombus occurring early after HM3 implantation as a bridge to heart transplantation. Our case suggests that bridging with an Impella 5.0 preceding HM3 implantation could potentially predispose patients to aortic root thrombus after HM3 implantation, due to Impella-related injury to the aortic valve and aortic root stasis after durable LVAD support.
