Early postoperative hemodynamic instability after heart transplantation - incidence and metabolic indicators. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is the main cause of death in the first 30 days after heart transplantation (HTX), accounting for approximately 40% of mortality. The study's primary aim was to assess the incidence of PGD, following the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation consensus, and to compare it with the incidence of significant postoperative hypotension despite administration of high-dose inotropes and vasoconstrictors. The secondary aim of the study was to determine changes in biochemical markers that accompany the phenomenon. Forty-five patients who underwent HTX between 2010 and 2015 were enrolled in this study, and detailed hemodynamic and metabolic data from the first 48 postoperative hours were collected and analyzed. Hemodynamic instability was defined as significant postoperative hypotension (mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 60 mmHg) combined with a high inotrope score (> 10). Data for long-term mortality were obtained from the population registration office. PGD incidence was relatively low (17.8%); however, hemodynamic instability was common (40%). Among unstable patients, MAP was insufficient for end-organ perfusion (51.4 ± 9.5 mmHg) but no decrease in left ventricular function was observed (cardiac index, 2.65 ± 0.6 l/min/m2; left ventricular ejection fraction, 52.9 ± 15.5%). Within this group, mean systemic vascular resistance index (961 ± 288 dyn*s*m2/cm5) was low despite receiving high doses of vasoactive agent (norepinephrine 0.21 (0.06-0.27) μg/kg/min during first 24 h postoperatively and 0.21 (0.01-0.27) μg/kg/min during next 24 h postoperatively). After HTX, serum lactate levels were initially significantly higher in patients with hemodynamic instability (p = 0.002); however, impaired lactate clearance was not observed (p = 0.366), and lactate levels normalized within the first 24 h postoperatively. Postoperative hemodynamic instability altered the long-term outcome and increased 5-year mortality after HTX (p = 0.034). Hemodynamic instability is a more common phenomenon than PGD. Only early postoperative serum lactate levels correspond with hemodynamic instability following HTX. Postoperative hemodynamic instability is associated with poor long-term survival among HTX recipients.
