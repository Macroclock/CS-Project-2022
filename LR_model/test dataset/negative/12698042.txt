Early detection of cardiac disease masquerading as acute bronchospasm: The role of bedside limited echocardiography by the emergency physician. We report two cases in which the patients experienced dyspnea, cough, and acute bronchospasm. Pulmonary pathology was initially suspected. Failure to respond to an initial trial of inhaled bronchodilator prompted the use of bedside limited echocardiography by the emergency physician. The potential role of limited echocardiography by the emergency physician as a triage tool in facilitating early diagnosis and emergent therapy, reducing time to final discharge, and enhancing interaction between the pediatric emergency physician and cardiology consultants is highlighted.
