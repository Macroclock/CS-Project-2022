Primary cutaneous CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma in a heart transplant patient: case report and literature review. Solid organ transplant recipients are at risk of developing a wide range of viral-associated malignancies, including skin tumours and lymphoproliferative disorders. The risk of a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder is 28-49 times the risk of a lymphoproliferative disorder in the normal population. Most cases are of B-cell phenotype and are associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders presenting clinically in the skin are rare and usually of B-cell phenotype. Only rare cases of cutaneous T-cell post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder have been reported previously, mostly mycosis fungoides type. We describe here a rare primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma CD30+ arising in a heart transplant patient who had a nodule on the right leg, several years after heart transplantation. The morphology and immunohistochemical findings were consistent with a CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma with a T-cell phenotype. Excisional biopsy and radiotherapy of the affected area were performed. In this patient, the presence of a solitary lesion and the lack of systemic involvement represented the main factors taken into account in choosing the therapy and the patient was therefore treated using a non-aggressive approach, although with systemic immunosuppression. In conclusion, the diagnosis of a CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma in transplant recipients does not imply aggressive clinical behaviour by the lymphoma.
