Bone loss after heart transplant: effect of alendronate, etidronate, calcitonin, and calcium plus vitamin D3. To compare the effects of calcitonin, etidronate, and alendronate in preventing bone loss during the first 2 years after heart transplant. A total of 222 heart transplant recipients (mean [SD] age, 52.4 [10] years, 85% male) were evaluated. Patients with normal bone mineral density (reference group, n = 102) received 1000 mg/d calcium plus 800 IU/d vitamin D3. The rest were assigned to 200 IU/d of calcitonin (n=42), 400 mg/d etidronate orally for 14 days quarterly (n = 33), or 10 mg/d alendronate (n = 45). All patients received calcium and vitamin D. Bone mineral density was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in the lumbar spine, the entire femur, and the femoral neck at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months after transplant. At 2 years after transplant, bone mineral density in the lumbar spine had decreased in the reference group (-3.07%), calcitonin group (-0.93%), and etidronate group (-1.87%) but not in the alendronate group (+4.9%; P <.001). After 2 years, bone mineral density in the entire femur decreased in all groups (-3.2% in the reference group, -3.6% in the calcitonin group, -4.6% in the etidronate group, and -0.5% in the alendronate group) but bone loss was significantly lower in the alendronate group (P <.001). Bone mineral density in the femoral neck also decreased in all groups. The incidence of vertebral fractures did not differ among groups. Adverse events were similar between groups. Alendronate therapy in heart transplant recipients was associated with a significant increase in bone mineral density in the lumbar spine and less bone loss at the hip.
