Changes in blood concentration of mycophenolic acid and FK506 in a heart-transplant patient treated with plasmapheresis . Prior to heart transplant, sensitization to human leukocyte antigen can occur after blood transfusions used during implantation of ventricular assist devices. The result is an increased risk of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) after heart transplant. While plasmapheresis (PPH) treats serious AMR cases, what subsequent changes occur in the blood concentrations of immunosuppressive agents is still unknown. We investigated pre- and post-PPH changes in blood concentrations of tacrolimus (FK506) and mycophenolic acid (MPA) in a heart-transplant patient experiencing AMR. A 40-year-old woman with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy had heart transplantation for advanced heart failure. Since the patient was donor-specific antibody-positive and at risk for AMR, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and PPH were performed just before transplantation. Triple combination immunosuppressive therapy was initiated, but 4 days after transplantation, panel-reactive antibody increased drastically, and AMR was diagnosed by biopsy. Multidisciplinary therapy, including PPH, was performed. Blood samples were collected to measure blood concentrations of FK506 and MPA before and after passage through the plasma separator. The elimination efficiency of FK506 from PPH was -6.25 - 2.25%, while the elimination efficiency of MPA was much greater at 32.35 - 51.43%. These results show the necessity of carefully considering changes in blood concentrations that occur in immunosuppressive agents due to PPH, including the pharmacokinetics of the particular drug. However, proper timing of the PPH relative to drug administration can also minimize immunosuppressant loss. .
