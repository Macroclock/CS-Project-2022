Follow-up examination of 12 heart transplant recipients with cardiac CT. The aims of this study were to observe the changes of a transplanted heart with cardiac computed tomography (CT) and to evaluate the clinical application of the examination. Cardiac CT was performed on 12 heart transplant recipients, of which 4 cases were also examined by echocardiography. Coronary arteries, the cardiac chamber, and the wall were shown with three-dimensional imaging techniques, and their changes were analyzed and discussed. Twelve heart transplant recipients were successfully examined by CT. All transplanted hearts were found with good anastomosis at the great vessels and atria. Coronary allograft vasculopathy was found in 7 cases, of which 4 cases were found with ventricular dilation or ventricular septum thickening and 1 with tricuspid regurgitation. Ventricular dilation was found in other 3 cases, of which 1 was found with ventricular septum thickening and 1 with tricuspid regurgitation. No abnormality was found by cardiac CT in the rest 2 cases, which were found with mitral regurgitation by echocardiography. Cardiac CT can clearly and directly display the changes in the shape of a transplanted heart and coronary artery abnormalities. It will become an ideal noninvasive follow-up method for the heart transplant recipients.
