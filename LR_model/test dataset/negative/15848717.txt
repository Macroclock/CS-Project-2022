Early and late rejection and HLA sensitization at the time of heart transplantation in patients bridged with left ventricular assist devices. Over the years, the frequency of heart transplant candidates with HLA sensitization has increased as a result of the number of patients bridged to transplant using left ventricular assist devices (LVAD). Here we have examined 119 patients who were bridged to transplant with LVAD for a relationship between HLA antibodies and early (30 days) and late (2 years or more) rejection, as evidenced by endomyocardial biopsies. Both cytotoxic panel-reactive antibody reactions against a panel of T lymphocytes (T-PRA) and the percentage of transplants that occurred across a positive class I flow cross-match were examined. Biopsies were scored using ISHLT criteria. At 30 days, patients who had a biopsy grade of 0 had a mean T-PRA at transplant of 2.2%, while the mean PRAs of the other biopsy grades were significantly higher (P < .001). A similar pattern was seen with the highest biopsy results at 2 years or later (P < .001). None of the patients who had a grade 0 biopsy at 30 days posttransplant had a positive flow cytometry class I cross-match (P = .02), although the same pattern did not occur later due to a small number of patients (n = 3) who had negative biopsies. Thus, when biopsy results were examined early or late posttransplant, patients with negative biopsy results tended to have less HLA sensitization. While the methods of HLA sensitization involve humoral responses, more aggressive immunosuppression might be warranted to attempt to reduce cellular rejection posttransplant if HLA class I antibodies are present at the time of transplant.
