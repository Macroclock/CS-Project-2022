Permanent acceptance of both cardiac and skin allografts using a mild conditioning regimen for the induction of stable mixed chimerism in mice. Patients who are receiving an organ transplant nowadays are sentenced to the life-long administration of immunosuppressive drugs, which have serious side effects. The reliable induction of donor-specific tolerance therefore remains a major goal in organ transplantation. Previously, we have developed a sublethal, non-myeloablative murine model in which permanent mixed, multilineage chimerism and donor-specific tolerance are established. Our model involves engraftment of fully allogeneic T cell depleted donor bone marrow cells in low dose irradiated and anti-CD3 treated major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-disparate recipient mice. To investigate whether vascularized organ grafts are accepted in our model, we performed heterotopic heart transplantations in our mixed chimeric mice. Chimeric mice permanently accepted hearts from the bone marrow donor (>130 days) and rapidly rejected third party-type allografts (median survival time 9 days). Untreated control recipient mice rejected both donor- and third party-type allografts. In addition, mice that accepted their cardiac grafts, donor-specific acceptance of skin grafts was observed. In conclusion, the establishment of stable mixed chimerism with this low-toxicity regimen resulted in permanent donor-specific acceptance of vascularized organ as well as skin grafts across a full MHC barrier.
