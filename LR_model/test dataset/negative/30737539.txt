Coexistence an aberrant right subclavian artery with other congenital anomalies: case report and review of the literature. Aberrant right subclavian artery is the most common aortic arch anomaly that frequently occurs in coexistence with other congenital cardiovascular anomalies. A 32-year-old male patient was hospitalized with ventricular septal defect, chronic heart failure NYHA class III, pulmonary arterial hypertension. Contrast-enhanced multislice computed tomography revealed membranous ventricular septal defect, persistent left superior vena cava, bicuspid aortic valve and aberrant right subclavian artery. Aberrant right subclavian artery was clinically silent and discovered accidentally. The patient underwent heart-lung transplantation due to pronounced, irreversible pulmonary hypertension. This article reports a rare coexistence of aberrant right subclavian artery with other congenital anomalies of the heart and great vessels in living men.
