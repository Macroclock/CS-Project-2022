How to remove the retroauricular driveline in the Jarvik 2000 after heart transplantation. The Jarvik 2000 is a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) used as either a bridge-to-transplant or destination therapy with the possibility of retroauricular percutaneous power delivery (pedestal). Percutaneous driveline infection in LVAD is a life-threatening complication that affects both the quality and length of life in patients. With its rigid fixation to the bone, the pedestal and the vascularity of scalp skin promote healing and reduce the risk of driveline infection. We describe a technique to remove the skull-mounted percutaneous pedestal of the Jarvik 2000 after heart transplantation.
