Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate Solution for Donor Heart Preservation Is Safe for Transplantation. Various solutions are used for donor heart preservation. We examined the outcomes in our heart transplant population where histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution has been used for heart preservation since 2004. This was a retrospective review of the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database (2004-2016) comparing our heart transplant outcomes with other national centers. Propensity matching in a 1:3 ratio was performed to adjust for preoperative recipient variables. After propensity matching comparing UNOS outcomes (n = 1080) with our institutional data (n = 360), there was no difference in matched preoperative variables. Donor hearts were similar for donor age, sex, donor-to-recipient size ratio, LVEF, and ischemic time. Our HTK cohort had a larger proportion with donor cardiac arrest (26.3% vs 6.1%, P < .001) and longer cardiac arrest duration (22.1 ± 16.0 vs 17.2 ± 14.0 minutes, P = .052). Our primary graft dysfunction (PGD) rate requiring mechanical support was 4.2% (n = 1). Postoperative mechanical support use for PGD included extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 9 (60.0%), intraaortic balloon pump in 4 (26.7%), right ventricular assist device in 3 (20%), and biventricular assist device in 3 (20%). Overall survival at our institution was similar to the national average (P = .649). Survival at 1, 5, and 10 years with HTK was 92.2%, 81.3%, and 70.8%, and for the UNOS population was 91.6%, 80.3%, and 62.0%, respectively. Use of HTK solution for donor hearts was associated with a low rate of severe PGD. Overall survival was not significantly different from other institutions using a variety of preservation solutions in the UNOS database during the same period. HTK solution is efficacious for preservation of donor hearts.
