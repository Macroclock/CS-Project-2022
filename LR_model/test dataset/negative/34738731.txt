Engineered Small Extracellular Vesicles as a FGL1/PD-L1 Dual-Targeting Delivery System for Alleviating Immune Rejection. There is an urgent need for developing new immunosuppressive agents due to the toxicity of long-term use of broad immunosuppressive agents after organ transplantation. Comprehensive sample analysis revealed dysregulation of FGL1/LAG-3 and PD-L1/PD-1 immune checkpoints in allogeneic heart transplantation mice and clinical kidney transplant patients. In order to enhance these two immunosuppressive signal axes, a bioengineering strategy is developed to simultaneously display FGL1/PD-L1 (FP) on the surface of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). Among various cell sources, FP sEVs derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) not only enriches FGL1/PD-L1 expression but also maintain the immunomodulatory properties of unmodified MSC sEVs. Next, it is confirmed that FGL1 and PD-L1 on sEVs are specifically bound to their receptors, LAG-3 and PD-1 on target cells. Importantly, FP sEVs significantly inhibite T cell activation and proliferation in vitro and a heart allograft model. Furthermore, FP sEVs encapsulated with low-dose FK506 (FP sEVs@FK506) exert stronger effects on inhibiting T cell proliferation, reducing CD8 'FGL1', 'Immunological rejection', 'Immunosuppressant', 'PD-L1', 'Small extracellular vesicles'
