Multi organ transplantation: a review of the Irish experience. As the criteria for organ transplantation have broadened, multi organ transplantation has become more common. Calcineurin inhibitor induced end stage renal failure is a common indication for kidney transplantation. We present our experience of 12 kidney transplants, in 11 patients, over a period of 9 years all in the setting of multi-organ transplantation. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were applied. Estimated patient survival at 1, 3 and 5 years post transplant was 100%, 83% and 66% respectively. Estimated graft survival at 1, 3 and 5 years was 90%, 79% and 63% respectively. The estimated median renal graft survival was 6.2 years. Calcineurin inhibitor toxicity was the most common cause of end stage renal failure in this series of patients. There is a very fine balance between ideal immunosuppression for kidney and other organ transplants. Patients who avoid morbidity such as sepsis or graft rejection enjoy good graft function at 5 years post transplant.
