Na+/H+ exchange inhibition and antioxidants lack additive protective effects after reperfusion injury in the working heterotopic rat heart isograft. The utility of combining strategies of myocardial protection was studied in intact rat hearts subjected to 1 hour of ischemia and 40 minutes blood reperfusion. Lewis rats (n = 48) were divided into 4 transplant groups. Twenty-four hearts were arrested by coronary perfusion with hypothermic Celsior solution at 60 mm Hg. The aortic valve was punctured to introduce volume into the left ventricle (LV), and the hearts were abdominally isografted. Animals were either given both the antioxidant probucol (300 mg/kg) and the sodium-hydrogen exchange inhibitor cariporide (5 mg/kg) (CP; n = 6), just cariporide (CAR; n = 6), just probucol (PROB; n = 6), or neither drug (CON; n = 6). After 40 minutes of blood reperfusion, transplanted hearts were rearrested. The control recipients' native hearts (native; n = 6) were also arrested. Postmortem LV compliance relations and myocardial water content (MWC) were measured. Grafts protected by probucol were significantly more compliant than controls and significantly less compliant than grafts protected by cariporide alone and with both cariporide and probucol (p = 0.0001, analysis of variance). Compliance relations for CP overlapped those for CAR. All grafts were less compliant than natives. MWC was significantly greater in controls and PROB than in natives. Pretreatment with cariporide in the setting of ischemia-reperfusion injury provides greater protection against the development of diastolic abnormalities than probucol when Celsior solution is used for both arrest and preservation. In this model, there is no advantage to combining the drugs, supporting the hypothesis that there is an overlapping mechanism of protection.
