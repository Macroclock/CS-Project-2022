Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Applications in Cardiac Critical Care. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy (ECMO) in cardiac critical care has steadily increased over the past decade. Significant improvements in the technology associated with ECMO have propagated this recent resurgence and contributed to improved patient outcomes in the fields of cardiac and transplant (heart and lung) surgery. Specifically, ECMO is being increasingly utilized as a bridge to heart and lung transplantation, as well as to ventricular assist device placement. ECMO is also employed during the administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, known as extracorporeal life support. In this review, we examine the recent literature regarding the applications of ECMO and also describe emerging topics involving current ECMO management strategies.
