Reduction of chronic graft injury with a new HTK-based preservation solution in a murine heart transplantation model. Aim of this study was to evaluate a new histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK)-based preservation solution on chronic isograft injury in comparison to traditional HTK solution. Hearts of C57BL/6J (H-2b) mice were stored for 15 h in 0-4 °C cold preservation solution and then transplanted heterotopically into C57BL/6J (H-2b) mice. Three groups were evaluated: HTK, the base solution of a new preservation solution and hearts without cold ischemia (control). Time to restoration of heartbeat was measured (re-beating time). Strength of the heartbeat was palpated daily and scored on a 4-level scale (palpation score). Animals were sacrificed after 60 days of observation (24 h for TGF-β expression). The transplanted hearts were evaluated histologically for myocardial damage, vasculopathy and interstitial fibrosis. TGF-β expression was assessed immunohistologically. All investigators were blinded to the groups. ANOVA and LSD post hoc test were used for statistical analysis. The re-beating time was significantly shorter in hearts stored in the new solution (10.3±2.6 min vs. HTK 14.2±4.1 min; p<0.05). The palpation score was significantly higher in hearts stored in the new solution (2.3±0.4 vs. HTK 1.6±0.5; p<0.01). Hearts stored in the new solution showed a lower myocardial injury score (1.8±0.2 vs. HTK 2.2±0.7), less interstitial fibrosis (4.8±1.9% vs. HTK 8.5±3.8%, p<0.05), less vasculopathy (14.7±6.9% vs. 22.0±23.2%; p=0.06) and lower TGF-β1-expression (6.6±1.4% vs. HTK 12.0±4.6%). The new HTK-based solution reduces the chronic isograft injury. This protective effect is likely achieved through several modifications and supplements into the new solution like N-acetyl-L-histidine, glycine, alanine, arginine and sucrose.
