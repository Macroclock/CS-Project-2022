Optimizing Surgical Skills in Cardiac Surgery Residents with Cardiac Transplant in the High-Fidelity Porcine Model. Simulation is a pivotal tool within cardiac surgery to facilitate learner growth and skill acquisition. There are many methods of simulation and it is possible to develop and implement new curricula incorporating these modalities. The objective of this paper is to describe the feasibility of a high-fidelity cardiac transplant simulation curriculum for surgical residents. Our simulation setting was the Animal Resource Center at the University of Calgary. It was set up with 4 separate operating rooms, 2 for donor heart retrievals and 2 for heart implantations. This was done to allow 2 learners to participate with each animal, replicating the true intraoperative environment. Our teaching sessions were facilitated by 2 surgeons experienced in cardiac transplantation. In addition, we had support staff including multiple perfusionists, nurses, and anesthesia technologists. The curriculum was evaluated from many perspectives in real time throughout the simulation as well as afterward in posttest qualitative interviews with all participants. The residents readily identified the acquisition of and increased proficiency in specifically targeted surgical skills. In addition, the residents were able to practice communication, collaboration, and management. Furthermore, the simulation session and our debriefings contributed significantly to fostering a team approach. The pig is an excellent preclinical model for acquiring and developing the skills necessary for human cardiac transplantation. The residents partaking in the curriculum were satisfied with the learning they received and saw value in the swine transplant curriculum. The overall curriculum was cost-effective, due to the low overall operating costs associated with it. 'cardiac transplantation', 'education', 'high fidelity', 'simulation'
