Analysis of correlations between N‑terminal pro‑B‑type natriuretic peptide levels and markers of venous pulmonary hypertension in patients referred for heart transplantation.  Heart failure (HF) is a growing health care problem in the world. Secondary pulmonary venous hypertension is usually observed in patients with end‑stage heart failure.  The main purpose of the study was to evaluate the relationships between N‑terminal pro‑B‑type natriuretic peptide (NT‑proBNP) levels and the markers of secondary venous pulmonary   hypertension in patients referred for heart transplantation (HTX).   This retrospective analysis included 35 patients (32 men, 3 women; median age, 55.0; interquartile range [IQR] 12.0 years). The study group consisted of all consecutive patients referred for HTX, in whom the right‑heart catheterization using the Swan‑Ganz catheter was performed at the same time as the measurement of NT‑proBNP levels.  A high median value of NT‑proBNP (3187.0; IQR 2964.0 pg/ml) and elevated pulmonary pressure were observed in the study group. There was a significant correlation between NT‑proBNP levels and the values of systolic, mean, and diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (r = 0.5, P = 0.001; r = 0.5, P = 0.001; r = 0.5, P = 0.002; respectively) as well as cardiac output (r = -0.4, P = 0.007). There was also a positive correlation between pulmonary artery resistance and NT‑proBNP levels (r = 0.5, P = 0.006).  In our study population, the median value of NT‑proBNP levels exceeded the normal range 25 times. There was a correlation between the markers of secondary pulmonary hypertension and   cardiac output and NT‑proBNP levels. Elevated NT‑proBNP levels in patients with end‑stage HF may be associated with significant secondary venous pulmonary hypertension.
