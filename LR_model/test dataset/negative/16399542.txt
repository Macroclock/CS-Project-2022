An unusual indication for cardiac transplantation: isolated myocardial tuberculosis. We report a case of myocardial tuberculosis in an 18-year-old male. He had been diagnosed with isolated asymmetrical septal hypertrophy cardiomyopathy and presented severe congestive heart failure for 4 months. Echocardiography and magnetic resonance studies showed localized echodense shadows and cavities in the thickness of the left ventricle myocardium with severe myocardial dysfunction. No contraindications for cardiac transplantation were found and this was planned and performed. Histology of the myocardium was consistent with the diagnosis of myocardial tuberculosis. The patient's post-operative course was uneventful, and he was discharged with anti-tuberculosis medication.
