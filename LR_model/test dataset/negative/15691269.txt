Determinants of B-type natriuretic peptide plasma levels in the chronic phase after heart transplantation. Determinants of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) plasma levels in the chronic phase after heart transplantation remain unclear. BNP was measured in 105 stable long-term heart transplant recipients with normal left ventricular function by echocardiography and correlated with clinical, demographic and hemodynamic parameters. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant correlation of BNP with female recipient gender (P = 0.006), time post-transplant (P =0.006), donor age (P = 0.007), angiographic signs of transplant vasculopathy (TVP) (P = 0.03), serum creatinine level (P = 0.04), and a strong trend for diastolic dysfunction (P = 0.09). Donor gender, recipient age, cyclosporin A blood levels, rejection history, and pulmonary artery pressure had no independent effect on BNP. BNP after heart transplantation appears to be influenced both by established general determinants (female gender, renal function) and transplant-specific determinants such as time post-transplant, donor age and potentially also TVP. In order to determine the value of BNP as a potential surrogate marker of TVP serial intraindividual measurements appear appropriate.
