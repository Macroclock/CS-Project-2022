Differences in outcomes for hospitalizations of systemic and non-systemic infections associated with vascular and cardiac grafts and devices: a population-based study. Use of vascular and cardiac devices has expanded and is associated with a relative, though disproportionate, increase in device-associated infections. To describe the association between cardiac/vascular device infections and outcomes in those with, and without systemic infections. We used the 2016 National Inpatient Sample and the International Classification of Diseases - 10 There were a total of 65,110 hospitalizations associated with device infections with a mean age of 61.3 Â± 15.9 years (standard deviation); 28,650 (44%) had systemic infections. Elixhauser comorbidity scores of three or greater were observed in 91.2% of individuals with systemic infections along with a higher prevalence of diabetes, renal disease and heart failure. The primary outcome of mortality was observed in 3965 individuals with an odds ratio of 3.97 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.92-3.95) in those with systemic infections compared with those without. Mean LOS was 3.44 days longer (95% CI, 2.92-3.95) and mean cost was US$11,776 greater (95% CI, US$9826-12,727) in the systemic infection cohort. Systemic cardiac and vascular device infections were associated with increased mortality, LOS and costs. Considering the increasing use of these life-saving devices, further work is needed to identify those at risk for infectious complications, particularly systemic infection, in order to enhance preventative strategies and improve health outcomes.
