A modified CZ-1 preserving solution for organ transplantation: comparative study with UW preserving solution. The University of Wisconsin colloid based preserving solution (UW solution) is the most efficient preserving solution for multiorgan transplantation. Unfortunately, unavailability of delayed organ preserving solutions hindered further progression of cardinal organ transplantation in China. In this study, we validated an organ preserving Changzheng Organ Preserving Solution (CZ-1 solution) and compared it with UW solution. A series of studies were conducted on how and how long CZ-1 solution could preserve the kidneys, livers, hearts, lungs and pancreas of New Zealand rabbits and SD rats. Morphology of transplanted organs was studied by visible microscopy and electron microscopy; biochemical and physiological functions and the survival rate of the organs during prolonged cold storage were studied. There was no significant difference between CZ-1 and UW solutions in preserving the kidneys, livers, hearts or lungs of rabbits; kidneys, livers, intestinal mucosa or pancreases of SD rats or five deceased donors' testicles. In some aspects, such as preserving rabbits' hearts, rats' intestinal mucosa and pancreases, the effect of CZ-1 solution was superior to UW solution. CZ-1 could safely preserve kidneys for 72 hours, livers for 24 hours, hearts for 18 hours and lungs for 8 hours for SD rats. Twelve kidneys preserved in cold CZ-1 solution for 22 - 31 hours were transplanted successfully and the mean renal function recovery time was (3.83 +/- 1.68) days. CZ-1 solution is as effective as UW solution for organ preservation. The development of CZ-1 solution not only reduces costs and improves preservation of organs, but also promotes future development of organ transplantation in China.
