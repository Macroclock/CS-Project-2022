Assessment of sympathetic reinnervation after cardiac transplantation using hybrid cardiac PET/MRI: A pilot study. Sympathetic reinnervation after heart transplantation (HTX) is a known phenomenon, which has an impact on patient heart rate variability and exercise capacity. The impact of reinnervation on myocardial structure has not been evaluated yet. To evaluate the feasibility of simultaneous imaging of cardiac reinnervation and cardiac structure using a hybrid PET/MRI system. Prospective / pilot study. Ten patients, 4-21 years after cardiac transplantation. 3 T hybrid PET/MRI system. Cine SSFP, T All MRI and PET parameters were evaluated by experienced readers using dedicated postprocessing software packages for cardiac MRI and PET. For all parameters a 16-segment model for the left ventricle was applied. Mann-Whitney U-test; Spearman correlations. Thirty-six of 160 myocardial segments showed evidence of reinnervation by PET. On a segment-based analysis, mean native T The assessment of cardiac reinnervation using a hybrid PET/MRI system is feasible. Segments with evidence of reinnervation by PET showed nonsignificantly higher T 3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 3 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2019;50:1326-1335.
