Serum biomarkers of acute rejection: Towards precision medicine in heart transplant. Despite the important changes in the management of heart transplantation in the recent decades, the use of endomyocardial biopsy is still necessary for the follow-up of these patients. However, this technique has several limitations, the most important being the substantial interobserver variability. In the last years multiple attempts have been made to find non-invasive assays for cardiac allograft surveillance, such as imaging modalities and serum biomarkers. This state-of-the-art review focuses on describing the different serum biomarkers that have been proposed for non-invasive diagnosis of acute rejection and that are paving the way towards precision medicine in the field of heart transplantation.
