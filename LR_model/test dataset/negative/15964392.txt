The frequency of interleukin-10- and interleukin-5-secreting CD4+ T cells correlates to tolerance of transplanted lung. Posttransplant bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) results from a chronic immunological/inflammatory insult that leads to fibro-obliteration of the lumen of the allograft airways. The functional T-cell response that is associated with graft acceptance needs to be further clarified in humans. The aim of the present study was to assess the functional activity of peripheral CD4+ T lymphocytes in nine lung transplant recipients with BOS stage II or III (mean 5.4 years after transplant), in seven lung patients with stable clinical conditions (3.4 years posttransplant); and in six normal controls. Peripheral CD4+ T cells, obtained by magnetic bead vs negative purification, were studied using a computer-assisted enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) to assess the number of IFN-gamma-, interleukin (IL)5-, and IL10-gamma-producing cells (no./10(6) CD4+ cells) after allogeneic stimulation. The frequencies of IFN-gamma-producing CD4+ cells did not change significantly in stable patients compared to those with BOS. Interestingly in BOS, the number of IL5- and IL10-producing cells was significantly lower than in stable patients (P < or = .05), suggesting a possible role of these Th2 cytokines in the modulation of graft tolerance.
