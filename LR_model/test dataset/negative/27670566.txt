Ileocolic and Jejunal Intussusceptions Requiring Surgical Intervention in a Pediatric Patient with Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is not uncommon in pediatrics. This case report describes a case of intestinal intussusception that occurred secondary to lymphoid hyperplasia in a child with PTLD following a cardiac transplant. This case was unique in its presentation with multiple areas of intussusception and with need for surgical intervention. The diagnosis of intussusception secondary to lead points from PTLD should be strongly considered in pediatric transplant patients presenting with abdominal complaints.
