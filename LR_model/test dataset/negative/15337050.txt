Morphological and functional magnetic resonance imaging after heterotopic heart transplantation. In patients with severe congestive heart failure, a marked elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance limits the success of orthotopic cardiac transplantation, providing the rationale for heterotopic transplantation. In the case reported, cardiac anatomy and function of two hearts in the same chest were imaged using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI offers a high-resolution, three-dimensional, noninvasive technique to visualize the complex anatomy after heterotopic heart transplantation, providing information of morphologic and functional parameters at the same time. The challenge of sufficient electrocardiogram triggering, hindered by two hearts with electrophysiological activity in the same chest, can be overcome using new real-time techniques.
