Noteworthy Literature Published in 2018 for Thoracic Organ Transplantation. Publications of note from 2018 are reviewed for the cardiothoracic transplant anesthesiologist. Strategies to expand the availability of donor organs were highlighted, including improved donor management, accumulating experience with increased-risk donors, ex vivo perfusion techniques, and donation after cardiac death. A number of reports examined posttransplant outcomes, including outcomes other than mortality, with new data-driven risk models. Use of extracorporeal support in cardiothoracic transplantation was a prominent theme. Major changes in adult heart allocation criteria were implemented, aiming to improve objectivity and transparency in the listing process. Frailty and prehabilitation emerged as targets of comprehensive perioperative risk mitigation programs.
