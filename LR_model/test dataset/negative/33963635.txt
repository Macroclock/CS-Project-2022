Immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in heart transplant recipients - a prospective cohort study. To assess the short-term immunogenicity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mRNA vaccine in a population of heart transplant (HTx) recipients. A prospective single-centre cohort study of HTx recipients who received a two-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech). Whole blood for anti-spike IgG (S-IgG) antibodies was drawn at days 21-26 and at days 35-40 after the first vaccine dose. Geometric mean titres (GMT) ≥50 AU/mL were interpreted positive. Included were 42 HTx recipients at a median age of 61 [interquartile range (IQR) 44-69] years. Median time from HTx to the first vaccine dose was 9.1 (IQR 2.6-14) years. Only 15% of HTx recipients demonstrated the presence of positive S-IgG antibody titres in response to the first vaccine dose [GMT 90 (IQR 54-229) AU/mL]. Overall, 49% of HTx recipients induced S-IgG antibodies in response to either the first or the full two-dose vaccine schedule [GMT 426 (IQR 106-884) AU/mL]. Older age [68 (IQR 59-70) years vs. 46 (IQR 34-63) years, P = 0.034] and anti-metabolite-based immunosuppression protocols (89% vs. 44%, P = 0.011) were associated with low immunogenicity. Importantly, 36% of HTx recipients who were non-responders to the first vaccine dose became S-IgG seropositive in response to the second vaccine dose. Approximately a half of HTx recipients did not generate S-IgG antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 two-dose vaccine. The generally achieved protection from SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination should be regarded with caution in the population of HTx recipients. The possible benefit of additive vaccine should be further studied. 'COVID-19', 'Heart transplantation', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Vaccine'
