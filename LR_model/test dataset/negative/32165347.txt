Combined Heart-Kidney Transplant Versus Sequential Kidney Transplant in Heart Transplant Recipients. In patients with reduced kidney function there are no established guidelines to suggest combined heart-kidney transplant (HKTx) versus sequential kidney transplant (SKTx) using preoperative value of estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR). The United Network for Organ Sharing database was queried from 2000 to 2015 to evaluate survival of HKTx and SKTx population stratified by preoperative eGFR rate <45 mL/min. Aim of the study was to assess the eGFR rate that is most beneficial to perform a concomitant or a SKTx at time of transplant evaluation. In our analysis, patients who required SKTx are recipients that, after heart transplantation, developed or worsened kidney insufficiency due to calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity. In recipients with eGFR <30 or dialysis, a total of 545 received HKTx and 80 received SKTx. The median waiting time between heart and kidney transplant in SKTx group was 6 years. The overall post-transplant survival was 81% and 80% and 75% and 59% at 5 and 1 years for the HKTx and SKTx groups, respectively (P = .04). In recipients with eGFR from 30 to 44, a total of 107 received HKTx and 112 received SKTx. The median waiting time between heart and kidney transplant in SKTx group was 4 years. Overall post-transplant survival showed no statistically significant differences in HKTx group (n=107) compared with SKTx group (n=112) and was 90% and 95% at 1 year and 74% and 52% at 5 years, respectively (P = .4) . To optimize organ and patient survival, eGFR value can be utilized to discern between HKTx versus SKTx in patients with decreased renal function at the time of heart transplantation. Patients with eGFR<30 or in dialysis presented better survival with HKTx, while both SKTx and HKTx are suitable for patients with eGFR between 30 and 45.
