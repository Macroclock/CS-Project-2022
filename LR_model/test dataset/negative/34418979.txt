Pseudoaneurysm of the ascending aorta: case report of a donor-derived Pseudomonas infection in a heart transplant recipient. Mycotic aortic pseudoaneurysm is a rare complication after heart transplantation (HTX) with remarkable mortality. Intrathoracic infection is a well-documented predisposing factor for this disease. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Candida species are commonly isolated from resected specimens of the pseudoaneurysms. We demonstrate a unique case of mycotic pseudoaneurysm caused by presumably donor-derived Pseudomonas infection in a heart transplant recipient. Our 67-year-old male patient treated with diabetes mellitus underwent HTX. The donor suffered from epiglottic abscess and pneumonia with known microorganisms including Pseudomonas, therefore both the donor and recipient received targeted antimicrobial therapy and prophylaxis. Five months after the uneventful HTX, lab test of the asymptomatic patient showed moderate, increasing C-reactive protein level without obviuos source of infection. Chest computed tomography showed a large (90 mm) saccular dilatation of the tubular portion of ascending aorta. Urgent surgical intervention identified a pseudoaneurysm, histological examinations and cultures of the resected aorta verified Pseudomonas aeruginosa aortitis, while all blood cultures remained negative. Retrospective interrogation of other transplanted organs of the donor supported donor-derived infection as the transport fluid of the right kidney grew Pseudomonas. The patient received 3 weeks of ceftazidime followed by 7 months of oral ciprofloxacin therapy. One year after the operation the patient was asymptomatic with normal inflammatory markers. Donor-derived infection is a rare but potential cause of aortitis. Early diagnosis, surgical intervention and adjuvant antibiotic therapy seem to be the keys to successful management of mycotic pseudoaneurysms after HTX.
