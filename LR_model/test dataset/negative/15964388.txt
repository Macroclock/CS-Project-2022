Impact of cardiac transplantation in 24 hours circadian blood pressure and heart rate profile. The aim of the present study was to evaluate 24 hours blood pressure (BP) and heart rate changes as well as 24-hour circadian BP rhythm of cardiac transplant recipients. Twenty-five transplant recipients and twenty-five healthy volunteers underwent 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. Parameters of 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (24-h/daytime/nightime systolic, diastolic BP, pulse pressure, and heart rate) were determined in all patients. Clinic systolic/diastolic BP, mean 24-h systolic/diastolic BP, mean daytime systolic/diastolic BP, mean nighttime systolic/diastolic BP, and mean 24-h/daytime/nighttime heart rate were significantly higher in transplant recipients than in control group subjects. Standard deviations of 24-h/daytime/nighttime heart rates were significantly lower in transplant recipients. Dippers were 48% of the control and only 12% of the transplantation group. Cardiac transplant recipients had increased ambulatory BP. They also had increased 24-h/daytime/nighttime heart rate and decreased heart rate variability. Also, diminished nocturnal decrease of BP was found in transplant recipients.
