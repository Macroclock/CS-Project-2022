Impact of Coronary Artery Calcification in the Donor Heart on Transmitted Coronary Artery Disease in Heart Transplant Recipients. Coronary artery disease (CAD) after heart transplantation (HTx) develops as a combination of donor-transmitted coronary atherosclerosis (DTCA) and cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Assessing donor CAD before procurement is important. Because coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a predictor for CAD, donor-heart CAC is usually evaluated to estimate the risk of donor CAD. The usefulness of CAC for predicting DTCA, however, is not known. Methods and Results: Sixty-four HTx recipients whose donor underwent chest computed tomography before procurement or ≤2 weeks after HTx and who underwent coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) ≤3 months after HTx were enrolled. Eight patients had CAC (CAC group) and 56 patients did not have CAC (no-CAC group). Patients in the CAC group were significantly older and had a higher prevalence of maximum intimal thickness (MIT) of the coronary artery ≥0.5 mm at initial IVUS than patients in the no-CAC group (100% vs. 55%, P=0.02). Adverse cardiac events and death were not significantly different. Everolimus tended to be used more often in the CAC group. Donor-heart CAC is a significant predictor for MIT of the coronary artery ≥0.5 mm after HTx. The presence of CAC, however, is not associated with future cardiac events. The higher prevalence of everolimus use in the CAC group may have affected the results.
