Hypodermin A, a new inhibitor of human complement for the prevention of xenogeneic hyperacute rejection. Hyperacute rejection (HAR) of discordant xenografts in the pig-to-human combination can be prevented using tranplants expressing transgenic molecules that inhibit human complement. Hypodermin A (HA), a serine esterase that degrades C3, was tested in the guinea-pig-to-rat and in the pig-to-human combinations. Hypodermin A was tested in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models of HAR in the guinea-pig-to-rat combination. Hamster ovary cells (CHO) and a line of porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC11) were transfected with HA complementary DNA (cDNA). The pattern of degradation of rat and human C3 by HA was different (multiple bands lower than 40 kDa) from the physiologic pattern observed after spontaneous degradation of rat C3 or physiologic activation of human C3. The CH50 activity in serum was significantly lower in rats treated with 3.2 mg HA/kg than in untreated rats (45 +/- 16 U/ml vs. 700 +/- 63 U/ml, P < 0.05). Sera from rats injected with 3.2 mg/kg of HA were less effective in lysing guinea-pig endothelial cells (12 +/- 7%) than normal rat sera (79 +/- 3%; P < 0.001). Ex vivo, guinea-pig hearts perfused by rat serum supplemented with HA survived longer than those perfused by non-treated serum (210 +/- 34 and 154 +/- 71 min, respectively; P < 0.05). In vivo, guinea-pig hearts transplanted into HA treated rats survived longer than in non-treated rats (27 +/- 5 min vs. 13 +/- 4 min; P < 0.001). In the presence of human serum, smaller amounts of C6 and C5b-9 were deposited onto HA-transfected CHO cells than onto control cells. The mHA-PAEC11 cells were significantly more resistant to lysis by human C than control PAEC11 cells. These data suggest that transgenic HA could be used to prevent hyperacute xenogeneic rejection.
