Long-term management of end-stage heart failure. End-stage heart failure manifests as severe and often relentless symptoms that define the clinical syndrome of heart failure, namely congestion and hypoperfusion. These patients suffer from dyspnea, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and ultimately cardiac cachexia. Renal and hepatic dysfunction frequently further complicates the process. Recurrent hospitalizations, cardiac arrhythmias, and intolerance to standard heart failure therapies are common as the disease progresses. Management focuses on controlling symptoms, correcting precipitants, avoiding triggers, and maximizing therapies with demonstrable survival benefit. Among appropriate candidates, advanced therapies such as orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) can significantly extend survival and improve the quality of life. Left ventricular assist devices have been used with increasing frequency as a bridge to OHT or as a destination therapy in appropriately selected candidates where they have a demonstrable mortality benefit over medical therapy. Importantly, a multidisciplinary patient-centered approach is crucial when considering these advanced therapies.
