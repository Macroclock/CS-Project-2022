An overview of stem cell therapy for paediatric heart failure. Significant achievements in paediatric cardiology, surgical treatment and intensive care of congenital heart disease have drastically changed clinical outcomes for paediatric patients. Nevertheless, late-onset heart failure in children after staged surgeries still remains a serious concern in the medical community. Heart transplantation is an option for treatment; however, the shortage of available organs is a persistent problem in many developed countries. In order to resolve these issues, advanced technologies, such as innovative mechanical circulatory support devices and regenerative therapies, are strongly desired. Accumulated evidence regarding cell-based cardiac regenerative therapies has suggested their safety and efficacy in treating adult heart failure. Given that young children seem to have a higher regenerative capacity than adults, stem cell-based therapies appear a promising treatment option for paediatric heart failure as well. Based on the findings from past trials and studies, we present the potential of various different types of stem cells, ranging from bone marrow mononuclear cells to cardiosphere-derived stem cells for use in paediatric cell-based therapies. Here, we assess both the current challenges associated with cell-based therapies and novel strategies that may be implemented in the future to advance stem cell therapy in the paediatric population.
