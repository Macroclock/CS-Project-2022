Pregnancy after cardiac transplantation. More women are reporting pregnancy following heart transplantation. Although successful outcomes have been reported for the mother, transplanted heart, and newborn, such pregnancies should be considered high risk. Hypertension, preeclampsia, and infection should be treated. Vaginal delivery is recommended unless cesarean section is obstetrically necessary. Most outcomes are live births, and long-term follow-up of children show most are healthy and developing well. Maternal survival, independent of pregnancy-related events, should be part of prepregnancy counseling.
