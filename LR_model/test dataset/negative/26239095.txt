Tropheryma whipplei Endocarditis: A Two-patient Case Series. Whipple endocarditis is caused by Tropheryma whipplei and is a well-described complication of Whipple's disease. Limited and small case series have been published regarding the presentation, diagnosis, and clinical course of this disease. We describe 2 cases of patients with T. whipplei endocarditis, one of which underwent a successful heart transplant. In both cases of Whipple's endocarditis, there was a subacute prodromal phase followed by an acute rapid decompensation with severe destruction of the aortic valve, heart failure, and embolism. Because the diagnosis of T. whipplei endocarditis is typically not made until pathological examination of tissue, clinicians must have a high suspicion for it in the absence of other offending organisms, especially among middle-aged white males with sub-acute symptoms and embolic complications.
