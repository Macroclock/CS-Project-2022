Single-centre experience with the Thoratec paracorporeal ventricular assist device for patients with primary cardiac failure. Temporary mechanical circulatory support may be indicated in some patients with cardiac failure refractory to conventional therapy, as a bridge to myocardial recovery or transplantation. To evaluate outcomes in cardiogenic shock patients managed by the primary use of a paracorporeal ventricular assist device (p-VAD). We did a retrospective analysis of demographics, clinical characteristics and survival of patients assisted with a Thoratec p-VAD. p-VADs were used in 84 patients with cardiogenic shock secondary to acute myocardial infarction (35%), idiopathic (31%) or ischaemic (12%) cardiomyopathy, myocarditis or other causes (23%). Before implantation, 23% had cardiac arrest, 38% were on a ventilator and 31% were on an intra-aortic balloon pump. Cardiac index was 1.6+/-0.5 L/min/m(2) and total bilirubin levels were 39+/-59 micromol/L. During support, 29 patients (35%) died in the intensive care unit and seven (10%) died after leaving. Forty-seven patients (56%) were weaned or transplanted, with one still under support. Despite significantly more advanced preoperative end-organ dysfunction, survival rates were similar in patients with biventricular devices (74%) and those undergoing isolated left ventricular support (24%) (63% versus 45%, respectively; p=0.2). Actuarial survival estimates after transplantation were 78.7+/-6.3%, 73.4+/-6.9% and 62.6+/-8.3% at 1, 3 and 5 years, respectively. Our experience validates the use of p-VAD as a primary device to support patients with cardiogenic shock. In contrast to short-term devices, p-VADs provide immediate ventricular unloading and pulsatile perfusion in a single procedure. Biventricular support should be used liberally in patients with end-organ dysfunction.
