Combined heart-liver transplantation for failing Fontan circulation in a late survivor with single-ventricle physiology. Management of adults with failing Fontan physiology poses many challenges, especially as transplantation offers the only realistic alternative to palliative care. We present the first combined heart and liver transplant performed in Europe, for a late survivor of single ventricle palliation with the Fontan circulation. In addition to the conventional medical and surgical challenges posed, we highlight the management of the associated multi-organ failure with focus on the liver and novel strategies for assessment and optimization.
