Perioperative and long-term management of Fontan patients. A Fontan circulation requires a series of three-staged operations aimed to palliate patients with single-ventricle CHD. Currently, the most frequent technique is the extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection, an external conduit connecting the IVC and right pulmonary artery, bypassing the right side of the heart. Fontan candidates must meet strict criteria; they are assessed utilising both cardiac catheterisation and cardiac magnetic resonance. Postoperatively, treatment protocols prioritise antibiotic prophylaxis, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, anticoagulation, and oxygen therapy with fluid restriction and a low-fat diet. These measures aim to reduce length of stay in the ICU and hospital by preventing acute complications such as infection, venous thromboembolism, low cardiac output, pleural effusion, and acute kidney injury. Late complications of a Fontan procedure include circulation failure, protein-losing enteropathy, plastic bronchitis, and Fontan-associated liver disease. The definitive management is cardiac transplantation, with promising innovations in selective embolisation of lymphatic vessels and Fontan-specific ventricular assist devices. Further research assessing current protocols in the perioperative management of Fontan patients would be beneficial for standardising current practice and improving outcomes.
