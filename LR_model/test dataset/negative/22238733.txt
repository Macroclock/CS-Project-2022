Of the 190 registered dentists, 169 (88.94%) completed the questionnaire. The mean age of the population was 39.17 Â± 8.23 years. The majority of the respondents correctly identified that having prosthetic cardiac valves, a previous history of IE illness and cardiac transplantation with subsequent cardiac valvulopathy are cardiac conditions requiring antibiotic prophylaxis. Prescription of first-line antibiotic drugs and second-line drug regimens corresponding to the current guidelines was correctly answered by only 56.21% dentists and 60.95% dentists, respectively. A relatively low level of knowledge of the new guidelines was reported among dentists, reflecting the need for more continuing dental education programmes.
