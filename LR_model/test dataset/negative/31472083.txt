The use of genome sequencing to investigate an outbreak of hospital-acquired mucormycosis in transplant patients. We report three cases of hospital-acquired mucormycosis in heart and lung transplant patients over a 6-month period. Traditional epidemiological investigation tools were used to look for a common link between patients to explain the outbreak. Genome sequencing of each fungal strain was used to supplement the investigation. By disproving a close genetic link between infecting strains of mucormycosis, we were able to conclude the outbreak investigation. Genome sequencing is a novel tool that can be used in addition to traditional epidemiologic investigations to help determine linkage of patients during outbreak investigations.
