[Diabetes mellitus and heart failure - incidence and surgical therapy options]. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in heart failure populations is close to 20% compared with 4-6% in control populations. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated an increased risk of heart failure in diabetics. Experimental and clinical studies support the existence of a specific diabetic cardiomyopathy related to microangiopathy, metabolic factors or myocardial fibrosis. The knowledge of the diabetes status may help to define the optimal therapeutic strategy for heart failure patients. In ischemic cardiomyopathy the choice of the surgical treatment may differ according to diabetes status, coronary atherosclerosis and left ventricular function. At present, surgical revascularization techniques seem to be superior to interventional revascularization procedures. In the last decade a growing part of diabetics presenting severe heart failure underwent heart transplantation. Thereby, it was found that the survival rates of patients with uncomplicated diabetes mellitus and of nondiabetics did not differ. The survival rates in patients with severe and progressive form of diabetes mellitus are discussed controversially in the literature. Because of donor organ shortage each diabetic patient presenting severe heart failure should be evaluated to find the best therapy including permanent mechanical circulatory support ("destination therapy").
