Creation of a self-made total artificial heart using combined components of available ventricular assist devices. We describe the case of a 39-year-old woman who received a self-made total artificial heart built of components from the Thoratec and ExCor Berlin Heart systems. The patient had a severe aortic/myocardial infection following replacement of the ascending aorta with a Shelhigh conduit due to type A aortic dissection. The surgical technique is described in detail in this article. This technique is feasible if a total artificial heart is not available and implantation of a biventricular assist device is not possible.
