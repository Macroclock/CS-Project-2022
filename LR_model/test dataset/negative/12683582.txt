Cardiac fibroma in an infant: single ventricle palliation as a bridge to heart transplantation. A prenatal echocardiogram revealed a large right ventricular mass. Following birth, there was obstruction to pulmonary blood flow and cyanosis. The tumor's size and location prevented resection. The patient underwent "single ventricle palliation," including placement of a systemic-to-pulmonary shunt as a newborn. This palliation served as a successful bridge to heart transplantation at 7 months of age. Pathologic examination revealed cardiac fibroma.
