Array-based methods for diagnosis and prevention of transplant rejection. DNA microarray is a microhybridization-based assay that is used to simultaneously study the expression of thousands of genes, thus providing a global view of gene expression in a tissue sample. This powerful technique has been adopted by many biomedical disciplines and will likely have a profound impact on the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of human diseases. This review article presents an overview of the application of microarray technology to the field of solid-organ transplantation.
