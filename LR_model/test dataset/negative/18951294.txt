Multiple indications for anti-inflammatory apolipoprotein mimetic peptides. Apolipoprotein mimetic peptides dramatically reduce atherosclerosis in animal models, and may be an excellent mode of therapy to treat a variety of vascular inflammatory conditions, including atherosclerosis. Studies of apolipoprotein mimetic peptides in models of inflammatory disorders other than atherosclerosis, including viral influenza, asthma, chronic rejection after heart transplantation, sickle cell disease, scleroderma, diabetes, cognitive dysfunction and renal inflammation, suggest that apolipoprotein mimetic peptides may have efficacy in a wide range of inflammatory conditions.
