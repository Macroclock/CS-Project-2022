CD4+CD25 CD4+CD25 Heterotopic cardiac xenotransplantation was performed on baboons using hearts obtained from GTKO.hCD46 (n = 8) and GTKO.hCD46.TBM (n = 5) genetically modified pigs. Modified immunosuppression regimen included antithymocyte globulin (ATG), anti-CD20, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), cobra venom factor (CVF), and costimulation blockade (anti-CD154/anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody). FACS analysis was performed on PBLs labeled with anti-human CD4, CD25, and FoxP3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to analyze the percentage of Treg cells in six baboons that survived longer than 2 months (range: 42-945 days) after receiving a pig cardiac xenograft. Total WBC count was low due to immunosuppression in baboons who received cardiac xenograft from GTKO.hCD46 and GTKO.hCD46.hTBM donor pigs. However, absolute numbers of CD4+CD25 Our results suggest that regulatory T (Treg) cells may contribute to preventing or delaying xenograft rejection by controlling the activation and expansion of donor-reactive T cells, thereby masking the antidonor immune response, leading to long-term survival of cardiac xenografts.
