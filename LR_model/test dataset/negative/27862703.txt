Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) therapy for refractory rejections in pediatric heart transplant recipients. Despite substantial improvements in survival after pediatric heart transplantation, refractory rejection remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. We have utilized ALE (Campath-1H) in six consecutive patients with refractory rejection. These rejection episodes persisted despite conventional treatment, which included intravenous methylprednisolone, rituximab, immunoglobulin G, and antithymocyte globulin. In our series, after ALE therapy, LV SF increased from 22%±5% to 33%±5% (P=.01). However, in our series, ALE therapy neither led to persistent LV function recovery nor could it prevent subsequent antibody-mediated rejection.
