HEMO Prior to heart transplantation, static storage of donor hearts is currently limited to 4-5 h, despite profound hypothermia (4-8 °C). Because heart transplantation is an emergency procedure, improved protection to extend safe storage duration would be advantageous. We investigated whether the naturally respiratory pigment HEMO Isolated Langendorff-perfused rat hearts (n = 12/group) were equilibrated (20 min) and function (left ventricular developed pressure: LVDP) measured by intraventricular balloon before arrest with cold (7.5 °C) Celsior Hearts recovered rapidly in both groups to a plateau by 20 min of reperfusion; control and HEMO The addition of the natural oxygen releasing pigment HEMO 'Extracellular hemoglobin', 'heart graft preservation', 'langendorff model', 'oxygen carrier'
