Role of the CTLA4 pathway in hyporesponsiveness induced by intratracheal delivery of alloantigen. The authors previously reported that intratracheal delivery (ITD) of donor alloantigen induced donor-specific hyporesponsiveness to C57BL/10 cardiac allografts in CBA recipients and that blockade of the B7 pathways abrogated that hyporesponsiveness. In this study, the authors used a CD28-deficient model to evaluate which signal, either through CD28 or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA4), is involved in the induction of hyporesponsiveness. Seven days before transplantation of hearts from C3H/HeJ (H2k) mice into C57BL/6 (H2b) or CD28-deficient (C57BL/6 background) mice, the transplant recipients were given ITD of donor splenocytes (1 x 10(7)), alone or in combination with human CTLA4-immunoglobulin (Ig) (200 microg). ITD of C3H splenocytes induced donor-specific hyporesponsiveness to C3H cardiac grafts in C57BL/6 recipients (graft median survival time [MST], 40 days). Administration of CTLA4-Ig concurrently with ITD abrogated the prolonged allograft survival (MST, 12 days). Interestingly, ITD of C3H splenocytes induced prolonged survival of C3H allografts in CD28-deficient recipients (MST, 55 days). Furthermore, administration of CTLA4-Ig combined with ITD of C3H splenocytes abrogated the prolonged survival of C3H allografts in CD28-deficient recipients (MST, 7 days), whereas recipients given isotype-control antibody in combination with ITD of splenocytes had prolonged survival of C3H allografts (MST, 58 days). Taken together, the authors' findings indicate that a signal through CTLA4, rather than through CD28, plays an important role in the induction of hyporesponsiveness by ITD of alloantigen in this model.
