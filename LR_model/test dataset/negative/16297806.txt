Effects of conversion from cyclosporine to tacrolimus on left ventricular structure in cardiac allograft recipients. Twelve heart transplant recipients selected for conversion from cyclosporine to tacrolimus because of adverse effects of cyclosporine therapy underwent echocardiography at baseline and 6 months after conversion. Left ventricular mass decreased by 24% and left ventricular geometry returned toward normal at 6 months after conversion, without significant changes in blood pressure.
