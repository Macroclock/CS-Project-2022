Kidney-induced cardiac allograft tolerance in miniature swine is dependent on MHC-matching of donor cardiac and renal parenchyma. Kidney allografts possess the ability to enable a short course of immunosuppression to induce tolerance of themselves and of cardiac allografts across a full-MHC barrier in miniature swine. However, the renal element(s) responsible for kidney-induced cardiac allograft tolerance (KICAT) are unknown. Here we investigated whether MHC disparities between parenchyma versus hematopoietic-derived "passenger" cells of the heart and kidney allografts affected KICAT. Heart and kidney allografts were co-transplanted into MHC-mismatched recipients treated with high-dose tacrolimus for 12 days. Group 1 animals (n = 3) received kidney and heart allografts fully MHC-mismatched to each other and to the recipient. Group 2 animals (n = 3) received kidney and heart allografts MHC-matched to each other but MHC-mismatched to the recipient. Group 3 animals (n = 3) received chimeric kidney allografts whose parenchyma was MHC-mismatched to the donor heart. Group 4 animals (n = 3) received chimeric kidney allografts whose passenger leukocytes were MHC-mismatched to the donor heart. Five of six heart allografts in Groups 1 and 3 rejected <40 days. In contrast, heart allografts in Groups 2 and 4 survived >150 days without rejection (p < 0.05). These data demonstrate that KICAT requires MHC-matching between kidney allograft parenchyma and heart allografts, suggesting that cells intrinsic to the kidney enable cardiac allograft tolerance.
