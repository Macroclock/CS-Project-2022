Infections in cardiac transplant recipients: clinical and microbiological characteristics and consequences. Infections are one of the main complications that cause morbidity and mortality in cardiac transplant recipients. We sought to establish the incidence of infections, identify the predisposing factors and determine their consequences. A prospective study of 30 patients who received cardiac transplantations in our hospital from July 2003 to May 2005. Of the 30 transplant recipients, 93.3% were men (average age, 48 years); the average age of the women was 53 years. The incidence of infection was 70%: 21 episodes of infection. The main clinical symptoms were bacteriemia (28%), pneumonia (19%), and surgical wound infections (14%). The etiology of the infection, as established in 12 cases (57%), was bacterial (66%), viral (25%), or fungal (9%). The most common microorganisms were cytomegalovirus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus. None of the donors had a history of infection. There was a higher frequency of serious complications, such as renal failure (12.9%), respiratory insufficiency (9.6%), and multiorgan failure (9.6%) among patients with versus without infections (P < .05). The 1-year survival rate of patients with infections was similar to that of patients with no infections (83% vs 88%, P = NS). The incidence of infections was 70%. Bacteremia, pneumonia, and surgical wound infections occurred most frequently. Cytomegalovirus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus were the most frequent microorganisms. Patients with infections had the most serious complications, but their survival rate was similar to that of patients free of this complication.
