Cardiac allograft vasculopathy: Insights on pathogenesis and therapy. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a unique accelerated form of coronary vascular disease affecting heart transplant recipients. This complication is a significant contributor to medium- to long-term post-transplant morbidity and mortality. There is a high prevalence of CAV with approximately one in three patients developing CAV by 5Â years post-transplant. Morphologically, CAV is characterized by concentric coronary intimal hyperplasia in both the epicardial arteries and intramural microvasculature. Although several immune and non-immune factors have been identified, their precise pathogenic mechanisms, interactions, and relative importance in the development of CAV are not well defined. The advent of improved imaging surveillance modalities has resulted in earlier detection during the disease process. However, overall management of CAV remains challenging due to paucity of treatment. This review aims to discuss key concepts on the pathogenesis of CAV and current management strategies, focusing on the use of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors.
