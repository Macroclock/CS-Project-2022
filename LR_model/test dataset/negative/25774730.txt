[Treatment of chronic heart failure: what's not (yet) in the guidelines]. 2012 Scientific meeting of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), the current Guidelines on Acute and Chronic Heart Failure were introduced whose preparation had started 18 months earlier. These guidelines integrate scientific evidence of the years 2011 and 2012, leaving several questions open due to gaps in knowledge. These questions relate, amongst others, to diagnostics and imaging, non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic therapeutic approaches, mechanical support therapy, and heart transplantation. Based on recent studies, we will address some of these questions and discuss potential impact of their results on current clinical practice. A further official update of the ESC heart failure guidelines is expected for early 2016, which will then show if today's assessment holds true.
