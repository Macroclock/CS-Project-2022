Immune response to allograft implantation in children with congenital heart defects. Cryopreserved valved allografts are frequently used in the repair of congenital heart defects in children. Although the longevity of these grafts is generally good in most patients, there continue to be ongoing problems with allograft dysfunction and subsequent failure, particularly in infants and young children. The aim of this review is to discuss the immunogenicity of cryopreserved allograft tissue and measures that may minimize the deleterious effect of the immune system on allograft function and durability.
