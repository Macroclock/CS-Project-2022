Induction of endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression by IL-17 in human vascular endothelial cells: implications for vascular remodeling in transplant vasculopathy. IL-17 is a signature cytokine of Th17 cells, a recently described subset of effector CD4 T cells implicated in the development of several pathologies. We have examined the role of IL-17 in regulating endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) expression in human vascular endothelial cells (ECs) because of the key role of eNOS in determining the pathological outcome of immune-mediated vascular diseases. In cultured ECs, IL-17 increased expression of eNOS, eNOS phosphorylation at Ser(1177), and NO production. The induction of eNOS expression by IL-17 was prevented by the pharmacological inhibition of NF-ÎºB, MEK, and JNK, as well as by small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing of these signaling pathways. The expression of IL-17 was then examined by immunohistochemistry in human arteries affected by transplant vasculopathy (TV), a vascular condition that is a leading reflection of chronic heart transplant rejection. IL-17 was expressed by infiltrating leukocytes in the intima of arteries with TV, and the majority of IL-17-positive cells were T cells. The number of IL-17-positive cells was not correlated with the intima/media ratio, but was negatively correlated with the amount of luminal occlusion. There was also a significant positive correlation between the number of IL-17-positive cells and the density of eNOS-expressing luminal ECs in arteries with TV. Altogether, these findings show that IL-17 induces the expression of eNOS in human ECs and that this may facilitate outward expansion of arteries afflicted with TV.
