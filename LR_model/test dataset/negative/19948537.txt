Successful use of continuous flow ventricular assist device in a patient with mechanical mitral and aortic valve prosthesis without replacement or exclusion of valves. In patients with left-sided mechanical aortic prostheses, it is recommended that the mechanical valve be replaced with a bioprosthesis, or excluded, at implantation of left ventricular assist device (LVAD). As changes in flow across the valve leads to potential thromboembolic complications, mechanical valves within the native heart are a relative contraindication to LVAD therapy. We here describe a patient who had long-standing valvular cardiomyopathy with mitral Starr-Edwards mechanical valve (Edwards Lifesciences, CA, USA) and aortic bileaflet tilting disc (St Jude Medical, St Paul, MN, USA) where LVAD was placed without explantation of the mechanical heart valves. The patient was bridged successfully to transplantation without thromboembolic events.
