The complication rate of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in a multicenter pediatric heart transplant population: A study of the international pediatric IVUS consortium. Our purpose was to determine the complication rate from intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in a large, multicenter cohort of pediatric heart transplant (PHT) patients. We retrospectively reviewed all PHT who underwent IVUS at 5 institutions (2006-2014). Rates of major and minor complications were calculated. All adverse events (AE) were graded from 1 to 5 using a previously published AE severity scale. There were 1380 catheterizations in 505 patients and 32 AE (2.3%); 9 major (0.6%) and 23 AE (1.7%). The major AE attributed to IVUS were all coronary artery vasospasm (7). Major and minor AE rates directly related to IVUS were 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Minor AE possibly attributable to IVUS included excessive fluoroscopy (3) and transient ST segment changes (7). Of AE related to IVUS, only 3 were of moderate severity. The rest were ≤ minor in severity. There were no reports of coronary artery dissection or death. Most AE during routine PHT coronary evaluation with IVUS were minor and not directly related to the use of IVUS. The number of coronary related AE was similar to a registry-based report of coronary angiography alone. Efforts to minimize IVUS-related complications should be focused on preventing coronary artery vasospasm.
