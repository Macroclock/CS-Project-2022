Advances and future directions for mechanical circulatory support. Although cardiac transplant remains the gold standard for the treatment of end-stage heart failure, limited donor organ availability and growing numbers of eligible recipients have increased the demand for alternative therapies. Limitations of first-generation left ventricular assist devices for long-term support of patients with end-stage disease have led to the development of newer second-generation and third-generation pumps, which are smaller, have fewer moving parts, and have shown improved durability, allowing for extended support. The HeartMate II (second generation) and HeartWare (third generation) are 2 devices that have shown great promise as potential alternatives to transplantation in select patients.
