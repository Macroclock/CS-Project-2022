High incidence of cytomegalovirus disease in D+/R- heart transplant recipients shortly after completion of 3 months of valganciclovir prophylaxis. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a serious problem after heart transplantation. Recipients with D(+)/R(-) CMV serostatus often receive prophylaxis with valganciclovir, but the optimal duration of such therapy after heart transplant is unknown. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical course of all adult cardiac transplant recipients with D(+)/R(-) CMV serostatus at the UT Southwestern Medical Center between January 2003 and December 2006. Standard immunosuppression included basiliximab induction therapy and the CMV prophylaxis included CMV hyperimmune globulin, 2 weeks of intravenous ganciclovir and 3 months of oral valganciclovir. Seven patients met the study criteria. Six of the 7 patients (86%) developed CMV disease. Five of these 6 patients presented with CMV disease within 3 months of the cessation of valganciclovir prophylaxis. There was a high incidence of CMV disease in D(+)/R(-) heart transplant recipients despite CMV hyperimmune globulin, 2 weeks of intravenous ganciclovir and 3 months of valganciclovir prophylaxis. CMV infection occurred consistently within 2 to 3 months of cessation of valganciclovir. Alternative strategies for CMV prophylaxis, including an extension of valganciclovir prophylaxis to 6 months after heart transplantation, needs to be investigated.
