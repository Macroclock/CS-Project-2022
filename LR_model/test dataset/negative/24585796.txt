Use of Rotaflow pump for left ventricular assist device bridging for 15 weeks. Mechanical circulatory support systems have been described for short- and long-term left ventricular assistance. We report the use of a Rotaflow centrifugal pump in a 55-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy and severe left ventricular dysfunction. He was successfully bridged to transplantation with 15 weeks of Rotaflow support, with no major adverse events. 'Heart failure', 'heart transplantation', 'heart-assist devices'
