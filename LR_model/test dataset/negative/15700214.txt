Development of ulcerative colitis after heart transplantation during immunosuppressive therapy. Cardiac transplantation has become an accepted treatment modality for end-stage heart failure. Immunosuppressive agents, which are used after transplantation, are considered as therapeutic options for inflammatory bowel disease. We report on a 53-year-old patient who was treated for 2 years with cyclosporine A, azathioprine and prednisolone after heart transplantation. He developed a distal colitis with all features of ulcerative colitis. An infectious or ischemic etiology was carefully excluded. In spite of high-dose treatment with prednisolone the patient's abdominal symptoms worsened and he developed a progression of the inflammation in the entire colon and a colectomy with ileostomy was necessary. The histology was consistent with ulcerative colitis. After colectomy he recovered and remained in a good state of health. This report supports the concept that new onset inflammatory bowel disease can develop in a heart transplantation recipient in spite of immunosuppression.
