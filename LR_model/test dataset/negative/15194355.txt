Microchimerism does not correlate with survival of murine cardiac allografts. The development of microchimerism was evaluated at different time points after infusion of a mixed population of bone marrow and spleen cells from (BALB/c x C57Bl/6)F1 mice in the presence or absence of a cardiac transplant. Microchimerism was observed in the spleen, bone marrow and thymus of transplanted BALB/c mice even after graft rejection. In the absence of transplantation, donor cells persisted especially in the thymus. The results show that despite augmentation of graft survival after donor cell infusion compared to nontreated controls, the development of microchimerism did not sustain cardiac semihistocompatible grafts. Moreover, the persistence of donor cells in the thymus in both situations suggests a role for this organ in the increased graft survival in our model.
