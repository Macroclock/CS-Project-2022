Open-chest epicardial approach to transcatheter pulmonary artery stenting following heart transplantation in an infant. We describe an open-chest epicardial approach to transcatheter pulmonary artery stenting in a critically ill infant following heart transplantation. Technical considerations, indications, and feasibility are discussed. This case provides another example of the value of a "hybrid" approach (combining surgery and interventional cardiology) to complex congenital heart disease.
