Orthotopic retransplantation in heterotopic transplant recipients: 3 case reports. We report 3 patients who initially underwent heterotopic transplantation due to a size mismatch but then later underwent orthotopic retransplantation because of heart failure. In each case, the heterotopic graft was left in place, the native heart was removed, and the new allograft was placed orthotopically. This technique resulted in reduced postoperative morbidity and excellent long-term outcomes.
