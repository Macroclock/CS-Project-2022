Coronary artery-pulmonary artery fistula in a heart-transplanted patient. A 64-year-old-man underwent routine elective right-left heart catheterization, 1 year after cardiac transplantation for terminal ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Surprisingly, selective coronary angiography disclosed coronary-pulmonary artery fistula with three feeding vessels originating from the proximal right coronary artery, the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery, the circumflexus artery, and the left main coronary artery, draining into the pulmonary trunk. For this particular patient, without any significant cardiac complaints or symptoms, with normal cardiac dimensions and haemodynamic findings, a conservative approach was decided on.
