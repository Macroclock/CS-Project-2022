Ascites and Edema After Bicaval Orthotopic Heart Transplant. IVC stenosis is a rare complication of bicaval orthotopic heart transplant. IVC stenosis can occur at either the cavo-atrial anastomosis, or the caval cannulation site, with presentations ranging from acute shock early post transplant to a more indolent course. Causes include extensive hemostatic suturing, fibrous contraction, and donor-recipient size mismatch. Treatment strategies include percutaneous balloon angioplasty, stenting, and surgical revision. Evaluating for IVC stenosis is recommended for unexplained lower-extremity edema, new-onset ascites, or liver abnormalities after bicaval heart transplant. 'inferior vena cava', 'stenosis'
