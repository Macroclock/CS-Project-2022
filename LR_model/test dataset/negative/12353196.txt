The economic value of valacyclovir prophylaxis in transplantation. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease, with its extensive direct and indirect consequences, adds considerably to the cost of patient management in both solid organ and bone marrow transplantation. Antiviral prophylaxis for CMV infection can offer cost advantages over preemptive therapy and "wait-and-treat" approaches. Valacyclovir has demonstrated efficacy for CMV prophylaxis in renal, heart, and bone marrow transplantation and is cost-effective when compared with placebo in renal transplant recipients at high risk of CMV infection. In reducing CMV infection and disease, valacyclovir prophylaxis appears to be associated with reductions in indirect effects of CMV (acute graft rejection, other opportunistic infections) and, if these effects are considered, the potential exists for even greater savings to be made with valacyclovir therapy. Benefits of valacyclovir in transplantation extend beyond CMV to other herpesviruses and may be increased in some clinical situations by prolonging prophylaxis beyond 3 months.
