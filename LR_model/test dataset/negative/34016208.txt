Takayasu's arteritis presenting as acute myocardial infarction: case series and review of literature. This series describes three adolescent females who presented with chest pain and ventricular dysfunction related to acute coronary ischemia secondary to Takayasu's arteritis with varied courses of disease progression leading to a diverse range of therapies including cardiac transplantation. While Takayasu's arteritis is rare in childhood, it should be strongly considered in any adolescent female presenting with systemic inflammation and chest pain consistent with myocardial infarction. A high index of suspicion can lead to early detection and aggressive management of the underlying vasculitis reducing associated morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this report is to describe the challenges in the clinical diagnosis and management of Takayasu's arteritis with myocardial infarction. We also seek to enhance awareness about unique presentations of Takayasu's arteritis within the paediatric community. 'Takayasu arteritis', 'cardiac transplantation', 'myocardial infarction'
