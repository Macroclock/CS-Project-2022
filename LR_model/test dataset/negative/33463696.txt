Surgical Implantation Techniques of Modern Continuous Flow Ventricular Assist Devices. Implantable left ventricular assist devices (durable LVADs) have dramatically improved mortality and morbidity in patients with advanced heart failure. Originally designed as a bridge or candidacy to heart transplantation, the indications extend toward permanent support and palliation. Modern durable continuous flow LVADs are small, commercially available, and allow for different surgical approaches to a wide range of patients with various cardiac pathologies. We will review different surgical implantation techniques of modern continuous flow LVADs, as well as specific aspects of preoperative patient evaluation and planning.
