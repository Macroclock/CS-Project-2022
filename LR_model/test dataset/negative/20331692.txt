Perioperative management of combined heart-liver transplantation in patients with cirrhosis, renal insufficiency, or pulmonary hypertension. STATING THE MAIN PROBLEM: Only few reports have detailed perioperative management and outcome of combined heart and liver transplantation (CHLT), and none describe the long-term renal function. Three patients presented clinical signs of cardiomyopathy with reduced ejection fraction and proven cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension. Two of them presented renal failure, and the other pulmonary hypertension. After cardiac transplantation and closure of the sternum, liver transplantation was performed using systematically venovenous double-limb (portal and caval) bypass. Mean cold ischemic time for heart and liver was 2 h 46 min and 12 h 47 min, respectively. Intraoperative hemodynamics remained grossly stable during surgery. Mean transfusions were 12 red blood cell packs. All three patients received anti-R-Il2 antibodies at post-operative day 1 and 4. Mean plasma creatinine concentration was 90 ± 8 μmol/L one yr post-CHLT, vs 160 ± 62 μmol/L pre-CHLT. All three patients are alive with functional grafts after a mean follow-up of 26 months (12-38). CHLT could be performed safely through two consecutive and independent usual procedures. Perioperative hemodynamic stability, minimal blood loss, and routine splanchnic decompression are probably major determinants of a favorable outcome and good long-term renal function.
