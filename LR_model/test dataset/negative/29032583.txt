Third Generation Ventricular Assist Device: Mid-Term Outcomes of the HeartWare HVAD in Pediatric Patients. The HeartWare HVAD is a small, third generation continuous flow pump that is intracorporeally placed for support of a failing ventricle in adult patients. This device is small in size when compared to other left ventricular assist devices and can therefore be used in smaller sized pediatric patients. We present our initial experience using the HVAD as a bridge to heart transplantation in the pediatric population. We performed a retrospective, single center, nonrandomized review of 17 pediatric patients who underwent HVAD implantation between June 2013 and March 2016. The primary endpoints evaluated in this study were overall survival to heart transplantation, ongoing device support, or death. In this patient cohort, nine (53%) of 17 patients were male. The median age of the patients was 13.4 ± 3.8 (range 5-17) years. The median body surface area was 1.4 ± 0.4(0.7-2) m '-Mechanical circulatory support', '-Pediatrics', 'Ventricular Assist devices'
