Management of reproductive health after cardiac transplantation. Pregnancy after cardiac transplantation poses immense challenges. Maternal risks include hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, rejection, and failure of the cardiac allograft that may lead to death. Fetal risks include potential teratogenic effects of immunosuppression and prematurity. Because of the high-risk nature of pregnancy in a heart transplant patient, management of reproductive health after cardiac transplantation should include preconception counseling to all women in the reproductive age group before and after cardiac transplantation. Reliable contraception is vital as nearly half of the pregnancies in this population are unintended. Despite the associated risks, successful pregnancies after cardiac transplantation have been reported. A multidisciplinary approach proposed in this review is essential for successful outcomes. A checklist for providers to guide management is provided. 'Cardiac transplantation; immunosuppression; preconception counseling; acute rejection; contraception'
