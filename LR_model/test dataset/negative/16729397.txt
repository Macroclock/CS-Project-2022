Long-term follow up after coronary sirolimus drug-eluting stent implantation for cardiac transplant arteriopathy. There has been limited published experience with the use of sirolimus drug-eluting stents in the setting of cardiac transplant vasculopathy. Systemic sirolimus has been shown to protect against progressive transplant vasculopathy, and sirolimus-eluting stents have shown to reduce the risk of in-stent restenosis in native coronary arteries. We report a case of acute myocardial infarction in the setting of advanced transplant vasculopathy, and describe the long-term results of sirolimus drug-eluting stent implantation.
