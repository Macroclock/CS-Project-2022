Use of sildenafil in heart transplant recipients with pulmonary hypertension may prevent right heart failure. We performed a short-term outcome analysis of orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) treated perioperatively with oral sildenafil. PH (pulmonary vascular resistance > 2.5 Wood units, and/or transpulmonary gradient > 12 mmHg) was diagnosed in 6 of 25 (group A) heart transplant recipients operated in 2006. This group of patients underwent a modified medication protocol including perioperative administration of oral sildenafil: 50 mg before followed by 50 or 25 mg TID after heart transplantation. Sildenafil treatment was discontinued 10 to 14 days post OHT, after stepwise dose reduction. During the ICU stay all patients underwent circulatory monitoring of pulmonary and systemic pressures and resistance as well as transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) evaluation. Perioperative oral sildenafil administration in PH patients undergoing OHT was associated with good short-term outcomes in the majority of transplanted patients (4/6). Sildenafil treatment reduced pulmonary resistance and pressures with a low rate of hemodynamic instability among OHT patients. Pharmacologic perioperative reduction of PH improves the short-term prognosis for successful OHT. One may speculate whether sildenafil treatment transplant recipients with PH would be associated with long-term improvement of pulmonary vascular status, therefore leading to extended life-expectancy and improved outcomes.
