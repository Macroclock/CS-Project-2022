Safety and efficacy of ibutilide in heart transplant recipients. In this report we describe our experience with ibutilide, a relatively new Class III anti-arrhythmic agent, in 8 heart transplant patients with supraventricular tachycardia in various settings (3 patients with rejection, 2 after endomyocardial biopsy). Ibutilide treatment was successful in all patients, with the arrhythmia recurring early in 1 patient. There were no complications.
