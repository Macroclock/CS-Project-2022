Anesthetic and Perioperative Considerations for Combined Heart-Kidney Transplantation. To describe detailed perioperative features of combined heart and kidney transplant (HKT). Retrospective study. Tertiary care university hospital. All consecutive HKT recipients aged 18 years and older. None. After approval of the Institutional Review Board, the authors studied all consecutive adult patients who underwent HKT between January 2013 and July 2016. Recipient and donor's demographic data, hemodynamic profile, and perioperative data were analyzed. Actuarial survival rate was 57% and 43% for in-hospital and after a mean follow-up of 135 (266) days, respectively. Among patients who required postoperative hemodialysis (n = 4), 75% (n = 3) died during hospital stay. In unadjusted analysis, patients who died had a lower postoperative cardiac index (5.4 [2.7] v 3.2 [1] L/min/m Anesthesiologists should be actively involved in perioperative strategies on how to manage these critical patients with severe cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities applying their expertise to HKT procedure.
