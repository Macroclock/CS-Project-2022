Reversible bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia associated with FK506. A 50 year old man developed tonic-clonic seizures while receiving cyclosporin A after orthotopic cardiac transplant. The seizures resolved after cessation of cyclosporin A. Thirteen months later, he developed diplopia from bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia while receiving intravenous FK506. A temporal association was found between his symptoms and the serum FK506 concentrations. Withdrawal of the intravenous FK506 led to prompt resolution of the bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia.
