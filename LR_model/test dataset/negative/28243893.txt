Successful management of antibody-mediated rejection after cardiac transplantation in a patient supported by a left ventricular assist device for more than 3Â years. Due to donor shortage, patients with refractory heart failure need to be supported on mechanical circulatory support (MCS). Critically, patients undergo several deployments of MCS in stages inevitably requiring blood products transfusion. MCSs per se along with blood products can trigger immune allosensitization. Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is associated with significant mortality after heart transplantation. Here, we present the case with high panel-reactive antibody over 95% who developed AMR early after heart transplantation. This life-threatening complication was successfully treated with multi-modal treatment including anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab.
