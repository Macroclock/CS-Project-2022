CXCR4 Antagonist Reduced the Incidence of Acute Rejection and Controlled Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy in a Swine Heart Transplant Model Receiving a Mycophenolate-based Immunosuppressive Regimen. CXC motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) blockade is pursued as an alternative to mesenchymal stem cell treatment in transplantation based on our previous report that burixafor, through CXCR4 antagonism, mobilizes immunomodulatory mesenchymal stem cells. Here, we explored the efficacy of combining mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)-based immunosuppressants with repetitive burixafor administration. Swine heterotopic cardiac allograft recipients received MMF and corticosteroids (control, n = 10) combined with burixafor as a 2-dose (burixafor2D, n = 7) or 2-dose plus booster injections (burixafor2D + B, n = 5) regimen. The efficacy endpoints were graft survival, freedom from first acute rejection, and the severity of intimal hyperplasia. Each specimen was sacrificed either at its first graft arrest or after 150 days. After 150 days, all specimens in the control group had died, but 28.5% of the burixafor2D group survived, and 60% of the burixafor2D + B group survived (P = 0.0088). Although the control group demonstrated acute rejection at a median of 33.5 days, the burixafor2D + B group survived without acute rejection for a median of 136 days (P = 0.0209). Burixafor administration significantly attenuated the incidence rate of acute rejection (P = 0.002) and the severity of intimal hyperplasia (P = 0.0097) at end point relative to the controls. These findings were associated with reduced cell infiltrates in the allografts, and modulation of C-reactive protein profiles in the circulation. The augmentation of conventional MMF plus corticosteroids with a CXCR4 antagonist is potentially effective in improving outcomes after heart transplantation in minipigs. Future studies are warranted into optimizing the therapeutic regimens for humans.
