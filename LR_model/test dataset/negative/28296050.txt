A heart within a heart. A 44-year-old man with a history of end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy status-post orthotopic cardiac transplant 14 years ago presented for coronary angiography in preparation for re-operative tricuspid valve replacement. Coronary angiography revealed an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery, with a common coronary trunk arising from the right coronary cusp and bifurcating into right and left main coronary arteries. Interestingly, the right and left coronary arteries coursed to form the shape of a heart, hence, a heart within a heart! Â© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
