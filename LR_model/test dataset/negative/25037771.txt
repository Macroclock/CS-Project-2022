Centers for Disease Control "high-risk" donor status does not significantly affect recipient outcome after heart transplantation in children. In 2004, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) added the label "high-risk donor" (HRD) for any organ donor who met the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria for high-risk behavior for infection. The aim of this study was to calculate the rate of HRD graft use in heart transplantation in children and determine the differences in outcome from those who received standard-risk donor (SRD) grafts. We reviewed information from the UNOS database regarding transplants performed between June 30, 2004 and July 31, 2012. Heart transplant recipients <18 years old were divided into two groups based on the donor's risk status. Demographic data on donors and recipients were collected. Survival analysis was performed to compare survival based on donor status. We also compared episodes of rejection before hospital discharge and the length of stay after transplantation by donor status. During the study period, 2,782 pediatric heart transplantations were performed and 116 (4.1%) patients received a CDC HRD graft. Recipients of HRD grafts were significantly older and heavier than those who received an SRD graft (8.5 vs 6.5 years, p < 0.001 and 35.7 vs 26.9 kg, p < 0.001). There was no difference in patient survival (log rank, p = 0.88) between groups. There was no difference in rejection prior to discharge (17.2 vs 16.4%, p = 0.81) or length of stay after transplantation (26.1 vs 27.6 days, p = 0.58). CDC HRD graft status does not appear to significantly affect recipient outcome after heart transplantation in children.
