[Effect of cyclosporine and simulect mono and combination therapy on cardiac allo-transplantation in rats]. To observe the effect of cyclosporine and simulect mono or combination therapy on cardiac allo-transplantation in rats. Recipients with allografts were treated with different doses of cyclosporine and/or simulect after cardiac allo-transplantation. Graft survival time was observed; the histopathological examination of graft tissues was performed; and levels of serum IL-2 and IL-4 were determined. Mono or combination therapy with cyclosporine and/or simulect increased the survival of cardiac allografts. With the prolongation of survival time of the grafts, the rejection of grafts was moderated. The serum IL-2 level increased in acute rejected grafts; the serum IL-4 level increased evidently in long survival grafts. Cyclosporine and simulect have an effect in the prolongation of cardiac allograft survival in rats, and the combination therapy shows an evident synergistic effect.
