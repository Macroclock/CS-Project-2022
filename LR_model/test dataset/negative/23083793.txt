Primary graft dysfunction does not lead to increased cardiac allograft vasculopathy in surviving patients. Early injury is associated with the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy in heart transplantation. We examined whether adult heart transplant recipients surviving primary graft dysfunction were more susceptible to the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy than their nonprimary graft dysfunction counterparts. A total of 857 patients who underwent heart transplantation between January 1994 and December 2008 at our institution were reviewed. Primary graft dysfunction was defined as the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, open chest, or intra-aortic balloon pump placement within 72 hours of transplantation. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy was defined as â‰¥50% coronary artery stenosis in any vessel. Allograft survival was defined by patient death or need for retransplantation. Completed follow-up was available for 32 patients in the primary graft dysfunction group and 701 patients in the nonprimary graft dysfunction group. Mean recipient ages (56 years vs 55 years, respectively; P = .50) and ischemic times (220 minutes vs 208 minutes, respectively; P = .35) were similar. Donor age was significantly higher in the primary graft dysfunction group (38 years vs 32 years, P = .02). Five-year survivals for the primary graft dysfunction and nonprimary graft dysfunction groups were 46.9% versus 78.9% (P < .001). Conditional 5-year survivals in patients surviving the first year were 78.9% and 88.3% for the primary graft dysfunction and nonprimary graft dysfunction groups, respectively (P = .18). Within a 30-day postoperative period, there were more deaths in the primary graft dysfunction group (28.1% vs 2.3%, P < .0001) and more retransplants (6.25% vs 0%, P = .002). Of the patients surviving past 30 days, only 2 (8.7%) of the primary graft dysfunction patients developed cardiac allograft vasculopathy versus 144 (21.0%) in the nonprimary graft dysfunction group (P < .001). Primary graft dysfunction was associated with lower 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year allograft survival rates. Surviving patients, however, did not show increased tendency toward cardiac allograft vasculopathy development.
