[Outcome post orthotopic heart transplantation for patients with end-stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]. To investigate the outcome of orthotopic heart transplantation for patient with end-stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This retrospective review analyzed the clinical data of nine patients (7 males) undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation for end-stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in our center. All patients received induced therapy protocols peri-operative and standard triple maintenance immunosuppressive therapy postoperative. One recipients developed acute renal failure due to renal artery embolism and allograft rejection in the early posttransplantive course, symptoms and signs were improved under continuous renal replacement therapy and steroid-pulse therapy, this patient died of sudden cardiac arrest at 32 months post transplantation. Another recipient developed demyelinating disease in frontal and parietal lobe and finally recovered with medical therapy. Eight patients survived the operation with good quality of life and there was no episode of rejection or infection or chronic graft arteriosclerosis during follow-up time. Three recipients developed left ventricular hypertrophy and there were no signs of grapg-vessel diseases in the survivals. Heart transplantation is the best therapeutic option for selected patients with end-stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
