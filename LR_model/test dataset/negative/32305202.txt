Procalcitonin Kinetics After Heart Transplantation and as a Marker of Infection in Early Postoperative Course. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker of systemic infection. Specificity of PCT is decreased because PCT is also elevated after heart transplantation (HTx). There is no established normal range of serum PCT concentrations after HTx yet. Our aim was to determine the course of PCT concentrations in patients after HTx in the early postoperative period, if we can discriminate postoperative increase in values from infectious complications. Of 39 patients we diagnosed infection in 11. These patients develop acute kidney injury significantly more often than in control group (group C) (5 in infection group [group I] and 2 in group C, P < .05), and 1 patient died within 30 days in group C. Seven patients developed primary graft dysfunction (3/4 + ECMO [extracorporeal membrane oxygenation], respectively, group I/group C) and 2 neurologic disorders in group I. Reoperation due to bleeding was 3 in each group. During the 14 days after HTx, serum PCT concentrations increased with maximum on the second postoperative day (group C: 30.6 ± 15.3 ng/mL; group I: 24.9 ± 44.3 ng/mL). Normal values for PCT were reached on day 8 in group C and 11 in group I. Mean PCT levels were similar: 8.7 ± 5.7 ng/mL vs 11.9 ± 13.1 ng/mL in group I vs group C, respectively. Patients in group I stayed longer in the intensive care unit. Despite increase in serum concentration of PCT in early postoperative course after HTx there is no marker of infection. Trends in PCT serum concentration may be a valuable tool in diagnosis of infection in patients after HTx, but further investigation is needed.
