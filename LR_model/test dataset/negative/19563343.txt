Lack of effect of MICA antibodies on graft survival following heart transplantation. Little is known about the effect of MICA antibodies (Abs) on cardiac allograft function and survival. Pretransplant and posttransplant serum from 491 and 196 adult cardiac allograft recipients, respectively, has been investigated for MICA Abs, donor specificity and the effect of MICA Abs on graft survival, acute rejection episodes (AR) and cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). Patients with HLA Abs (11.6%) were excluded from the analysis. A total of 11.8% of patients had MICA Abs, without HLA Abs, before their transplant. Actuarial graft survival demonstrated slightly better survival of patients with donor-specific MICA Abs at 1 and 5 years (88.9% and 83.3%) than patients negative for MICA Abs (72% and 63.7%, p = 0.051). After transplantation, 15.8% of patients produced MICA Abs, and in 17 patients these were produced de novo. There was no effect of pretransplant or posttransplant production of MICA Abs on numbers of AR episodes in year 1, or CAV assessed at years 3 and 5. Immunocytochemistry of cardiac biopsies from 11 patients did not demonstrate a presence of MICA. Sera from only 4/69 patients with MICA Abs fixed complement prior to transplantation and from 7/38 patients following transplantation. In conclusion, this study suggests that MICA Abs do not adversely affect the outcome of cardiac transplantation.
