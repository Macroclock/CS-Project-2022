Assessment of cyclosporine pharmacokinetic parameters to facilitate conversion from C0 to C2 monitoring in heart transplant recipients. Cyclosporine (CsA) 2-hour postdose (C2) monitoring is recommended to assess CsA exposure and predict clinical outcomes among heart transplant recipients. We correlated pharmacokinetic parameters and clinical outcomes in stable long-term heart transplant recipients monitored with C0 to develop an algorithm to convert patients from C0 to C2 monitoring. Paired CsA C0-C2 measurements and serum creatinine levels were obtained from 35 heart transplant recipients more than 2 years posttransplantation (mean 8.8+/-4.7 years). The mean CsA dose and C0, C2, and C0/C2 ratio were 85+/-23 mg/12 hours, 123+/-41 ng/mL, 572+/-274 ng/mL and 4.8+/-2.1, respectively. C0 correlated weakly with C2 (r=.42, P=.011). The CsA dose correlated better with C2 (r=.58; P<.001) than with C0 (r=.37; P=.026). A good correlation was noted between C2 and the C2/C0 ratio (r=.73; P<.001), but none between C0 and the C2/C0 ratio. A borderline significant inverse correlation was noted between C0 and the worst endomyocardial biopsy score (r=-.34; P=.045), whereas none was noted with C2. Serum creatinine level did not correlate with either C2 or C0. Among patients with C0 within our target of 100 to 150 ug/L, six had C2 above 300 to 600 ug/L as suggested by the literature. In long-term heart transplant recipients, we could not identify a single pharmacokinetic parameter that could be used to develop an algorithm to convert from C0 to C2 monitoring; however, C2 may be better than C0 for identifying patients at risk of overexposure to CsA.
