Novel Biomarker Approaches for Managing Patients With Cardiac Transplantation. Despite major advances in the medical care of patients following heart transplantation (HTx) and a steady increase in long-term survival, allograft surveillance is still based on endomyocardial biopsy, the gold standard since the 1970s. This invasive procedure calls for less burdening and more cost-effective approaches. In recent years, impressive progress has been made in utilizing blood-based biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of diseases in a variety of fields. Hence, a number of trials have been performed testing the usefulness of circulating molecules or other technical methods to overcome the need for surveillance myocardial biopsy in HTx patients. Here, we review current approaches and the state of research on novel biomarkers for the management of patients following heart transplantation.
