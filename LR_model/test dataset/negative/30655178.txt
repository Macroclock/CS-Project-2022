Mitochondrial integrity during early reperfusion in an isolated rat heart model of donation after circulatory death-consequences of ischemic duration. Cardioprotection and graft evaluation after ischemia-reperfusion (IR) are essential in facilitating heart transplantation with donation after circulatory death. Given the key role of mitochondria in IR, we aimed to investigate the tolerance of cardiac mitochondria to warm, global ischemia and to determine the predictive value of early reperfusion mitochondria-related parameters for post-ischemic cardiac recovery. Isolated, working rat hearts underwent 0, 21, 24, 27, 30, or 33 minutes of warm, global ischemia, followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Functional recovery (developed pressure × heart rate) was determined at 60 minutes of reperfusion, whereas mitochondrial integrity was measured at 10 minutes of reperfusion. Functional recovery at 60 minutes of reperfusion decreased with ≥ 27 minutes of ischemia vs no ischemia (n = 7-8/group; p < 0.01). Cytochrome c, succinate release, and mitochondrial Ca Mitochondrial dysfunction occurs with shorter periods of ischemia than cardiac dysfunction. Mitochondrial coupling, ROS emission from reverse electron transfer, and calcium retention are particularly sensitive to early reperfusion injury, reflecting potential targets for cardioprotection. Indicators of mitochondrial integrity may be of aid in evaluating suitability of donation after circulatory death grafts for transplantation.
