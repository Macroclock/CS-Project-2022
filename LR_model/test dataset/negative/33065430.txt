Trisomy 3, a sole recurrent cytogenetic abnormality in pediatric polymorphic post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Trisomy 3 has been previously reported in association with T-cell lymphomas and less commonly in different types of non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas. Trisomy 3 has also been reported in two cases of pediatric post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). We present comprehensive clinicopathologic review of two pediatric patients with cardiac and liver/intestinal allografts that developed polymorphic PTLD characterized by trisomy 3. Both patients had Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia and EBV was positive in tissue by EBER in situ hybridization. Using karyotype analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we identified trisomy 3 in both patients. Both patients responded to treatment and are now free of the PTLD. Trisomy 3, an uncommon cytogenetic finding in pediatric polymorphic PTLD, may be a recurrent cytogenetic aberration if confirmed in a larger study of pediatric PTLDs. Further clinical follow up might help stratify significance of trisomy 3 as a prognostic factor. 'Cytogenetics', 'Pediatric PTLD', 'Recurrent', 'Transplantation', 'Trisomy 3'
