Late graft dysfunction after pediatric heart transplantation is associated with fibrosis and microvasculopathy by automated, digital whole-slide analysis. Histopathologic features of late graft dysfunction (LGD) in endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) after pediatric heart transplantation (HT) have been incompletely described and rarely quantified. We employed automated, morphometric analysis of whole-slide EMB images to objectively quantify fibrosis and microvasculopathy after pediatric HT. Nine recipients with clinical LGD were matched with controls on age, listing diagnosis, crossmatch and time since HT. Fibrosis was quantified as percent tissue area with fibrosis and capillary density as capillaries per unit area, number of capillary "neighbors" within 30 Î¼m of each myocyte and myocyte-to-nearest-capillary diffusion distance. Clinical data, including all EMB reports, were also reviewed. The groups were well matched for age at HT (median 4.0 vs 3.1 years), listing diagnosis (50% congenital heart disease for each), positive crossmatch (11% each) and days post-HT (2,628 vs 2,894, p = 0.69). Despite a similar number of previous EMBs (median 23 each, p = 0.43), areas occupied by fibrosis were greater in LGD cases (44.5% vs 23.2%, p = 0.012). Capillary number/area data were not statistically different between LGD cases and controls (378/mm LGD after pediatric HT is associated with previous rejection and characterized histologically by fibrosis and microvasculopathy, which are not readily appreciated by traditional semi-quantitative EMB analysis. Software-assisted EMB analysis may enable greater pathophysiologic understanding of LGD and identification of targets for future study and intervention.
