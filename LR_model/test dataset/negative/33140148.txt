Association between infectious event and de novo malignancy after heart transplantation. The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence of and risk factors for de novo malignancy after heart transplantation (HTx) in a single center. We assessed 102 consecutive patients who received HTx and were followed-up in our center regularly for > 1 year from June 2006 to May 2018. We investigated the incidence of and risk factors for de novo malignancy. The cumulative incidence of each malignancy type during the follow-up period was one (0.98%) for skin cancer, four (3.92%) for nonskin solid organ cancer, and six (5.88%) for posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). The percentage of patients with more than one infectious event ≤ 1 year after HTx was higher in the malignancy group than in the non-malignancy group. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the incidence rate of infectious events was higher in patients with malignancies than in those without (log-rank P < 0.001). After dividing malignancies into a PTLD group and a solid organ malignancy group, we found that negative Epstein-Barr virus serostatus, cytomegalovirus-positive antigenemia, and the occurrence of any viral or gastrointestinal infectious event at ≤ 1 year were more frequent in patients with PTLD than in patients without it. The survival rate was significantly lower for patients with solid organ malignancy than for patients without malignancy. In conclusion, there was a correlation between infectious events and de novo malignancy, particularly in patients with PTLD. We should confirm this finding by conducting a larger cohort study.
