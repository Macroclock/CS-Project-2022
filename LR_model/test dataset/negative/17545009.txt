Echocardiography in the cardiac transplant recipient. Despite the widespread use of echocardiography in the cardiac allograft recipient, the clinical usefulness of this practice is not well defined. In this article, the authors review the spectrum of echocardiographic findings in the adult heart transplant patient. Appreciation of typical alterations from "normal" allows the transplant physician to identify clinically significant changes and to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures based on misinterpretation of these differences. Though abnormalities of systolic and diastolic function correlate with episodes of acute rejection, the primary diagnostic usefulness of echocardiography in acute rejection is guiding the endomyocardial biopsy. Additionally, echocardiography has found a role as a supplement to invasive angiography in the diagnosis of cardiac allograft vasculopathy.
