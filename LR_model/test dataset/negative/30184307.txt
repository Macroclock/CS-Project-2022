Successful treatment of giant condyloma in a pediatric heart transplant recipient with topical cidofovir. We report a case of giant condyloma that developed in a pediatric heart transplant recipient. This infection progressed for several months despite reduction in immunosuppression, topical treatment, and oral cimetidine therapy. Complete resolution was observed following 7Â months of topical cidofovir, without evidence of systemic toxicity or rejection.
