Manifestations of health anxiety in patients with heart transplant. Health anxiety is an important component of psychological adjustment to chronic medical conditions. However, it has been overlooked after heart transplantation. To examine demographic, clinical, and psychological correlates of health anxiety in heart transplanted patients and to compare health anxiety between patients and a sample of matched controls from the general population. The study design was observational. Seventy-three cardiac recipients and 73 controls completed the Illness Attitude Scales and the Symptom Questionnaire. Patients' clinical parameters were collected. Health anxiety was significantly associated with clinical variables suggesting a worse outcome, especially a higher NYHA class and occurrence of cancer. Compared to controls, patients had significantly more "hypochondriacal responses" (32.9% vs. 16.4%), an index of clinically significant health anxiety. Health anxiety affects a significant subset of heart transplanted patients and deserves a thorough assessment. Cardiologists' and nurses' specific communication skills and psychological treatment strategies may be necessary.
