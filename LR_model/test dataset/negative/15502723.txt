TNP-470, an angiogenesis inhibitor, attenuates the development of allograft vasculopathy. Fischer 344 rat recipients of Lewis allografts were treated with TNP-470, a synthetic fumagillin derivative and a well-established angiogenesis inhibitor. TNP-470 alone resulted in some prolongation of graft survival as compared with untreated recipients, but all grafts ultimately failed. In contrast, treatment with cyclosporine (CsA) from day 0 to 30 resulted in prolonged graft survival and marked cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) by histology (mean score 2.28+/-0.2). There were many neovessels within the intima of CAV lesions. When TNP-470 was administered in combination with CsA from day 0 to 30, the degree of CAV was similar to that with CsA alone (mean score 2.22+/-0.26). However, when TNP-470 was administered from day 30 to 120 after discontinuation of CsA, there was a marked reduction in the degree of CAV (mean score 1.08+/-0.11). Therefore, TNP-470 interrupts the progression of CAV when given late but does not prevent its development when given immediately posttransplantation.
