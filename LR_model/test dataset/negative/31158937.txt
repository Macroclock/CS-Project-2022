Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for cerebral air gas embolism following orthotopic heart transplant: case report. Air gas embolism (AGE) is a rare complication of cardiac surgery, with high morbidity and mortality. We present a case of suspected AGE following orthotopic heart transplant. The patient received hyperbaric oxygen therapy with near-complete resolution of symptoms at follow-up. This case exemplifies the difficulty in diagnosis of AGE, the considerations involved in the treatment of a critical care patient in a hyperbaric chamber, and utility in treating a patient for AGE even after a delay in diagnosis.
