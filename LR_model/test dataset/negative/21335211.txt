The clinical risk in heart transplantation: is it evaluable? At the moment, there is no score to evaluate clinical risk in heart transplantation. There is a need for such an instrument due to the extended criteria for donations and for recipient evaluation for transplantation. We divided the 203 consecutive patients who underwent heart transplantation (HTx). Between January 1999 and December 2007 into two groups: high and low risk based on several common well-defined variables. Donors were also divided into high- and low-risk groups. We matched the four groups to obtain risk cohorts: GA (high risk), GB and GC (intermediate risk) versus GD (low risk). We analyzed the 30 day-mortality showing a significant difference between GD and the other groups (P = .05) in contrast to no significant difference in 1- and 3-year survival rates among GA, GB, GC, and GD. Although the development of a specific score for heart transplantation is desirable and would be useful, a careful, case-by-case evaluation is indispensable.
