Translating transplantation tolerance in the clinic: where are we, where do we go? Research networks dedicated to translation of immune tolerance in the clinic currently support pilot trials aiming at immunosuppression withdrawal in kidney or liver allograft recipients. Although results obtained so far indicate that significant hurdles still need to be overcome before organ transplant recipients can be weaned off drugs safely and routinely, recent advances suggest that immunosuppression minimization on the basis of validated biomarkers might become standard practice in a near future.
