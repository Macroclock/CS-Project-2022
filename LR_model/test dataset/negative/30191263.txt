Health-related quality of life in adult heart-transplant recipients-a systematic review. Health-related quality of life is a multidimensional concept to assess the impact of medical interventions from an individual perspective. This concept is important to evaluate benefits of heart transplantation. This systematic review was conducted to determine (1) posttransplant health-related quality of life in heart transplantation patients and (2) influencing factors of health-related quality of life. A systematic review of cross-sectional, prospective and mixed methods studies published from November 2007 to November 2017 was conducted on PsycINFO, PSYNDEX and PubMed using a combination of the keywords heart transplantation, heart transplantation patient, quality of life, and health-related quality of life. A total of 14 studies with a cross-sectional design, 6 studies with a prospective design and 2 mixed-methods studies were identified. The stability of health-related quality of life up to 10 years after transplantation has been reported. Most often generic scales, such as SF-36 (8) and WHOQoL-BREF (7) were used for data collection. Demoralization, depression, pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, sexual dysfunction, and poor oral health influence health-related quality of life negatively, whereas social and family support have a positive impact. Although health-related quality of life is positively influenced by transplantation, further research regarding gender differences is needed. Disease-specific scales were rarely used.
