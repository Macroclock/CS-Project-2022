Valve-related events after aortic root replacement with cryopreserved aortic homografts. Aortic root replacement with aortic homografts for various pathologic conditions involving the aortic root has yielded good early results. To assess mid-term valve-related events, a follow-up study was conducted. From February 1989 through January 2003, 213 patients with a mean age of 51.3 +/- 11.8 years underwent aortic root replacement with a cryopreserved aortic homograft. Bacterial endocarditis (58.7%) was the predominant indication for surgery (native valve endocarditis, n = 73; prosthetic valve endocarditis, n = 52). Of the 197 hospital survivors, 194 were entered in the follow-up study (98.5% complete). Endpoints of the study were death, valve-related death, reoperation for valve failure, endocarditis, thromboembolic events, and anticoagulant-related bleeding events. Follow-up was conducted between February and April 2003. Overall hospital mortality was 7.5% (n = 16; 70% confidence limits, 5.6% to 9.4%). Mean follow-up was 5.8 years (range, 0.3 to 14.3). In total, 20 late deaths occurred (10.3%); of these, 5 were valve-related. The overall survival at 5 and 10 years is 87.3% +/- 2.4% and 70.8% +/- 5.3%, respectively. Twenty-one patients (10.8%) required reoperation, either for structural valve deterioration (n = 12), false aneurysm (n = 3), endocarditis of the homograft (n = 3), or for other reason (n = 3). Mortality for reoperation was 28.6% (n = 6). Five-year and 10-year freedom from reoperation is 94.5% +/- 1.8% and 76.4% +/- 5.3%, respectively. Endocarditis of the homograft was reported in 4 patients (3.2%), of whom 1 patient was treated medically and 3 required reoperation. Thromboembolic events (n = 1) and anticoagulant-related bleeding events (n = 0) were rarely seen. A recent echocardiographic study was available in 124 patients (71.3%). Aortic regurgitation grade I to II was reported in 121 patients (97.6%). Cryopreserved aortic homografts function well on mid-term evaluation. The incidence of structural valve failure is acceptable. Reoperations for homograft endocarditis carry a high mortality rate.
