Succesful treatment of a severe case of rhabdomyolysis following heart transplantation by hemoadsorption. Patients after heart transplantation are often showing a variety of different perioperative complications causing an impaired outcome. Rhabdomyolysis can be caused by several reasons such as limb ischemia or myocardial damage and become a trigger for kidney injury. Chronic renal failure with the need for hemodialysis remains a common problem after transplantation and impacts post-transplant survival. We describe the successful treatment of a patient with severe rhabdomyolysis following heart transplantation by the usage of hemoadsorption.
