Effects of immunoglobulin to prevent coronary allograft vasculopathy in heart transplantation. Although 100,000 cardiac transplants have been performed, coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV), which is a phenomenon of chronic rejection, is still a serious problem. Several adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines play a critical role in the process. Recent investigations have proved some promising methodologies for preventing or treating rejection. Although immunoglobulins are known to be an effective treatment in many diseases, their effect on cardiac transplantation or CAV is to be elucidated. In this review article, we described some promising methodologies that use immunoglobulins to prevent CAV. Immunoglobulins may be used to prevent CAV.
