Experimental heterotopic heart transplantation: an easier technique. The use of heterotopic heart transplantation (HHT) in experimental surgery is an extended method to evaluate cardiac graft viability. To study endothelial injury after ischemia-reperfusion, the technique described by Matsui et al. in 1988 for HHT was chosen. A modification, which consists of replacing the atrium-to-atrium anastomosis for the tip of a 30-Fr venous cannula, was developed with the purpose of using this technique in small pigs. Both techniques were compared. Twenty-seven consecutive HHTs in 17- to 20-kg pigs using Matsui's original technique and the modified technique were performed. Ischemia time, bleeding volume, mean gradient and anastomosis complications were measured to compare both techniques. Statistically significant decreases in ischemia time, bleeding volume and mean gradient with the modified technique were found. Furthermore, there were two cases of suture dehiscence with the original technique. The replacement of the atrium-to-atrium anastomosis for the venous cannula is a modification that statistically decreases the ischemia time, blood loss and avoids suture complications. This modification makes Matsui's technique easier, faster and safer in small pigs and it may be used in bigger animals and in any kind of non-permanent anastomosis.
