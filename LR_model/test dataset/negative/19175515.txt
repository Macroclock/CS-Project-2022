BK virus nephropathy in the native kidneys of a pediatric heart transplant recipient. BK virus is a human polyoma virus that may cause nephropathy in immunosuppressed patients. It is a well-recognized cause of renal allograft dysfunction and allograft loss in renal transplant recipients, but it is an infrequent cause of nephropathy outside this setting. There are a few case reports of BK virus nephropathy in the native kidneys of immunosuppressed adult patients with non-renal transplants, but so far it has not been reported in pediatric non-renal solid organ transplant recipients. We report a case of a seven-yr-old heart transplant patient who was diagnosed with BK virus nephropathy, eight months after his second heart transplant. Despite intervention, his renal dysfunction progressed to renal failure. He is currently receiving maintenance hemodialysis and awaiting renal transplantation. It is important to recognize BK virus infection as a possible cause of renal dysfunction in immunosuppressed children who are non-renal transplant recipients.
