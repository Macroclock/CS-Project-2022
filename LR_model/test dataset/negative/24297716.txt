Treatment of a primary cardiac lymphoma with orthotopic heart transplantation. We here describe the case of a patient diagnosed with primary lymphoma who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation.Post surgically, the patient was treated with immunosuppressants and chemotherapy. Three months later, lesions were found on the right side of the neck and the inferior vena cava; 12 months later, the lesion of the neck became smaller and the lesion of the inferior vena cava was not detected by positron emission tomography/computed tomography. The problems we encountered with this rare disease are discussed and compared to previous studies.
