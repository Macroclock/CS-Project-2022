Evolution of right cardiac pressures during the first year after heart transplantation. Preoperative pulmonary hypertension is an adverse prognostic factor for early morbidity-mortality after heart transplantation (HT). The persistence of hypertension is likewise associated with a poorer patient prognosis. The present study investigated the evolution of right cardiac pressures in the first year after HT with respect to the background cardiac disease. This study of 60 consecutive patients subjected to HT analyzed the baseline clinical characteristics and mean right atrial and right ventricle systolic and diastolic pressures in a pre-HT study and during biopsies performed in the first 2 weeks as well as at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after transplantation. The study excluded retransplantations, heart and lung transplantations, and pediatric patients, as well as patients not subjected to biopsy because of early mortality. The mean patient age was 50 years (83% males); 31.7% were diabetics, and 33% showed hypertension. The background heart disease was of ischemic origin in 35% of cases, and consisted of dilated myocardiopathy in 33%, with a mean left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) of 23% and a mean pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 50.1 mm Hg. During the postoperative course, an important decrease versus baseline was observed in right heart pressures as soon as 2 weeks post-HT, with a drop in right ventricle (RV) systolic pressure from 50.3 +/- 13.7 to 42.5 +/- 10.4 mm Hg (P = .013), and a drop in RV diastolic pressure from 17.4 +/- 5.8 to 14.2 +/- 4.1 mm Hg (P = .007). This decreased tendency continued to a more moderate extent to the third month, after which the pressures stabilized. The same behavior was observed in patients with diseases of ischemic origin and in those with dilated myocardiopathy. In our series, right cardiac pressures showed an important decrease in the first days after HT, with stabilization by the third month--though without returning to normal values and without modifications in the first year after transplantation. No differences in this evolutive trend were seen according to the type of background heart disease.
