The Evolution of Mechanical Circulatory Support. The field of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has evolved from earlier-generation pulsatile-flow devices that were primarily used to support critically ill patients in the hospital to newer-generation continuous-flow devices that permit hospital discharge and resumption of normal life activities. The technology is used to bridge transplant-eligible patients and can be used for long-term support of patients who are transplant ineligible. Left ventricular assist devices are proved to improve long-term survival and quality of life for patients with advanced heart failure. Adverse events associated with MCS therapy remain the Achilles heel of the field and strategies to improve biocompatibility are ongoing.
