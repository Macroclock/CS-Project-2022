Use of mechanical circulatory support devices in end-stage heart failure patients. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is the standard therapy for the management of acute or chronic end-stage heart failure. We report on our two-center experience with MCS therapy. Between January 2000 and December 2012, 116 adult patients (mean age 56.8 ± 9.9 years, range: 31 to 76 years) were primarily supported on temporary or long-term ventricular assist devices (VADs) or total artificial hearts (TAHs) at our institutions. Temporary extracorporeal radial VAD support was established in 50 patients (43.1%) (Group A) whereas 66 (56.8%) patients received long-term paracorporeal and intracorporeal VAD or TAH (Group B). LVAD support was established in 63 patients (54.3%), with BVAD/TAH support in 29 (25%). A temporary CentriMag was the only device adopted as an isolated RVAD support, being placed in 24 patients (20.6%). In Group A, the overall mean support time was 10.2 ± 6.6 days (range: 3 to 43 days) and the overall success rate was 55.1% (27 patients). The mean LVAD support time was 357 ± 352.3 days (range: 1 to 902 days) in Group B and 98 ± 82.6 days (range: 8 to 832 days) in BVAD/TAH patients, with success rates of 72.5% (37 patients) and 46.6% (seven patients), respectively. The heart transplantation (Htx) rate for both groups combined was 25.8% (n = 30). The overall one- and five-year survival rates after Htx were 73.3% and 60%, respectively. When a decision to treat with VAD or TAH is made early, either modality can be used as an alternative to Htx, affording comparable early to mid-term outcomes.
