Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma: an unusual presentation of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder in a pediatric patient. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) are a potentially life-threatening complication of immunosuppression in transplant recipients. The majority of cases are Epstein-Barr virus-associated lesions of B cell origin. T cell PTLD is rare, particularly in pediatric patients. We present an unusual case of monomorphic T cell PTLD with features of angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma in an 8-year-old heart transplant patient, presenting with cranial nerve palsy.
