The organ transplant law of Japan--the past, the present, and the future. The Organ Transplant Law of Japan, which regulates organ transplants using brain-dead persons' organs, has a set of extremely severe intention-requirements. It has stagnated, rather than promoted, the organ transplant in Japan for the last 8 years. We believe that the Law should be reformed by making an about-face from the current "opt-in" to the "opt-out" principle.
