Interaction of intraluminal tissue and coronary sinus lead stabilized with stent placement. The aim of our investigation was to examine the intraluminal interaction of the vascular tissue and the implanted coronary sinus lead stabilized with stent on two human hearts removed before transplantation. The coronary sinus lumen was sectioned under operational microscope and opened carefully. The leads and stents were found separately positioned beside each other completely covered by an intact intimal tissue layer. No sign of occluding proliferative tissue was observed. Stent fixation technique and extraction of the CS lead in our cases did not have any particular damaging effect on the vascular system.
