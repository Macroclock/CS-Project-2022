Cardiac Biomarkers in Advanced Heart Failure: How Can They Impact Our Pre-transplant or Pre-LVAD Decision-making. Decision-making in advanced heart failure (HF) is a complex process that involves careful consideration of competing tradeoffs of risks and benefits in regard to heart transplantation (HT) or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement. The purpose of this review is to discuss how biomarkers may affect decision-making for HT or LVAD implantation. N-Terminal probrain natriuretic peptide, soluble suppression of tumorigenicity-2, galectin-3, copeptin, and troponin T levels are associated with HF survival and can help identify the appropriate timing for advanced HF therapies. Patients at risk of right ventricular failure after LVAD implantation can be identified with preimplant biomarkers of extracellular matrix turnover, neurohormonal activation, and inflammation. There is limited data on the adoption of biomarker measurement for decision-making in the allocation of advanced HF therapies. Nonetheless, biomarkers can improve risk stratification and prognostication thereby optimizing patient selection for HT and LVAD implantation.
