Egr-1 in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation in response to allo-antigen. Early growth response factor-1 (Egr-1) plays an important role in regulating multiple factors involved in the progression of vascular lesions. This study examined our hypothesis that Egr-1 plays a critical role in the early stage of chronic cardiac allograft rejection and in the proliferation of the smooth muscle cell response to alloantigen. Antisense Egr-1 oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) was ex vivo gene transfected into the donor hearts from DBA/2 mice, followed by heterotopic allografting into B10.D2 recipients. The allografts were harvested on day 30. Egr-1 and its target molecules, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A, basic fibroblastic growth factor (bFGF), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and nonmuscle myosin heavy chain B (SMemb), were identified immunohistochemically, and the percentage of the lumen occluded by the intima was calculated. For the cell proliferation assay, sensitized T cells were harvested from B10.D2 recipients as stimulator and then added to the SMCs, which were harvested from DBA/2 mouse aorta. Cellular proliferation was measured and Egr-1 and its target gene expression were examined by real-time RT-PCR. Egr-1 and its target genes were expressed in the thickened intima from untreated recipients. Egr-1 antisense ODN inhibited not only Egr-1 expression but also its target genes and significantly suppressed intimal thickening of coronary arteries. Egr-1 antisense ODN also significantly inhibited cell proliferation and expressions of Egr-1 and Egr-1 target genes in a mixed cell culture model. We conclude that Egr-1 plays an important role in the formation of the cardiac allograft vasculopathy responding to alloantigens.
