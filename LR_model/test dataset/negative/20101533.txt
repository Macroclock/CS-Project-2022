1-year left ventricular assist device (LVAD) experience as bridge to heart transplantation in an infant with Bland-White-Garland syndrome.

We describe the first case worldwide of an infant suffering from Bland-White-Garland syndrome successfully treated with a left ventricular assist device (Berlin Heart(R); Excor(R) Pediatric) as a bridge to heart transplantation for a period of more than one year.
