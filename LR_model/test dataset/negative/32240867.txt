Leadless pacing in cardiac transplant recipients: Primary results of a multicenter case experience. About 4.5-20% of patients after heart transplant require pacemaker (PM) implantation. The high infective risk profile and the low probability of pacing dependency make heart-transplanted patients the ideal candidates for a leadless single-chamber PM. We report the first multicenter experience of leadless PM implantation in a series of heart-transplanted patients with a long-term follow-up. Our data confirm the feasibility and acceptable safety of leadless device in this peculiar kind of patients, despite implantation seems to be slightly more challenging with respect to non-transplanted patients. Although more data are required, a leadless single-chamber surveillance PM seems a valuable option for heart-transplanted patients. 'Heart transplantation', 'Leadless pacemaker'
