Exercise training improves ambulatory blood pressure but not arterial stiffness in heart transplant recipients. Hypertension is the most prevalent comorbidity after heart transplantation (HT). Exercise training (ET) is widely recommended as a key non-pharmacologic intervention for the prevention and management of hypertension, but its effects on ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and some mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension have not been studied in this population. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of ET on ABP and arterial stiffness of HT recipients. 40 HT patients, randomized to ET (n = 31) or a control group (n = 9) underwent a maximal graded exercise test, 24-hour ABP monitoring, and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) assessment before the intervention and at a 12-week follow-up assessment. The ET program was performed thrice-weekly and consisted primarily of endurance exercise (40 minutes) at ~70% of maximum oxygen uptake (Vo2MAX). The ET group had reduced 24-hour (4.0 ± 1.4 mm Hg, p < 0.01) and daytime (4.8 ± 1.6 mm Hg, p < 0.01) systolic ABP, and 24-hour (7.0 ± 1.4 mm Hg, p < 0.001) daytime (7.5 ± 1.6 mm Hg, p < 0.001) and nighttime (5.9 ± 1.5 mm Hg, p < 0.001) diastolic ABP after the intervention. The ET group also had improved Vo2MAX (9.7% ± 2.6%, p < 0.001) after the intervention. However, PWV did not change after ET. No variable was changed in the control group after the intervention. The 12-week ET program was effective for reducing ABP but not PWV in heart transplant recipients. This result suggests that endurance ET may be a tool to counteract hypertension in this high-risk population.
