Conversion from long-term AB-5000 to EVAHEART using a combined left thoracotomy and sternotomy approach. Because of the extreme donor shortage in Japan, waiting times for heart transplantation exceed 2Â years. Since 1980s in Japan, device availability has also been an issue, with only a few paracorporeal ventricular assist devices (VADs) available as a bridge to transplantation or recovery. However, two implantable VADs became commercially available in 2011. Given these constraints in our healthcare system, we report a relatively rare case of bridge-to-bridge use of an implanted EVAHEART after having used a paracorporeal AB-5000 support for an extended period of time. We successfully employed a combined left thoracotomy and median sternotomy approach as a conversion technique.
