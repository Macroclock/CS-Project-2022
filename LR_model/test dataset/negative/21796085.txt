Immunology insights into cardiac allograft rejection. Despite long-term complications from chronic immunosuppressive therapy, the phenomenon of chronic rejection is still a limitation in cardiac allograft recipients. In this review, starting from basic immunologic concepts, we analyze the mechanisms involved in rejection following heart transplantation, with particular emphasis on chronic rejection manifested as cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). Etiopathogenesis of CAV and diagnostic imaging studies are also discussed.
