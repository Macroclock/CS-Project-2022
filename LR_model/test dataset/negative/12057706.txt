Successful cardiac transplantation after 4 cases of DeBakey left ventricular assist device failure. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are an established surgical therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. Major disadvantages of these devices are thromboembolic events, bleeding complications, infections, and malfunctions. We report on our experiences with DeBakey LVAD malfunctions requiring LVAD exchange in 4 patients. All patients underwent subsequent cardiac transplantation and are doing well now.
