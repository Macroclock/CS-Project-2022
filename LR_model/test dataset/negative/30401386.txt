VE/VCO The ventilatory efficiency represented cardiovascular, pulmonary, and musculoskeletal performance into an integrate index has been used as long-term and short-term prognostic variables in congestive heart failure. The heart failure patients post heart transplantation, whether the ventilatory efficiency was also normalized is still unknown. This was a cross-sectional study. We measured ventilation to carbon dioxide production slope and oxygen consumption in peak exercise (peak VO There were 51 clinically stable post-heart transplantation patients (age 53 ± 12.4 years; 86.3% were male) at 65.14 ± 41.17 months after transplantation. The ventilation to carbon dioxide production slope was 29.2 ± 5.6, which significantly improved compared to that recorded 1 month after heart transplantation (32.6 ± 6.4). There were 20 patients in the abnormal group, characterized by lower 6-minute walking test distance (normal vs abnormal, 422.5 ± 97.8 vs 532.6 ± 87.6 m) and peak VO Our findings indicate that the ventilation to carbon dioxide production slope is partially abnormal among patients post-heart transplantation. A ventilation to carbon dioxide production slope above the normal range is characterized by a lower peak VO
