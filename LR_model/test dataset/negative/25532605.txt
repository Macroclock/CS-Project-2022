An infant with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest secondary to enteroviral myocarditis surviving up to cardiac transplantation. We report the case of a 13-day-old infant with enteroviral myocarditis surviving an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. She underwent orthotopic cardiac transplantation three months later. A year after the transplantation, she is alive and well. Enteroviral infection is common in neonates with high mortality in cases of enteroviral myocarditis. Cardiac transplantation is a treatment option for infants who fail to recover and remain dependent on inotropic support. This is the first report of an infant with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest secondary to enteroviral myocarditis surviving up to cardiac transplantation.
