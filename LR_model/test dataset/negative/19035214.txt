[Individual immunosuppressive regime in heart transplantation with high risk]. To Summarize the clinical experience of individual immunosuppressive regime in heart transplantation with high risk. From September 2001 to December 2006, 51 cases with the complication of Hepatitis B viruses (HBV) infection, diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction or pulmonary infection in perioperative period were analyzed retrospectively. All cases received daclizumab (Zenapax) induction therapy, and baseline triple immunosuppressive regime was consist of cyclosporine (CsA), azathioprine (Aza) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and prednisone (Pred). Ten cases received HBV infection in preoperative period, the immunosuppressive protocol was emphasized on the use of MMF and the withdraw of Pred one month later in postoperation. Nine cases received diabetes mellitus in pre-operation, 4 cases had post-transplant diabetes mellitus. The immunosuppressive protocol was emphasized on the use of CsA rather than FK506, the use of Pred was less dosage, and the therapy of insulin was necessary. Sixteen cases had renal dysfunction in pre-operation, the use of MMF was routine but the use of CsA was delayed to the time 5 to 19 d postoperative. Twelve cases received pulmonary infection after allograft transplantation. The immunosuppressive agent was to be taped or suspended in therapy time. The liver function of the 10 cases with HBV infection was stable in 1 year follow-up, and 1 case received acute rejection after 13 months allograft transplantation. In the 6 months follow-up, the blood glucose level of the 13 cases with diabetes mellitus was stable, none of the cases suffered from acute rejection. In the one month follow-up, none of the 16 cases with renal dysfunction suffered from acute rejection, and the renal function was normal. Two of the 12 cases with the pulmonary infection were died of serious infection, others were survival. One case received acute rejection on the 17th day in postoperation. Low mortality can be realized by selecting appropriately individual immunosuppressive regime and the episode of acute rejection is rare.
