[Thoracic impedance cardiography in a case of anomalous drainage of the superior vena cava into the coronary sinus]. Thoracic impedance cardiography is a noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring technique based on the physical principal of impedance, which can be defined as resistance to electrical flow. We report the case of a man who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation, during which the superior vena cava was found to drain into the coronary sinus. Impedance cardiography was used because hemodynamics could not be monitored invasively with a Swan-Ganz catheter. We describe the main applications of impedance cardiography and the characteristics of this rare vascular anomaly.
