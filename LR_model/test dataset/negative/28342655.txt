Tacrolimus-Induced Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome with Delayed Multi-Segmental Vasoconstriction. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is a cerebrovascular syndrome characterized by multi-segmental constrictions of the cerebral arteries that resolves spontaneously within 3 months. Although RCVS is considered to be due to transient dysregulation of vascular tone, the exact pathomechanism remains unclear. We describe the case of a 15-year-old girl with RCVS induced by tacrolimus, who developed generalized seizure during the postoperative course of orthotropic heart transplantation. Magnetic resonance imaging at symptom onset showed a few vasoconstrictions accompanying brain edema and convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage. Although her neurological conditions rapidly improved after discontinuing tacrolimus, a repeat magnetic resonance angiogram demonstrated delayed progression of the multi-segmental vasoconstrictions followed by subsequent resolution. Our case demonstrates that cautious observation of the cerebral arteries using magnetic resonance angiography and careful management of vasoconstrictions with vasodilators are necessary for delayed vasoconstrictions even when the clinical symptoms improve.
