New circulatory support system: heartware. Through the new developments in medicine, heart failure therapy has advanced to mechanical circulatory support systems. The HeartWare Ventricular Assist System HVAD; HeartWare, Inc.; Miramar, Fla, USA) is a new device that is a centrifugal, intracorporeal, miniaturized and continuous flow pump that serves simple patient use and enhanced life quality. This article reports the midterm results of patients who underwent the heartware support system. We retrospectively compiled our data from December 2010, including 10 patients of mean age 51.8 years with 90% males, 70% of the overall patient cohort had dilated cardiomyopathy and remaining ones, ischemic disease. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 20.1% and mean systolic pulmonary artery pressure was 49.2 mm Hg. A single patient was grade 1; seven were grade 2; and remaining ones, grade 3 according to the INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) scale. All patients were operated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with moderate hypothermia. Tricuspid ring annuloplasty was performed in 3 (30%) patients. In one patient we removed a left ventricular thrombus. In a case with severe aortic regurgitation, we placed a simple coaptation stitch at the central portion of the three aortic cusps under the aortic cross clamp. The mean CPB duration was 95.5 minutes. There was no operative or in-hospital mortality. Mean support time was 250.67 days. During the early postoperative period, one patient experienced a minor hemorrhagic neurological event also requiring a tracheostomy due to pneumonia. This patient has completely healed and on follow-up continues a normal life. All patients were asymptomatic regarding heart failure. One patient unfortunately died because of possible pancreatic cancer and sepsis. Two patients underwent transplantations on days 159 and 172 of support. The HVAD system provided effective circulatory support for patients with end-stage heart failure with low adverse event rates. Long-term results are needed particularly for destination therapy candidates.
