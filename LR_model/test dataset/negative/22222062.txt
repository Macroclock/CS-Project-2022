[Complications of endomyocardial biopsy after heart transplantation: a lesser evil]. Endomyocardial biopsy is still the principal method for diagnosing cardiac allograft rejection. However, this procedure can be associated, albeit rarely, with potentially serious complications. We describe the case of a patient with extensive anterior myocardial infarction without revascularization, who developed cardiogenic shock and required heart transplantation. Post-transplantation, a coronary artery fistula to the right ventricle associated with an aneurysm and two restrictive ventricular septal defects were detected.
