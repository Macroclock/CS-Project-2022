A Multi-Mode System for Myocardial Functional and Physiological Assessment during Ex Situ Heart Perfusion. Ex situ heart perfusion (ESHP) has proven to be an important and valuable step toward better preservation of donor hearts for heart transplantation. Currently, few ESHP systems allow for a convenient functional and physiological evaluation of the heart. We sought to establish a simple system that provides functional and physiological assessment of the heart during ESHP. The ESHP circuit consists of an oxygenator, a heart-lung machine, a heater-cooler unit, an anesthesia gas blender, and a collection funnel. Female Yorkshire pig hearts (n = 10) had del Nido cardioplegia (4°C) administered, excised, and attached to the perfusion system. Hearts were perfused retrogradely into the aortic root for 2 hours before converting the system to an isovolumic mode or a working mode for further 2 hours. Blood samples were analyzed to measure metabolic parameters. During the isovolumic mode (n = 5), a balloon inserted in the left ventricular (LV) cavity was inflated so that an end-diastolic pressure of 6-8 mmHg was reached. During the working mode (n = 5), perfusion in the aortic root was redirected into left atrium (LA) using a compliance chamber which maintained an LA pressure of 6-8 mmHg. Another compliance chamber was used to provide an afterload of 40-50 mmHg. Hemodynamic and metabolic conditions remained stable and consistent for a period of 4 hours of ESHP in both isovolumic mode (LV developed pressure: 101.0 ± 3.5 vs. 99.7 ± 6.8 mmHg,  'cardioplegia', 'ex situ heart perfusion', 'heart transplant', 'myocardial function'
