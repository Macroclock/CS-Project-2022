Fungal infections in solid organ transplant patients. Solid organ transplantation is becoming increasingly more common in the treatment of end-stage organ failure. Opportunistic fungal infections are a frequent life-threatening complication of transplantation. In this article, a review of the infections in the different organ transplant recipients is presented. The incidence of fungal infections in organ transplant patients ranges from 2% to 50% depending on the type of organ transplanted, kidney recipients being the least frequent and liver recipients having the highest rate of infection. New antifungal medications and immunosuppressants have changed the spectrum of fungal treatment and prevention. Prompt recognition and treatment of infection is imperative for successful therapy. Further advancements in early detection and the development of less toxic medications will lead to refinements in the treatment of fungal infections.
