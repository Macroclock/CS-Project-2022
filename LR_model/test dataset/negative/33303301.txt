Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in heart transplant recipients: Is mortality decreasing? Infection remains a major complication among heart transplant (HT) recipients, causing approximately 20% of deaths in the first year after transplantation. In this population, Aspergillus species can have various clinical presentations including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), which has high mortality (53-78%). To establish the characteristics of IPA infection in HT recipients and their outcomes in our setting. Of 328 heart transplantations performed in our center between 1998 and 2016, five cases of IPA were identified. Patient medical records were examined and clinical variables were extracted. All cases were male, with a mean age of 62 years. The most common indication for HT was nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Productive cough was reported as the main symptom. The imaging assessment was based on chest radiography and chest computed tomography. The most commonly reported radiological abnormality was multiple nodular opacities in both techniques. Bronchoscopy was performed in all patients and A. fumigatus was isolated in four cases on BAL culture. Treatment included amphotericin in four patients, subsequently changed to voriconazole in three patients, and posaconazole in one patient, with total treatment lasting an average of 12 months. Neutropenia was found in only one patient, renal failure was observed in two patients, and concurrent cytomegalovirus infection occurred in three patients. All patients survived after a mean follow-up of 18 months. IPA is a potentially lethal complication after HT. An early diagnosis and prompt initiation of aggressive treatment are the cornerstone for better survival.
