Laparoscopic-Assisted Resection for Advanced Colorectal Cancer in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients. To evaluate the feasibility, short- and long-term outcomes, and safety of laparoscopic resection for advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) in solid organ transplant recipients. Between September 2001 and April 2016, five patients who underwent laparoscopic-assisted resection for CRC after solid organ transplantation were included in this study. Their clinical data were retrospectively analyzed with regard to patient demographics, immunosuppressive therapy, tumor characteristics, surgical outcomes, and follow-up data. Four kidney and one heart transplant recipients were included. Laparoscopic-assisted low anterior resection was performed in four patients with rectal or rectosigmoid junction cancer, and sigmoidectomy was done in one with sigmoid colon cancer. One kidney transplant patient received a protective loop transverse colostomy. All resections achieved complete tumor removal with tumor-free margins and total mesorectal excision, with an average number of 14 lymph nodes harvested. Most tumors were in stage III (n = 3), one was in stage II, and one in stage IV. The mean duration of surgery, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative hospital stay were 144 min, 105 mL, and 8.8 days, respectively. No major complications occurred and graft function stayed well. During a mean follow-up period of 62 months, two patients developed metastasis and died eventually. Laparoscopic resection for advanced CRC in organ transplant recipients is technically feasible and therapeutically safe, and seems to have the advantages of few postoperative complications, short recovery time, and acceptable oncological outcomes.
