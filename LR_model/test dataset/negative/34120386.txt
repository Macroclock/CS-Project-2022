Pediatric heart-liver transplant outcomes in the United States: A 25-year National Cohort Study. Pediatric HLT remains uncommon in the United States and criteria for HLT are unclear. The objectives of this study were to review the indications, and outcomes of pediatric HLT. Data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients heart and liver databases were used to identify 9245 pediatric isolated heart transplants (PHT), 14 134 pediatric isolated liver transplant (PLT), and 20 pediatric HLT (16 patients underwent sHLT [same organ donor] and four patients with a history of PHT followed by PLT [different organ donors]; age ≤21 years) between 1992 and 2017. Outcomes included patient survival, and 1-year rates of acute heart and liver rejection. The median age for pediatric HLT was 15.6 (IQR: 10.5, 17.9) years, and included 12 males (12/20 = 60%). In the HLT group, the most common indication for HT was CHD (12/20 = 60%), and the most common indication for liver transplant was cirrhosis (9/20 = 45%). The 1, 3, and 5 year actuarial survival rates in pediatric simultaneous HLT recipients (n = 16) were 93%, 93%, and 93%, respectively, and was similar to isolated PHT alone (88%, 81%, and 75.5%, respectively and isolated PLT alone (84%, 82%, and 80%), respectively. There was no heart or liver rejection reported in the HLT group versus 9.9% in heart and 10.6% in liver transplant-only groups, respectively. Pediatric HLT is an uncommon but acceptable option for recipients with combined end-organ failure, with intermediate survival outcomes comparable to those of single-organ recipients.
