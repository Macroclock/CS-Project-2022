[Technical possibilities and limitations of mechanical circulatory support]. Ventricular assist devices (VAD) to support the left (LVAD), the right (RVAD) or both ventricles (BVAD) have emerged as one standard of care for advanced heart failure patients. Initially used to bridge patients to transplantation (BTT) they are now more frequently implanted as permanent support (destination therapy, DT). Bridge to recovery (BTR) is a valid option for only a small number of patients. Although there are different devices available, patient selection, preoperative and intraoperative management, and the timing of VAD implantation are the elements critical to successful circulatory support.
