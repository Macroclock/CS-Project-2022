Refining murine heterotopic heart transplantation: A model to study ischemia and reperfusion injury in donation after circulatory death hearts. Heart transplantation is a lifesaving procedure, which is limited by the availability of donor hearts. Using hearts from donors after circulatory death, which have sustained global ischemia, requires thorough studies on reliable and reproducible models that developing researchers may not have mastered. By combining the most recent literature and our recommendations based on observations and trials and errors, the methods here detail a sound in vivo heterotopic heart transplantation model for rats in which protective interventions on the ischemic heart can be studied, and thus allowing the scientific community to advance organ preservation research. Knowledge gathered from reproducible animal models allow for successful translation to clinical studies. 'animal models', 'cardiovascular biology', 'cardiovascular disorders', 'reproducibility'
