Predictors of neuropsychological functioning and medication adherence in pediatric heart transplant recipients referred for neuropsychological evaluation. Children who undergo heart transplantation are at risk for long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae secondary to heart disease and its treatment. Detailed neuropsychological profiles in clinical sample status post-pediatric heart transplantation are sparse in the literature, and there is little information regarding predictors of neuropsychological functioning or how it relates to medication adherence in this population. The present study examined these questions in a retrospective analysis of 27 pediatric heart transplantation recipients referred for clinical neuropsychological evaluation. The sample demonstrated mild-to-moderate decrements across domains of neuropsychological functioning. Children with premorbid congenital heart disease performed more poorly in working memory, word reading, and parent-rated conceptual adaptive skills compared to children with premorbid cardiomyopathy. Additionally, a higher number of rejection episodes were related to poorer verbal memory. Children with parent-reported attention problems had better adherence to immunosuppressant medication, which may have represented greater caregiver involvement in medication management. Taken together, clinically referred children with history of heart transplantation showed broad-based difficulties across neuropsychological domains according to formal testing and parent rating scales. This population requires routine neuropsychological monitoring and intervention. 'adherence', 'neuropsychological functioning', 'pediatric heart transplantation'
