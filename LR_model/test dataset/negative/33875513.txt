Cardiac sarcoidosis in the donor heart without extracardiac manifestations. A middle-aged woman who received heart transplantation for end-stage sarcoid cardiomyopathy developed recurrent cardiac sarcoidosis in the donor heart. She presented 5 years post-transplantation with heart block and systolic dysfunction, without extracardiac involvement. Her disease was unresponsive to corticosteroids. Routine functional imaging may help identify such recurrences. 'heart failure', 'pacing and electrophysiology', 'radiology (diagnostics)', 'transplantation'
