Lower respiratory tract infections in patients during hospital stay after heart transplantation. A retrospective analysis was performed on the records of 95 pts who underwent heart transplantation at Dept. Of Cardiac Surgery & Transplantation in 1999 and 2000 y. In 34 pts lower respiratory tract infections were observed. In all cases bacterial factor was detected in sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage. In study population we analysed influence of such factors as age of the patients, the intensity and duration of immunosuppression, pre-existing diseases and timing after transplantation on the incidence of infection. Most often, in 43 pts gram negative stains bacteria was detected. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15 pts), Acinetobacter baumanii (7 pts) and Enterobacter cloacae (6 pts) were predominant. Gram positive stains bacteria was detected only in two cases (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus). In 1 pt we observed lung tuberculosis and in 2 pts Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Older recipient age was the only risk factor leading to occurrence of respiratory tract infections in patients after heart transplantation.
