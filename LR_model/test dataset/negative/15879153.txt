Absence of recipient CCR5 promotes early and increased allospecific antibody responses to cardiac allografts. Acute rejection is mediated by T cell infiltration of allografts, but mechanisms mediating the delayed rejection of allografts in chemokine receptor-deficient recipients remain unclear. The rejection of vascularized, MHC-mismatched cardiac allografts by CCR5(-/-) recipients was investigated. Heart grafts from A/J (H-2(a)) donors were rejected by wild-type C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) recipients on day 8-10 posttransplant vs day 8-11 by CCR5(-/-) recipients. When compared with grafts from wild-type recipients, however, significant decreases in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and macrophages were observed in rejecting allografts from CCR5-deficient recipients. These decreases were accompanied by significantly lower numbers of alloreactive T cells developing to IFN-gamma-, but not IL-4-producing cells in the CCR5(-/-) recipients, suggesting suboptimal priming of T cells in the knockout recipients. CCR5 was more prominently expressed on activated CD4(+) than CD8(+) T cells in the spleens of allograft wild-type recipients and on CD4(+) T cells infiltrating the cardiac allografts. Rejecting cardiac allografts from wild-type recipients had low level deposition of C3d that was restricted to the graft vessels. Rejecting allografts from CCR5(-/-) recipients had intense C3d deposition in the vessels as well as on capillaries throughout the graft parenchyma similar to that observed during rejection in donor-sensitized recipients. Titers of donor-reactive Abs in the serum of CCR5(-/-) recipients were almost 20-fold higher than those induced in wild-type recipients, and the high titers appeared as early as day 6 posttransplant. These results suggest dysregulation of alloreactive Ab responses and Ab-mediated cardiac allograft rejection in the absence of recipient CCR5.
