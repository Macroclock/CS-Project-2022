Absence of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies after ABO-incompatible heart transplantation in infancy: altered immunity or age? Specific B-cell tolerance toward donor blood group antigens develops in infants after ABO-incompatible heart transplantation, whereas their immune response toward protein antigens such as HLA has not been investigated. We assessed de novo HLA-antibodies in 122 patients after pediatric thoracic transplantation (28 ABO-incompatible) and 36 controls. Median age at transplantation was 1.7 years (1 day to 17.8 year) and samples were collected at median 3.48 years after transplantation. Antibodies were detected against HLA-class I in 21 patients (17.2%), class II in 18 (14.8%) and against both classes in 10 (8.2%). Using single-antigen beads, donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) were identified in six patients (all class II, one additional class I). Patients with DSAs were significantly older at time of transplantation. In patients who had undergone pretransplant cardiac surgeries, class II antibodies were more frequent, although use of homografts or mechanical heart support had no influence. DSAs were absent in ABO-incompatible recipients and class II antibodies were significantly less frequent than in children with ABO-compatible transplants. This difference was present also when comparing only children transplanted below 2 years of age. Therefore, tolerance toward the donor blood group appears to be associated with an altered response to HLA beyond age-related effects.
