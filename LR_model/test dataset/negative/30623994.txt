Pediatric heart transplantation from an influenza B-positive donor. As heart transplantation demand is increasing without subsequent growth of the donor pool, need for expansion of acceptance criteria is paramount, particularly when considering critically ill, highly sensitized patients. We present a case report of a pediatric heart transplant recipient of an organ refused by 197 prior potential recipients due to the donor being infected with influenza virus. We perform a literature review of recent solid organ transplant cases from influenza-positive donors and conclude that the donor pool may be expandable by allowing donors with treatable infections to be included.
