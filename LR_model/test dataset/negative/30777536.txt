Levels of High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein in Heart Transplant Patients With and Without Periodontitis. The outcomes of heart transplantation are very favorable, but inflammation still plays a critical role in deterioration of chronic transplants. Periodontal diseases are not limited to supporting the structures of the teeth, but they also cause systemic inflammation. Based on the importance of inflammation in heart transplant recipients and the association between periodontal disease and systemic inflammation, this study explored whether periodontitis may be a modifier of serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in heart transplant patients. Our study included 33 patients who had heart transplant procedures at the Baskent University Hospital. Clinical periodontal parameters were recorded to assess the periodontal status. On the same day as clinical measurements, blood samples were collected to measure the serum levels of highsensitivity C-reactive protein. Of the 33 heart transplant patients, 9 patients (27.3%) were diagnosed with periodontitis, 4 (12.1%) were periodontally healthy, and 20 (60.6%) had gingivitis. In the group with periodontitis, serum highsensitivity C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher than the periodontally healthy and gingivitis groups (P = .006). In addition, Spearman correlation analyses showed that serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was positively correlated with probing depth (r = 0.358; P = .041), clinical attachment level (r = 0.352; P = .045), and gingival recession (r = 0.422; P = .014). We found that elevated levels of serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in heart transplant patients were associated with periodontitis. Thus, these findings reinforce the need for the inclusion of regular periodontal visits after transplant.
