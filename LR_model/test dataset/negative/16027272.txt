Mechanical device-based methods of managing and treating heart failure. Despite advances in pharmacological treatments aimed at neurohormonal blockade for heart failure in the setting of left ventricular pump dysfunction, there is still a growing number of patients with advanced symptoms who suffer significant morbidity and mortality. Mechanical stresses and chronic neurohormonal activation conspire to propagate maladaptive ventricular remodeling responsible for the insidious nature of this disease. Recent studies suggest that further pharmacological neurohormonal blockade may not be safe or effective, which has driven development of devices for this patient population. Furthermore, such devices may target fundamental pathophysiological abnormalities that are largely hemodynamic and mechanical in nature that are not addressed by available pharmacological agents. The profound reverse remodeling routinely associated with left ventricular assist device use, reviewed in detail, further validates device-based approaches and should inspire research to find ways to make this recovery more complete and permanent. Accordingly, this review focuses on the multitude of mechanical device-based approaches currently being investigated to manage and treat this population. From devices for monitoring patient status to anticipate congestive heart failure exacerbations and preemptively adjust therapy to devices to support preterminal patients with end-stage disease, it is recognized that these device-based approaches will assume an increasingly important role in treating the growing number of patients with advanced heart failure.
