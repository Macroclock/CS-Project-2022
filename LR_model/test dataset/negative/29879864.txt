Utility of the Psychosocial Assessment of Candidates for Transplantation in Patients Undergoing Continuous-Flow Left Ventricular Assist Device Implantation. Psychosocial assessment of patients comprises an important element in the selection process of appropriate candidates for left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. We sought to determine the association of the well-validated psychosocial assessment of candidates for transplantation (PACT) scale to clinical outcomes post-LVAD implantation. The PACT scale was used retrospectively to reconstruct psychosocial profiles of all patients who underwent a continuous-flow LVAD implantation for all indications at our institution between March 2008 and August 2012 (N = 230). Psychosocial elements including social support, psychological health, lifestyle factors, comprehension of the operation, and follow-up were evaluated. The primary outcome was overall survival, and the secondary outcomes were hospital readmission, pump thrombosis, hemolysis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and LVAD driveline infections. The mean age of patients was 55.3 years, with 83% being male; 58% (N = 135) were bridge to transplant and 42% (N = 95) were destination therapy. Up to 1-year post-LVAD implant, there were no statistical differences among the 5 PACT candidate groups in terms of survival ( P = .79), hospital readmissions ( P = .55), suspected or confirmed pump thrombosis ( P = .31), hemolysis ( P = .43), GI bleeding ( P = .71), or driveline infections ( P = .06). In this single-center retrospective review, post hoc reconstruction of psychosocial profiles using the PACT scale and independent assessment of postimplant outcomes, including survival and adverse events, did not show any association. However, given the small number of patients in the low score PACT groups as well as limited duration of follow-up, further studies are required to elucidate the association.
