Biventricular continuous flow VADs demonstrate diurnal flow variation and lead to end-organ recovery. HeartWare continuous flow ventricular assist devices (HVAD) configured as biventricular assist devices maintain diurnal flow variation, lead to end-organ recovery, and provide for a successful bridge-to-heart transplantation in the first successful North American use of continuous flow biventricular assist devices.
