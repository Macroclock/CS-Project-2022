Low-dose prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin does not prevent HLA sensitization in left ventricular assist device recipients. The use of left ventricular assist devices is associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allosensitization. We investigated whether prophylactic treatment with low-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), analogous to the use of IgG anti-D (anti-Rh) in preventing Rh immunization, can abrogate HLA allosensitization after left ventricular assist device implantation. We retrospectively reviewed the data from 84 consecutive heart failure patients who underwent implantation of a left ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplantation. After implantation, panel reactive antibody (PRA) was measured biweekly to assess sensitization (defined by PRA > 10%). Patients who were sensitized before left ventricular assist device implantation were excluded from further analysis (n = 12). Patients who either did not require perioperatively transfusions of cellular blood products or received other immunomodifying regimens were also excluded from further analysis (n = 21). The rest of the patients were divided into two groups based on whether they received IVIG, 10 g daily for 3 days (IVIG group, n = 26; non-IVIG group, n = 25). The decision as to whether patients received IVIG was not randomized but was based on surgeon preference. The sensitization rates (expressed as ratio of sensitized patients to total patients at risk) in the two groups were similar at consecutive time points (2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 20 weeks) after left ventricular assist device implantation. Also, mean PRA at the same time points did not differ between the two groups. Overall, 34.6% (9 of 26) of the IVIG group became sensitized during mechanical support, compared with 32% (8 of 25) of the non-IVIG group (p = 1.0). A PRA of 90% or greater (high-degree sensitization) occurred in 15.3% (4 of 26) of the IVIG group and 12.0% (3 of 25) of the non-IVIG group (p = 0.5). The use of low-dose prophylactic IVIG after left ventricular assist device implantation affects neither the incidence nor the severity of HLA allosensitization.
