Low Nasal NO in Congenital Heart Disease With Systemic Right Ventricle and Postcardiac Transplantation. NO bioavailability has not been systematically examined in congenital heart disease (CHD). To assess NO in patients with CHD, we measured nasal NO (nNO) generated by the nasal epithelia, given blood NO is difficult to measure (half-life, <2Â ms). Given NO's role in hemodynamic regulation and the association of NO bioavailability with heart failure risk, we hypothesized NO levels may differ with varying severity of CHD physiologic characteristics. Six-hundred eighteen subjects, 483 with CHD and 135 controls, had nNO measured noninvasively via the nares using American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines. Subjects were dichotomized as having low or normal nNO based on age-specific cutoff values. Prevalence of low nNO was examined by various CHD physiologic feature types. Low nNO was more prevalent with CHD than controls (odds ratio, 2.28;  Patients with CHD have increased prevalence of low nNO, with highest odds seen with systemic right ventricle and heart transplant. Further studies are needed to investigate heart failure risks in patients with CHD with left versus right systemic ventricle physiologic characteristics and utility of low nNO for predicting heart failure risk.
