Thyroid nodule and thyroid cancer management pre- and post-cardiac transplantation. Thyroid nodules are common in the adult population. Widespread use of sensitive imaging studies often leads to their incidental discovery. Recent guidelines recommend thyroid-stimulating hormone determination and ultrasonography during initial nodule evaluation. Fine-needle aspiration is often performed to detect malignancy. However, the management of thyroid nodules in cardiac transplantation patients has not been directly addressed by recent guidelines. Confounding medications such as amiodarone and anti-coagulants present a management dilemma. The timing of fine-needle aspiration is crucial because (1) malignancy diagnosed pre-operatively usually precludes organ transplantation, and (2) patients undergoing solid-organ transplantation are at increased risk of developing de novo malignancies, including thyroid. With the rising incidence of thyroid cancer, donor-related malignancy will likely become a more prominent issue. This review addresses thyroid nodule management in the cardiac transplant population and provides recommendations for organ donation and transplantation in donors and recipients with thyroid cancer.
