Aspects of human parasites in which surgical intervention may be important. Until recently, physicians and surgeons in developed countries only occasionally encountered patients with parasitic protozoan and helminthic infections. High-speed travel, immigration and the popularity of the tropics as vacation areas have increased the number of people at risk for parasitic disease. This chapter examines the significant literature on a select number of protozoan and helminthic parasites for which surgical intervention is important in the diagnosis, treatment or cure of the disease. Although traditional surgical approaches are covered, emphasis is placed on recent advances in the areas of transplantation and minimally invasive surgery. Combining the disciplines of parasitology and surgery, this chapter covers three protozoan and seven helminthic parasites for which surgery is a valid treatment option based on the frequency of cases reported in the literature. Following coverage of the selected parasites, a table is included listing additional helminths for which surgery contributes to patient management. Physicians in the USA, UK, and Europe need to be more aware of the presentation and treatment of parasitic infections. It is our sincere hope that this review accomplishes that goal, and ultimately benefits the patients we serve.
