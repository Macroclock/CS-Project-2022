Continuous-Flow Left Ventricular Assist Device Therapy in Adults with Transposition of the Great Vessels. An increasing number of children with congenital heart disease are surviving into adulthood and subsequently developing end-stage heart failure. Two example populations are adults who have been previously operated on for congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA) and transposition of the great arteries (TGA). Implantation of a continuous flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) in these patients can present unusual anatomical and physiologic challenges. In this report, we describe outcomes of CF-LVAD implantation in three such patients. These cases demonstrate the feasibility of implanting a CF-LVAD in patients who have undergone surgery for CCTGA and/or TGA.
