Allograft rejection in a new allospecific CD4+ TCR transgenic mouse. The application of TCR transgenic mice to transplantation immunology is hampered by the limited lines available. Recently, we reported CD4+ T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice specific for I-Abm12 expressed on B6.C.H-2bm12 mice. Here, we characterized rejection of skin and vascularized cardiac allografts in these mice, which we term ABM (for anti-bm12). In vivo proliferative experiments reveal that all CD4 T cells in ABM mice react to bm12 antigens. Surprisingly, while ABM mice have accelerated (compared to B6 recipients) rejection of bm12 skin allografts, they, like B6 recipients, fail to acutely reject bm12 cardiac allografts. This is not due to lack of immunogenicity of bm12 hearts, as these grafts are acutely rejected by primed ABM recipients, although not by primed B6 recipients. Lastly, long-term surviving bm12 grafts in ABM recipients are relatively free from chronic rejection (compared with B6 recipients), which may be due to skewing of the CD4 repertoire towards direct alloreactivity, and consequent lack of CD4 mediated indirect allorecognition as evidenced by the lack of IgG deposition in those grafts. The results indicate that a complex interplay between responder frequency, priming and repertoire dictates the occurrence, or lack thereof, of acute and chronic rejection.
