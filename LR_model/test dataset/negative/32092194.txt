Temporary left ventricular assist devices as a bridge to heart transplantation. To create equitable access to donor organs for the highest mortality patients, the cardiac transplant allocation system now prioritizes patients with surgically implanted temporary left ventricular assist devices (T-LVADs). The outcomes following a direct bridge from a T-LVAD to orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) are not well delineated. This study investigates the T-LVAD waitlist outcomes and compares the posttransplant outcomes in patients bridged to OHT with surgically implanted T-LVADs to patients bridged with durable continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVADs). Adults recorded in the United Network for Organ Sharing registry bridged to OHT with a durable CF-LVAD and T-LVADs, with or without temporary right ventricular assist devices (T-RVADs), between 2010 and 2018 were included. Propensity matching and multivariable Cox regression were utilized to compare outcomes. Of 504 patients waitlisted with T-LVADs, the majority were transplanted (50%), bridged to CF-LVAD (17%), or recovered (9%). A total of 9047 recipients were bridged to OHT during the study period with 8875 CF-LVADs and 172 T-LVADs. Early survival in propensity-matched T-LVAD ± T-RVAD patients was similar to CF-LVAD ± T-RVAD patients but reduced at a 1-year follow-up. This difference in survival at 1-year follow-up was attributable to significantly reduced survival in patients with combined T-LVAD + T-RVAD support when compared with CF-LVAD, isolated T-LVAD and combined CF-LVAD + T-RVAD support (80% vs 90% vs 90% vs 91%; P = .005). This study demonstrates that most patients waitlisted with a T-LVAD are successfully bridged to durable therapy or recover, and those bridged to OHT have acceptable posttransplant outcomes, particularly when T-RVADs are not required.
