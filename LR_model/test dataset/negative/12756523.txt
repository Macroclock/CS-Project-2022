Cardiac allograft vasculopathy: current concepts and treatment. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) remains the leading limiting factor of patient and graft survival after the first post-operative year. The pathogenesis involves both immunological and non-immunological factors. Here, we present recent advances and discuss potential preventative and treatment regimens. A review of the current literature of heart transplantation, detailing molecular mechanisms, pharmacological risk factors and novel immunosuppression regimens was performed. Recent findings demonstrate the pivotal role of the endothelium, resulting in release of pro-fibrotic cytokines, recruitment of circulating leucocytes, proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins (ECMs). The role of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and anti-hypertensives remains controversial, but there is increasing evidence advocating their prophylactic use. We can conclude that novel immunosuppressive agents such as rapamycin, mycophenolate mofetil and FTY-720 are experimental immunosuppressive agents that are undergoing evaluation in clinical trials. The prophylactic use of statins and anti-hypertensive drugs needs to be defined but needs to suggest potential strategies to prolong cardiac allograft survival.
