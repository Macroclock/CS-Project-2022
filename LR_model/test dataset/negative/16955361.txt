Radiofrequency catheter ablation of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia in a patient with orthotopic heart transplantation by bicaval anastomosis. Patients with orthotopic heart transplantation may have a variety of arrhythmias. There are reports of successful radiofrequency catheter ablation of some of them. Two months after orthotopic cardiac transplantation by bicaval anastomosis, a 49-year-old man developed episodes of tachycardia. The patient developed with dyspnoea and hypotension during typical atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) revealed by electrocardiogram. During programmed atrial stimulation with progressively increasing prematurity, dual auriculoventricular nodal physiology was observed and AVNRT was induced. This tachycardia was successfully eliminated without complications by radiofrequency catheter ablation of the slow pathway. The patient remained asymptomatic at 4-month follow-up.
