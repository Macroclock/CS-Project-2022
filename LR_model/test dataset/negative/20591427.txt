[Nocardia infection in heart transplant recipients]. The incidence of Nocardia infection in transplant patients ranges between 0.7 and 3% with a high mortality (26-63%). This fact, together with a median time to diagnosis in about two weeks ago that the state of alertness is of vital clinical importance. From a cohort of 570 cardiac transplant patients, we reviewed the medical records of those who underwent the diagnosis of Nocardia infection during follow-up. We identified four cases (incidence 0.73%), two scattered. In all, had pulmonary involvement. Mortality was high (2 of 4 patients). In cardiac transplant patients Nocardia infection is rare but has a high mortality, being necessary an early diagnosis to establish an appropriate treatment.
