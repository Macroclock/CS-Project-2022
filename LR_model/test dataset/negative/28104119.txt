Association of the Number of HLA-DR Mismatches With Early Post-transplant Acute Cellular Rejection Among Heart Transplantation Recipients: A Cohort Study in Japanese Population. Although many risk factors are reported about graft rejection after heart transplantation (HTx), the effect of HLA mismatch (MM) still remains unknown, especially in the Japanese population. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of HLA MM on graft rejection among HTx recipients in Japan. We retrospectively investigated the association of the number of HLA MM including class I (A, B) and class II (DR) (for each locus MM: 0 to 2, total MM: 0 to 6) and the incidence of moderate to severe acute cellular rejection (ACR) confirmed by endomyocardial biopsy (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade ≥ 3A/2R) within 1 year after HTx. Between 2007 and 2014, we had 49 HTx cases in our institute. After excluding those with insufficient data and positive donor-specific antigen, finally 35 patients were enrolled. Moderate to severe ACR was observed in 16 (45.7%) patients. The number of HLA-DR MM was significantly associated with the development of ACR (ACR+: 1.50 ± 0.63, ACR-: 1.11 ± 0.46, P = .029). From univariate analysis, DR MM = 2 was the only independent risk factor for ACR episodes (P = .017). The frequency of ACR within 1 year was significantly higher in those with DR MM = 2 (DR MM = 0 to 1: 0.3 ± 0.47, DR MM = 2: 1.17 ± 1.34 times, P = .007). The number of HLA-DR MMs was associated with the development and recurrence of ACR episodes among HTx recipients within 1 year after transplantation in Japanese population.
