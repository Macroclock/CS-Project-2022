Frailty of the Heart Recipient. Frailty has been defined as a state of increased vulnerability due to a decline in the reserve and function of multiple physiological systems. Initially conceived as a geriatric syndrome indicative of physiological aging, it is now apparent that frailty can also be observed as a manifestation of chronic disease states including heart failure. Estimates of the prevalence of frailty in heart failure vary according to the age of the study population and the frailty instrument used; however, multiple studies have identified frailty to be prevalent in patients with advanced heart failure including those who are referred for heart transplantation. Frailty is emerging as an independent predictor of mortality both before and after bridge-to-transplant ventricular assist device implantation and heart transplantation. Frailty is also predictive of prolonged hospitalization following these procedures. Heart failure-associated frailty is a dynamic state. While reversibility of frailty can be anticipated in younger heart failure patients, predicting the reversibility of frailty is more challenging in older patients who often have multiple comorbidities that may contribute to the frailty syndrome. Prehabilitation is a promising approach to both preventing and reversing frailty however more research is urgently needed to establish its effectiveness in mitigating the adverse impacts of frailty on postventricular assist device and posttransplant morbidity and mortality.
