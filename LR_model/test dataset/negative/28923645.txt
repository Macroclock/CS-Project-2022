Comparison of Segmental Versus Longitudinal Intravascular Ultrasound Analysis for Pediatric Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has been routinely used in some centers to investigate cardiac allograft vasculopathy in pediatric heart transplant recipients. We present an alternative method using more sophisticated imaging software. This study presents a comparison of this method with an established standard method. All patients who had IVUS performed in 2014 were retrospectively evaluated. The standard technique consisted of analysis of 10 operator-selected segments along the vessel. Each study was re-evaluated using a longitudinal technique, taken at every third cardiac cycle, along the entire vessel. Semiautomatic edge detection software was used to detect vessel imaging planes. Measurements included outer and inner diameter, total and luminal area, maximal intimal thickness (MIT), and intimal index. Each IVUS was graded for severity using the Stanford classification. All results were given as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Groups were compared using Student t test. A P value <.05 was considered significant. There were 59 IVUS studies performed on 58 patients. There was no statistically significant difference between outer diameter, inner diameter, or total area. In the longitudinal group, there was a significantly smaller luminal area, higher MIT, and higher intimal index. Using the longitudinal technique, there was an increase in Stanford classification in 20 patients. The longitudinal technique appeared more sensitive in assessing the degree of cardiac allograft vasculopathy and may play a role in the increase in the degree of thickening seen. It may offer an alternative way of grading severity of cardiac allograft vasculopathy in pediatric heart transplant recipients.
