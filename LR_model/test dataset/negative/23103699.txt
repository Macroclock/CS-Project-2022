Pump exchange for cable damage in patients supported with HeartMate II left ventricular assist device. Implantable continuous flow pumps are a routine treatment for end-stage heart failure. The waiting time for heart transplantation is increasing, and more and more patients receive the pump for permanent support. We retrospectively analyzed our database of patients supported with the HeartMate II left ventricular assist device to identify instances of cable damage. Between May 9, 2006 and May 9, 2012, 161 patients were supported with the HeartMate II. There were 187 cumulative years of HeartMate II support. The documented cable damage occurred in 12 patients (7.5%), requiring pump exchange in five patients after a mean time of 706 days on support. There was no perioperative mortality. The damage occurred typically at the "weak" place-the feedthrough of the driveline to the pump body. In some cases, the device alarm history and x-ray may allow diagnosis before pump stop occurs. However, since the most recent changes in the design of the connection and modifications made in the implantation technique, no instance of cable damage has been registered.
