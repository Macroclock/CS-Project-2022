Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome combined with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after heart transplantation. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) combined with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a rare complication in patients treated with immunosuppressants. A 52-year-old male patient presented with seizures after heart transplantation. The patient was suspected of having PRES on brain images. Despite the strict blood pressure control, the patient presented with altered mentality and the brain images showed a newly developed large acute infarction. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed the classic "sausage on a string" appearance of the cerebral arteries - potential feature of RCVS. To our knowledge, this is the first case report to describe RCVS combined with PRES after heart transplantation.
