Kaposi's sarcoma associated with previous human herpesvirus 8 infection in heart transplant recipients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) in a group of 150 patients awaiting heart transplants and to detect HHV-8 seroconversion after transplantation. Four patients were HHV-8 seropositive before transplantation, and one of them developed Kaposi's sarcoma. One patient converted to seropositive HHV-8 status after transplantation.
