Heart transplantation as rescue treatment of left main stem occlusion by a recurrent aortic pseudoaneurysm. A 58 year-old man was admitted in our ICU for cardiogenic shock and electrical storm. His medical history was marked by a triple redo valvular surgery complicated by a recurrent aortic pseudoaneurysm of the ascending aorta. Coronary angiogram and heart CT scan diagnosed an extensive anterior myocardial infarction related to an extrinsic compression of the left main stem by this massive and calcified pseudoaneurysm. Angioplasty or new cardiac surgery options were rejected by the heart team. Despite an unusual indication, the patient was registered on the heart transplant list, and underwent it successfully.
