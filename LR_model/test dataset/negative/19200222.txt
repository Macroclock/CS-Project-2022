Role of dietary intervention and nutritional follow-up in heart transplant recipients. Obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus are common features after heart transplantation and they lead to coronary artery disease and graft loss. To determine the effects of a dietary intervention on nutritional status and metabolic outcome of two groups enrolled during or after the first year from the transplant. Forty two subjects (mean age 51.36+/-12.4 yr) were studied; 20 were enrolled during the first year by the transplant, 22 were enrolled after the first year from the transplant (7.9+/-3.86 and 56.86+/-38.6 months after surgery, respectively). According to diet compliance both groups were divided into two subgroups and they were prospectively followed for 4 years. Anthropometric measurements, biochemical nutritional markers, and dietary records were collected at baseline (T0) and after a 12-month follow-up period (T12) and a 48-month follow-up period (T48). Body composition was performed at T0 and T12. Diet compliance was associated with a decrease in total cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose plasma level and with a weight loss mainly due to a decrease in fat mass. Our study shows the efficacy of dietary intervention to obtain an early and late weight and metabolic control after heart transplant.
