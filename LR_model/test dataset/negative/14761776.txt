Dobutamine-related asthma in a patient awaiting cardiac transplantation: the eosinophilic dilemma. Long-term continuous intravenous inotrope infusion is frequently used as a pharmacologic bridge to cardiac transplantation in patients with end-stage congestive heart failure. We report a case of severe eosinophil-associated asthma after 6 weeks of therapy with the inotrope dobutamine in a patient awaiting cardiac transplantation. Review of the laboratory data revealed a steady increase in eosinophils during the period of treatment with dobutamine. Once the patient was switched to an alternative inotrope, milrinone, the eosinophil count returned to normal, and the asthma exacerbation resolved.
