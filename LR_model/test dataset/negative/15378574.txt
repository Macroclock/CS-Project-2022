Technique for retransplanting heterotopic heart grafts in mice. Removal of a transplanted organ from its original recipient and retransplanting it into a new host is an important method to study the role of the graft in the rejection process. Here we describe a novel technique of heart retransplantation in the mouse. In this technique, a primarily vascularized heart graft is anastomosed to the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava of a syngeneic or immunodeficient allogeneic mouse, using standard techniques. Either 10 or 70 days later, the same graft is retransplanted into the abdomen of a second mouse by end-to-side anastomosis of the donor (first recipient) aortic and inferior vena cava's cuffs to the second recipient's abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava, respectively. A greater than 90% success rate was achieved by using this microsurgical technique. This method should be useful for studying intragraft factors, such as ischemia-reperfusion injury and donor antigen-presenting cells, on the outcomes of transplantations.
