Percutaneous transcatheter balloon valvuloplasty for bioprosthetic tricuspid valve stenosis in a patient with orthotopic heart transplant. A 47-year-old man with history of familial cardiomyopathy and orthotopic heart transplant at the age of 34 years presented severe tricuspid stenosis (TS) with a mean transvalvular gradient of 10 mm Hg. The patient opted against tricuspid valve replacement and was offered percutaneous transcatheter tricuspid balloon valvuloplasty (PTTBV). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a PTTBV in an orthotopic allograft, and demonstrates excellent clinical outcome at 1 year.
