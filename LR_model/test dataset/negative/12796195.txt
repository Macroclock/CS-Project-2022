Cardiac rehabilitation following percutaneous revascularization, heart transplant, heart valve surgery, and for chronic heart failure. This review discusses the scientific and clinical evidence for cardiac rehabilitation in patients who have undergone percutaneous revascularization, heart transplant, and heart valve surgery, and in patients with chronic heart failure. Across these diagnoses, regardless of age, there is considerable benefit of cardiac rehabilitation and supervised exercise training for increasing functional capacity, favorably modifying disease-related risk factors, decreasing symptoms, detecting signs and symptoms of disease before they become serious complications, and improving quality of life. The available evidence for this component of cardiovascular disease management, albeit not perfect, still warrants its more widespread application.
