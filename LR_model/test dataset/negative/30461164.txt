Edwards Sapien 3 transcatheter aortic valve implantation for management of severe aortic regurgitation in a teenage patient with corrected atrioventricular septal defect and progressive left ventricular dysfunction. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is mostly performed in elderly patients with severely calcified aortic valves. There are few reports about its use for pure aortic regurgitation, few reports about its use in adolescent patients and to the best of our knowledge no report about the use of an Edwards Sapien valve in the aortic position in an underage patient after surgically corrected congenital heart disease (CHD). Decompensation of a complex CHD can be difficult to manage and may require unusual solutions. We report a case of a teenage patient presenting with progressive aortic regurgitation and deterioration of left ventricular function after multiple surgical procedures for an atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD). As "bridge-to-transplant," we performed a transcatheter aortic valve implantation using a balloon-expandable Sapien 3 prosthesis. At 6 month follow-up, the patient remained clinically stable with no rehospitalization due to heart failure. 'TAVI', 'aortic regurgitation', 'congenital heart disease', 'heart insufficiency'
