Early detection of left ventricular dysfunction related to transplant coronary artery disease. Transplant coronary artery disease (TxCAD) is a major limitation to the long-term success of cardiac transplantation. We assessed left ventricular (LV) function in relation to severity of coronary lesions to improve both early diagnosis of TxCAD and evaluation of the severity of myocardial damage. Echocardiographic evaluation of LV function, including pulsed-wave tissue Doppler imaging (PW-TDI) wall motion analysis, was performed in 304 heart recipients before each of their follow-up cardiac catheterizations. LV systolic and diastolic parameters obtained both invasively and non-invasively were tested for their relation to angiographic and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) findings. LV end-diastolic pressure and most of the PW-TDI parameters differed significantly (p < 0.001) between patients with and without TxCAD. In comparison to patients without the disease, even those with moderate, angiographically non-visible TxCAD showed significant differences for all systolic PW-TDI parameters. Wall motion alterations during angiographic TxCAD were almost always global and related mainly to diffuse Type B lesions. Systolic PW-TDI parameter changes showed highly predictive values for TxCAD. At systolic wall motion peak velocity (Sm) values constantly <10 cm/sec, we found a 97.37% likelihood of TxCAD (angiographically and/or IVUS-visible), whereas Sm values of > or =11 cm/sec excluded angiographic TxCAD with 90.41% probability. Among all parameters investigated for the evaluation of allograft LV function, PW-TDI systolic parameters were of the greatest diagnostic value. Wall motion assessment allows early detection of myocardial dysfunction and provides information on both local and global LV dysfunction linked to TxCAD, with potential usefulness for both timing of cardiac catheterizations and prognostic evaluation.
