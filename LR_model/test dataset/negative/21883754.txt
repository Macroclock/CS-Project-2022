Colocolonic intussusception in a four-yr-old with a heart transplant: a case report and review of the literature. A rare case of a colocolonic intussusception in a pediatric cardiac transplant patient is reported along with a review of colocolonic intussusception in pediatric patients after organ transplantation. A four-yr-old girl with a history of heart transplantation shortly after birth presented with a 12-hour history of abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody stools. Initial abdominal x-ray showed rectal edema. A rectal examination revealed a palpable intussusceptum that prompted a therapeutic contrast enema, which failed to reduce the intussusception. Surgical exploration was performed with reduction of the intussusception and resection of the terminal ileum and cecum. A pathologic lead point was not identified.
