Early assessment of right ventricular systolic function after pediatric heart transplant. RV systolic function is important early after HT; however, it has not been critically assessed in children using quantitative measures. The aim of this study was to describe the most validated and commonly used quantitative echocardiographic measures of RV systolic function early after pediatric HT and to assess associations with qualitative function evaluation and clinical factors. RV systolic function was quantified on the first post-HT echocardiogram >24 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass using two-dimensional TAPSE, Tricuspid annular S', FAC, and MPI. In 145 patients (median age 7.6 years), quantitative RV systolic function was markedly abnormal: mean TAPSE z-score -8.43 ± 1.89; S' z-score -4.36 ± 1.22; FAC 24.4 ± 8.34%; and MPI 0.86 ± 0.51. Few patients had normal quantitative function: TAPSE (0%), S' (1.2%), FAC (9.4%), and MPI (28.4%). In contrast, 48.3% were observed as normal by qualitative assessment. Most clinical factors, including diagnosis, pulmonary vascular resistance, posttransplant hemodynamics, inotropic support, and rejection, were not associated with RV function. In this large pediatric HT population, TAPSE, S', FAC, and MPI were strikingly abnormal early post-HT despite reassuring qualitative assessment and no significant association with clinical factors. This suggests that the accepted normal values of these quantitative measures may not apply in the early post-HT period to accurately grade RV systolic function, and there may be utility in adapting a concept of normal reference values after pediatric HT.
