Human Leukocyte Antigen Antibody Sampling in Ventricular Assist Device Recipients: Are We Talking? Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are commonly used as a bridge to transplantation but may yield HLA sensitization. We evaluated the prevalence of HLA antibody (Ab) sampling pre- and post-VAD placement in pediatric and adult patients and notification of VAD status to the HLA laboratory. All pediatric and adult patients who received a first-time VAD between 2005 and 2013 were included in this single-center retrospective review. Data were collected from the University of Alberta Hospital histocompatibility laboratory's information system and a local VAD database. In total, 106 patients were included (40 pediatric, median 3.0 years [interquartile range, 0.3-10.7]; 66 adult, 55.0 years [46.8-61.2]). HLA Ab sampling within 1-month pre-VAD occurred in 70% of pediatric and 79% of adult recipients (P = .215). Testing within 1 month of VAD placement occurred in 89% of pediatric and 67% of adult recipients (P = .012). For those with HLA Ab sampling within 30 days postimplant, notification to the HLA laboratory of VAD status occurred in 19 of 27 (70%) pediatric and 24 of 33 (73%) adult patients (P = .533). Of patients transplanted post VAD with HLA Ab samples collected, 12 of 28 (43%) and 13 of 38 (34%) adult recipients did not have notification of VAD status to the HLA laboratory (P = .322). There were inconsistencies in HLA Ab sampling and communication to the HLA laboratory surrounding VAD placement. Standardization of both HLA Ab assessment frequency after VAD implantation and communication regarding changes in clinical status and the occurrence of key sensitizing events such as VAD placement are imperative as patients await transplantation.
