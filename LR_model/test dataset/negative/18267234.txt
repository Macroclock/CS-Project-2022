Giant cell myocarditis mimicking idiopathic fascicular ventricular tachycardia. We report an adolescent with giant cell myocarditis (GCM) mimicking tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His electrocardiogram (ECG) was typical for an incessant form of fascicular ventricular tachycardia. The patient rapidly deteriorated and required support using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Biopsy revealed GCM with massive myocyte necrosis. He was successfully heart transplanted 6 days after admission.
