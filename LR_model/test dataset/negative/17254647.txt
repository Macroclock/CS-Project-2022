Early changes in bioprosthetic heart valves following ventricular assist device implantation. Heart valve bioprostheses can undergo early post-implantation changes, including pannus and thrombus, which may be hastened by the presence of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). We report the case of a 21 year-old male who was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and severe aortic insufficiency, and had his aortic valve replaced with a #25 BioPhysio valve (currently in clinical trials--Edwards Life Sciences, Irvine, CA, USA). His symptoms of congestive heart failure continued to worsen, and he received a Novacor LVAD (WorldHeart, Oakland, CA, USA), and subsequently, an orthotopic heart transplantation. The relevant pathologies of the heart, BioPhysio valve (in place for 4.5 months), and Novacor device are presented.
