Use of quality index in the evaluation of organ procurement and transplant programs in a University Hospital. To evaluate organ procurement efficiency at Hospital Clinic of Barcelona (HCP), a University Hospital, in 2000 and 2003 compared with other Catalan, other Spanish, and American (US) results. Efficacy rate of the donor procurement was calculated per million population per year (pmp/y). Efficacy rate in kidney, liver, and heart transplantation was calculated also in pmp/y. We evaluated 1-year graft survival. During this period, the average rate number of donors was 49.1 pmp/y in HCP, 38 in Catalonia, 33.4 in Spain, and 21.7 in the United States. The average rate of kidney transplantation was 74 pmp/y in HCP, 55 in Catalonia, 47 in Spain, and 24.6 in the United States. The average rate of liver transplantation was 44.5, 26.6, 23.2, and 18 pmp/y, respectively. The average rate of heart transplantation was 13.3, 8.5, 7.8, and 6.4 pmp/y, respectively. One-year graft survival in HCP was 90.6% for kidney, 89.5% for liver, and 88.2% for heart transplants. The results show that organ procurement and transplantation programs in HCP are efficient. The organizational model is based on a hospital transplant coordinator and efficient, well-trained transplant teams.
