Prognostic Value of Creatinine Concentration and Glomerular Filtration Rate in Acute Kidney Injury Development in the Early Postoperative Period After Heart Transplantation. Recipients of nonrenal organ transplants, including the heart, are at risk for developing acute kidney injury (AKI). This situation significantly jeopardized the outcome of patients. The most effective treatment is continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) AIM: The goal of this project is to verify the prognostic value of preoperative serum creatinine concentration and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula, to determine the risk of renal failure after grafting RESULTS: In the group of 39 patients, CRRT was needed in 7 patients (17.9%; group K); 32 patients were in the control group (group C). The pretransplant creatinine level in group K was 133.7 ± 31.3 μmol/L and in group C was 160.8 ± 97.6 μmol/L; P = .47. We did not find a difference between groups in GFR: group K 51 ± 6mL/min/1.73 m Developing AKI requiring CRRT after heart transplantation prolonged the length of ICU stays. Preoperative creatinine concentration and glomerular filtration rate do not predict AKI.
