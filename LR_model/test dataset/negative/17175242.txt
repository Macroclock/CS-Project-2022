Cytoprotective gene HO-1 and chronic rejection in heart transplantation. Chronic rejection in transplanted hearts or cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the leading cause of late death among heart transplant recipients. We hypothesized that induction of HO-1 by D4-F, an apoA-I mimetic peptide with potent antiinflammatory/antioxidant properties, attenuated CAV. We utilized a previously characterized murine model of CAV. B6.C-H2(bml2) hearts were heterotopically transplanted into C57BL/6 mice. In the control group, recipient mice were treated with 20 microg of saline daily. In experimental group I, mice were treated daily with 20 microg of D4-F. In experimental group II, mice were treated daily with 20 microg of D4-F daily, plus CuPP, which does not have any effect on HO-1 activity. In experimental group III, recipient mice were treated with 20 mug of D4-F daily, plus SnPP, which is a competitive inhibitor of HO-1. Donor hearts were harvested on day 24 after transplantation. The donor hearts in the control group developed severe intimal lesions. In experimental group I, treatment with D4-F was associated with upregulation of HO-1 and a marked reduction in intimal lesions, which was consistent in experimental group II. In experimental group III, inhibition of HO-1 was associated with partial restoration of intimal lesions. Induction of HO-1 by an apoA-1 mimetic peptide was effective to control CAV. This class of antiinflammatory peptides, which show an ability to induce HO-1, provides a novel strategy for the treatment of CAV.
