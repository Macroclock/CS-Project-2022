Levitronix CentriMag third-generation magnetically levitated continuous flow pump as bridge to solution. The Levitronix CentriMag (Levitronix LLC, Waltham, MA) ventricular assist device (VAD) is a magnetically levitated rotary pump designed for temporary extracorporeal support. Between February 2004 and May 2010, 42 consecutive adult patients were supported with Levitronix at our institution (32 men; age 62.3 ± 10.5 years, range: 31-76 years). Indications for support were (group A, n = 37) failure to wean from the cardiopulmonary bypass in the setting of postcardiotomy (n = 23), primary donor graft failure (n = 4), or right ventricular failure after axial left VAD (LVAD) placement (n = 10) and (group B, n = 5) refractory heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. The mean support time was 11.2 ± 6.8 days (range: 3-43 days) in group A and 8.6 ± 4.3 days (range: 5-11 days) in group B. In the postcardiotomy cohort (group A), 11 (47.8%) patients were weaned from support as all were supported graft failure patients. Eight patients of axial LVAD cohort were weaned from right VAD (RVAD). One patient was bridged to heart transplantation (Htx). Thirteen (35.1%) patients died on support in group A. In group B, one patient was bridged to Htx and four died on support. In overall population, bleeding requiring reoperation occurred in 15 (35.7%) cases and cerebral major events in four (9.5%). There were no device failures. Of the 23 (54.7%) patients who recovered and were discharged home, 20 (47.6%) are presently alive, and additionally, two patients of both groups who were bridged to Htx (overall n = 22, 52.3%). The Levitronix proved to be useful in patients previously considered nonsuitable for transplantation or long-term assist device. The device was technically easy to manage, and the results were encouraging.
