Renal protective strategies in heart transplant patients. Chronic renal failure associated with long-term calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppression is a substantial clinical problem in the heart transplant population, compounded by difficulties in identifying patients likely to develop renal dysfunction. Several approaches, however, have been developed or are being investigated to preserve renal function in heart transplant patients. Approaches to identify patients with an increased risk of developing renal dysfunction are being refined, and improved calcineurin inhibitor monitoring strategies are being investigated. Novel immunosuppressive regimens including mycophenolate mofetil and/or rapamycin that lack nephrotoxicity promise new therapeutic strategies with the efficacy of calcineurin inhibitor-based combinations. Temporary ('holiday') or permanent ('retirement') calcineurin inhibitor replacement with interleukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibodies has the potential to halt progressive renal dysfunction. Finally, emerging data on the renal protection afforded by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, either singly or in combination, provide another avenue of investigation. Several strategies have demonstrated their potential to preserve or improve renal function in heart transplant patients in small studies. Large randomized controlled trials are necessary to determine the optimal strategies to prevent rejection while preserving renal function in the long-term management of heart transplant patients.
