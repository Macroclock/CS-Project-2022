Young Patient with Advanced Heart Failure No Longer a Candidate for Heart Transplantation after MitraClipÂ® Procedure. In Europe, mitral regurgitation (MR) is the second most common form of valvular heart disease requiring surgical treatment. The case is presented of a 36-year-old woman with end-stage heart failure secondary to chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity, complicated by severe MR. She was listed for heart transplantation and underwent percutaneous MitraClip® implantation in order to preclude further clinical deterioration while awaiting a suitable donor. The one-year follow-up showed a strong improvement of symptoms and mostly reverse left ventricular remodelling, with consequent removal from the heart transplantation list.
