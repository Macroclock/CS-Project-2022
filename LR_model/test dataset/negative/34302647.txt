Fabrication of Cardiac Constructs Using Bio-3D Printer. The fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) cardiac tissue using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) is useful not only for regenerative medicine, but also for drug discovery. Here, we report a bio-3D printer that can fabricate tubular cardiac constructs using only human iPSC-CMs. Protocols to evaluate the contractile force and response to electrical stimulation in the cardiac constructs are described. We confirmed that the constructs can be applied for transplantation or drug response testing. In the near future, we expect that the constructs will be used as alternatives for heart transplantation and in animal experiments for new drug development.
