Five-year follow-up of hepatitis C-naïve heart transplant recipients who received hepatitis C-positive donor hearts. Due to the risk of transmission of hepatitis C virus, the use of hepatitis C seropositive donors in heart transplantation is controversial. The transmission rate of hepatitis C in this patient population is estimated to range from 67% to 80%. Long-term clinical outcomes of heart transplant recipients of hepatitis C-positive donor hearts are not well described. We report the 5-year long-term outcome of seven hepatitis C-naïve heart transplant recipients who received hepatitis C-positive donor hearts. Retrospective analysis of clinical course, liver biochemistry, serology, and hepatitis C virology data. Seven hearts transplant recipients, six men and one woman were included in our study. After a mean follow-up of 63.3 +/- 20.4 months (range 28.2 to 85.9), four of seven (57.1%) patients are hepatitis C-negative, have normal liver function tests, and no clinical evidence of hepatitis. Three of seven (43%) have been diagnosed with hepatitis C by liver biopsy or the HCV-RNA reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction at a mean follow-up of 35.1 months (18.8 months posttransplantation). One had an accelerated course of hepatitis that was ultimately fatal, one was successfully treated with interferon, and the third died from other causes than liver injury. Overall, the 5-year survival was 71.4%. The 5-year survival of hepatitis C-naïve recipients of hearts from hepatitis C-positive donors is similar to heart transplant recipients with hepatitis-negative donor hearts. Nevertheless, the transmission rate is high and hepatitis C infection in this population can lead to considerable morbidity and accelerated, fatal hepatitis.
