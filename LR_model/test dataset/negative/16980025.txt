Bone mineral density in long-term Chinese heart transplant recipients: a cross-sectional study. Osteoporosis, which usually peaks during 6 to 12 months after transplantation, remains an important concern after heart transplantation. Immunosuppressants contribute to this phenomenon. Glucocorticoids are well documented to cause bone loss, but the role of cyclosporine (CsA) remains controversial, especially among long-term recipients on low doses of steroid. We herein report a cross-sectional study of bone mineral density (BMD) among long-term Chinese heart transplant recipients. We enrolled 41 patients of mean age 50.15 +/- 13.58 years with a mean follow-up of 57.02 months. Lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD were measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Trough CsA levels (C(0)) and markers of mineral metabolism, including bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and urinary N-telopeptide, were determined by immunoassay. Sixty six percent of subjects showed bone loss at the femoral neck, significantly more than those in the lumbar spine. Those receiving a higher CsA dosage (<2.5 mg/kg/d) showed greater femoral neck BMD, but lower serum creatinine values. Our results demonstrated that bone loss remains long after transplantation, though bone markers are within normal limits.
