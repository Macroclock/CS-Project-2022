Pulsatile ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplant for the early high-risk single-ventricle physiology. The use of ventricular assist devices (VADs) as a bridge-to-transplant in patients with single-ventricle physiology post-stage one palliation has been associated with poor outcomes. We describe our center's successful experience in the use of paracorporeal pulsatile VADs in the palliation of high-risk single ventricle physiology before or after the first stage of palliation with an impetus on pre-palliation implant. This is a single-center retrospective review of univentricular patients implanted with the Berlin Heart EXCOR VAD. Our center's approach includes early implantation of the Berlin Heart EXCOR with common atrial cannulation, a cardiac index between 3.5 and 5 L/min/m Nine patients were supported. Survival to discharge post-transplant was 83% (5/6) in patients bridged-to-transplant and 33% (1/3) in patients bridged-to-decision. Six patients had no previous palliation. Median hospital stay before implantation was 111 days for nonsurvivors versus 20 days for survivors. The need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation in nonsurvivors versus survivors was 1 in 3 versus 1 in 6 and 2 in 3 versus 1 in 6, respectively. There were no major central nervous system complications except for 1 significant hemorrhagic event. The pediatric overall performance category score on follow-up was normal to mild disability in 83% of survivors. Limitations include hemolysis and intermittent periods of infection and/or inflammation. The use of pulsatile paracorporeal VADs is a feasible option as a bridge-to-transplant in the peri-stage one high-risk single ventricle.
