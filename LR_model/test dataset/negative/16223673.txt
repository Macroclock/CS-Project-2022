Baohuoside-1 inhibits activated T cell proliferation at G(1)-S phase transition. The effect of baohuoside-1 (B1), a novel flavonoid, on cell proliferation and the cell cycle was evaluated in this study. The antiproliferative properties of B1 were evaluated by proliferation assay. Western blotting and flow cytometric analysis were employed to investigate the expression of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase proteins. The major findings were (1) B1 effectively inhibited the cell proliferation activated by mitogenic antigen, with a 50% inhibitory concentration in low muM and in a dose- and time-dependent manner. (2) B1 resulted in G(1)-S phase cells arrest. (3) It down-regulated the expression of cyclin A, D and p33 cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (p33cdk2) proteins. (4) B1 suppressed the growth of several tumor cell lines. (5) B1 prevented rat heart allograft rejection in vivo. B1 immunosuppression of mitogen-activated T cell proliferation occurs in G(1)-S transition. It may be associated with the expression of cyclin A, D and p33cdk2 proteins. B1 prevents rat heart allograft rejection in vivo. The mechanism of B1 is different from tacrolimus and sirolimus.
