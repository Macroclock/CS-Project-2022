Ventricular Arterial Coupling: A Novel Echocardiographic Risk Factor for Disease Progression in Pediatric Dilated Cardiomyopathy. In adult heart failure (HF) patients, a higher ventricular arterial (VA) coupling ratio measured non-invasively is associated with worse HF prognosis and response to treatment. There are no data regarding the relationship of VA coupling to outcome in pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients. We investigated the association of VA coupling ratio with worse outcome (mechanical circulatory support, transplant, or death) in 48 children with DCM and 97 age-gender matched controls. Mean age at presentation was 9 ± 7 years; DCM patients had a higher arterial elastance (3.8 ± 1.7 vs 2.7 ± 0.7 respectively p = 0.001), a lower LV elastance (1.1 ± 0.65 vs 4.5 ± 1.4, respectively p = 0.001) and higher VA coupling ratio (5.0 ± 3.9 vs 0.34 ± 0.14, respectively p = 0.001). Outcome events occurred in 27/48 (56%) patients. Patients with an outcome event had a higher NYHA class (p = 0.001), lower LV elastance (0.8 ± 0.47 vs 1.6 ± 0.57, respectively p = 0.001), higher arterial elastance (4.5 ± 1.8 vs 2.9 ± 1.1, respectively p = 0.002), and a higher VA coupling ratio (7.1 ± 3.8 vs 2.2 ± 1.5, respectively p = 0.001) compared to those without. In a multivariate CART analysis, VA coupling was the top and only discriminator of poor outcome. In conclusion, a higher VA coupling ratio is associated with worse outcome in pediatric patients with DCM. VA coupling is promising as a bedside analysis tool that may provide insight into the mechanisms of HF in pediatric DCM and identify potential targets for therapy.
