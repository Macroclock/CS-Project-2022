Endomyocardial Fibrosis With End-Stage Heart Failure as a Consequence of a Myeloproliferative Neoplasm With Hypereosinophilia. Hypereosinophilic syndrome is characterized by an overproduction of eosinophils that infiltrate and damage multiple organs. Cardiac dysfunction occurs frequently and is a main cause of morbidity and mortality. We describe the case of a middle-aged man diagnosed with a myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with hypereosinophilia and treated with imatinib. He was diagnosed with cardiac involvement by hypereosinophilic syndrome at a late stage, with an established restrictive cardiomyopathy. Because of end-stage heart failure, he successfully received a heart transplant. This disease might not be considered a contraindication for heart transplantation.
