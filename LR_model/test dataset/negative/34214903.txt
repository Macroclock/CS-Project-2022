The lncRNA PVT1 regulates autophagy in regulatory T cells to suppress heart transplant rejection in mice by targeting miR-146a. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are indispensable for the maintenance of immune tolerance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the interaction of the lncRNA PVT1 and miR-146a on Treg autophagy and reveal the mechanism to alleviate transplant rejection. PVT1 and miR-146a expression levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Bioinformatic analysis and methylation profiling were used to determine the relationship between PVT1 and miR-146a. Altered autophagic status in Tregs was detected by western blotting. The effect of autophagy on Treg function was assessed in cell coculture in vitro and in animal models. Our results showed that PVT1 expression was reduced in Tregs during rejection and negatively correlated with miR-146a expression. Higher PVT1 expression was associated with higher autophagy in Tregs. Further, highly autophagic Tregs had stronger inhibitory effects on CD4 'Autophagy', 'Long noncoding RNA', 'MicroRNA', 'Mouse heart transplant', 'Regulatory T cell', 'Rejection'
