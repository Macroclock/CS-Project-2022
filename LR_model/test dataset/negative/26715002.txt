Two Cases of Late Shone Syndrome With Pulmonary Hypertension: Heart-Lung Transplant or Valve Surgery? Two cases of Shone syndrome with severe mitral and aortic valve problems and pulmonary hypertension were referred for heart-lung transplantation. Severely elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was confirmed as was severe periprosthetic mitral and aortic regurgitation. Based on the severity of the valve lesions in both patients, surgery was decided upon and undertaken. Both experienced early pulmonary hypertensive crises, one more than the other, that gradually subsided, followed by excellent recovery and reversal of pulmonary hypertension and PVR. These cases illustrate Braunwald's concept that pulmonary hypertension secondary to left-sided valve disease is reversible.
