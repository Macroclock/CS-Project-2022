Impact of coronary endothelial function on the progression of cardiac transplant-associated arteriosclerosis: effect of anti-oxidant vitamins C and E. Excessive vascular oxidant stress has been implicated in cardiac transplant-associated arteriosclerosis (TxAA). In a recent placebo-controlled study of 40 cardiac transplant recipients, vitamin C 500 mg twice a day and vitamin E 400 IU twice a day for 1 year retarded the progression of TxAA, as assessed by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Endothelial dysfunction is a key feature of TxAA and reflects oxidant stress. We hypothesized that coronary endothelial dysfunction portends greater TxAA progression and a larger therapeutic response to anti-oxidant vitamins. In this pre-specified analysis, the 40 cardiac transplant recipients were categorized according to normal or abnormal coronary endothelial vasomotor function at baseline, as assessed by acetylcholine (10(-8) to 10(-6) mol/liter). The effect of anti-oxidant vitamins within these two groups of patients was assessed by the change in intimal index over 1 year using IVUS. With placebo (n = 21), the increase in intimal index was greater in the presence vs absence of endothelial dysfunction (11 +/- 3% vs 5 +/- 1%, p < 0.05). Among patients with endothelial dysfunction (n = 21), the intimal index increased 11 +/- 3% with placebo, but decreased -1 +/- 2% with vitamins (p = 0.002). Among patients with normal endothelial function (n = 14), the intimal index increased 5 +/- 1% with placebo and 1 +/- 1% with vitamins (p < 0.05). Endothelial dysfunction indicates rapid TxAA progression, even in the statin era. Although anti-oxidant vitamins reduce disease progression in patients with normal or abnormal endothelial function, the magnitude of benefit is larger in patients with endothelial dysfunction.
