Rehospitalization Following Pediatric Heart Transplantation: Incidence, Indications, and Risk Factors. Rehospitalization following pediatric heart transplantation is common. However, existing data remain somewhat limited. Using a novel linkage between administrative and clinical databases, pediatric heart transplant (HT) recipients from 29 centers who survived to discharge were retrospectively reviewed to determine the frequency, timing of, and indication for all-cause rehospitalizations in the year following transplant discharge. Of 2870 pediatric HT recipients, 1835 (63.9%) were rehospitalized in the first year post-discharge (5429 total readmissions). Rehospitalization rates varied significantly across centers (46% to 100%) and were inversely correlated to center transplant volume (r 'Hospital readmission', 'Pediatric heart transplant', 'Rehospitalization'
