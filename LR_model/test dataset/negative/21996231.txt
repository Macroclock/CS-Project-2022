Influence of "urgent" versus "planned" heart transplantation on healthy behaviors among patients. The aim of this study was to compare health behaviors among patients after heart transplantation, depending on the mode of qualification for the surgery. A questionnaire was completed by 115 patients who underwent heart transplantation surgery. The first part covered sociodemographic data before and after transplantation; the second part the medical data, and the last part behaviors before and after transplantation, such as smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol, and systematic compliance to medications. Behaviors associated with health were evaluated with the of a health behavior inventory including 24 statements referring to behaviors associated with health. Fifty-two patients (45.21%) including 13 women and 39 men underwent a heart transplantation performed in the "urgent" mode. They were significantly younger than those with a "planned" transplantation: 50.65±16.19 vs 57.22±10.26 (P<.05). No significant differences were observed in smoking tobacco or drinking alcohol after the transplantation. However, patients transplanted in the "urgent" mode more frequently were compliant to the medication regimen than those in the "planned" mode. These results showed a significant influence of the transplantation mode both on the eating habits and every day health practices after transplantation (P<.05). People awaiting transplantation at home showed a stronger conviction about the influence of coincidental (chance) factors on their health, in opposition to their own behavior or the actions of the medical staff (P<.05). Patients transplanted in the urgent mode showed a higher level of health practices after transplantation, more frequent attention to their health condition as dependent on their own behavior or the medical crew's actions, and a higher level of health practices compared with other cardiac patients.
