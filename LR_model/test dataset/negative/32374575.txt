Cardiac donation after circulatory death. Increasing number of patients with end-stage heart failure and those with improved survivorship from selective utilization of implantable mechanical circulatory support devices have added further burden and complexity to the transplant waitlist and on the rate-limiting availability of donor hearts from the standard pathway of donation after brain death. Unlike this conventional route, the increasing clinical use of donation after circulatory death (DCD) donor hearts necessitates a closer understanding of the logistics involved in the DCD process as well as of the risks associated with the unique pathophysiological consequences in this setting. Notwithstanding a higher incidence of delayed graft function, the clinical utilization of DCD hearts for cardiac transplantation over the past five years has demonstrated this to be a well-tolerated and strategic alternative with excellent medium-term clinical outcomes. The uptake of DCD heart transplantation remains selective and currently confined to Australia, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and more recently the USA. A more significant adoption will only come about through: a concerted effort to resolve the ethical and clinical controversies; a better understanding of postconditioning strategies; continued resolve to reduce the obligatory period of warm ischemia; and from better extracorporeal platforms that permit functional viability assessment of the DCD donor heart.
