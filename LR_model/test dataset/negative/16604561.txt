Amiodarone lung toxicity in a cardiac transplant candidate initially diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration: cytologic, histologic, and electronmicroscopic findings. A cardiac transplant candidate with ischemic cardiomyopathy developed bilateral small parenchymal opacities in lower lobes of the lung. A fine-needle aspiration (FNA) was performed that revealed changes characteristic of amiodarone toxicity. Subsequently performed lung biopsies and electron microscopic studies confirmed the initial FNA diagnosis. The patient has been successfully transplanted with marked improvement in his clinical findings. This is the first case of amiodarone lung toxicity where the diagnosis was initially suggested based on the FNA findings. We also describe the clinical, cytological, histological, and electron microscopic (EM) findings of amiodarone-related pulmonary toxicity and provide a review of the literature.
