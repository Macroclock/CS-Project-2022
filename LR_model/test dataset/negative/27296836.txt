Knockout of microRNA-155 ameliorates the Th1/Th17 immune response and tissue injury in chronic rejection. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are integral for maintaining immune homeostasis and self-tolerance. The influence of miRNAs on T-cell differentiation and plasticity are critical in the development of chronic rejection of transplanted hearts. In this study, we sought to determine whether the knockout of miR-155 affects the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) in a murine model. miRNA microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses were performed for allograft neointimal lesion samples in chronic rejection. A model of heterotopic murine heart transplantation (bm12 to miR-155 miR-155 miR-155 regulates Th1/Th17-related inflammation in chronic cardiac rejection and may be a potential therapeutic target to attenuate cardiac allograft rejection. Despite advancements in immunosuppressive therapy, the immunologic mechanisms responsible for allograft rejection remain an important issue for both clinicians and researchers. Allograft rejection is a T-cell-dependent phenomenon and is critically dependent on inflammation mediated by CD4 'CAV', 'Th17', 'heart transplantation', 'miR-155', 'rejection'
