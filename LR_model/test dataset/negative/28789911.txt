Discovery of tricyclic dipyrrolopyridine derivatives as novel JAK inhibitors. Janus kinases (JAKs) play a crucial role in cytokine mediated signal transduction. JAK inhibitors have emerged as effective immunomodulative agents for the prevention of transplant rejection. We previously reported that the tricyclic imidazo-pyrrolopyridinone 2 is a potent JAK inhibitor; however, it had poor oral absorption due to low membrane permeability. Here, we report the structural modification of compound 2 into the tricyclic dipyrrolopyridine 18a focusing on reduction of polar surface area (PSA), which exhibits potent in vitro activity, improved membrane permeability and good oral bioavailability. Compound 18a showed efficacy in rat heterotopic cardiac transplants model. 'Autoimmune diseases', 'IL-2', 'Immunomodulator', 'Janus kinase inhibitor', 'Organ transplant rejection'
