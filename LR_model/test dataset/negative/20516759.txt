Heart transplantation in an adult patient with isolated noncompaction of the left ventricular myocardium. Isolated noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium is defined as a rare cardiomyopathy caused by intrauterine arrest of compaction of the myocardial fibers and meshwork, an important process in myocardial development, in absence of any coexisting congenital heart lesions. A lot of controversies exist about diagnostic criteria, nomenclature, origin, pathogenesis, and prognosis of this disease. Here, we describe an adult patient with isolated left ventricular noncompaction who presented with worsening congestive heart failure and was successfully treated with heart transplantation.
