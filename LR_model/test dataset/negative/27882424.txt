Influence of Transplant Center Procedural Volume on Survival Outcomes of Heart Transplantation for Children Bridged with Mechanical Circulatory Support. Transplant center expertise improves survival after heart transplant (HTx) but it is unknown whether center expertise ameliorates risk associated with mechanical circulatory support (MCS) bridge to transplantation. This study investigated whether center HTx volume reduced survival disparities among pediatric HTx patients bridged with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), left ventricular assist device (LVAD), or no MCS. Patients ≤18 years of age receiving first-time HTx between 2005 and 2015 were identified in the United Network of Organ Sharing registry. Center volume was the total number of HTx during the study period, classified into tertiles. The primary outcome was 1 year post-transplant survival, and MCS type was interacted with center volume in Cox proportional hazards regression. The study cohort included 4131 patients, of whom 719 were supported with LVAD and 230 with ECMO. In small centers (≤133 HTx over study period), patients bridged with ECMO had increased post-transplant mortality hazard compared to patients bridged with LVAD (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12, 0.71; p = 0.006) and patients with no MCS (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19, 0.57; p < 0.001). Interactions of MCS type with medium or large center volume were not statistically significant, and the same differences in survival by MCS type were observed in medium- or large-volume centers (136-208 or ≥214 HTx over the study period). Post-HTx survival disadvantage of pediatric patients bridged with ECMO persisted regardless of transplant program volume. The role of institutional ECMO expertise outside the transplant setting for improving outcomes of ECMO bridge to HTx should be explored.
