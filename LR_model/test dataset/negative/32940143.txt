Relationship of intraoperative perfusion parameters to the need for immediate extracorporeal support following heart transplantation. We sought to assess the relationship of intraoperative perfusion parameters while on cardiopulmonary bypass, including oxygen delivery (DO We included all adult (>18 years old) OHTs performed at our institution since implementation of an electronic perfusion record (March 2019-February 2020). Multi-organ transplants were excluded. The primary outcome was the need for immediate venoarterial ECMO in the OR following OHT. Univariable statistics were computed across demographic, clinical, operative, and perfusion variables, including oxygen delivery (DO Fifty-three OHT were included with a median age of 54 years (interquartile range, 45-61). The primary outcome occurred in eight patients (15.1%). A significantly greater proportion of patients requiring ECMO had ischemic cardiomyopathy (50.0% (4/8) vs. 15.6% (7/45), p = 0.02) and had preoperative ventricular assist devices (37.5% (3/8) vs. 8.9% (4/45), p = 0.03). Median bypass times were longer in the ECMO group (217 vs. 147 minutes, p = 0.001). Phenylephrine doses were nonsignificantly higher in ECMO patients (4.1 vs. 1.9 mg, p = 0.10). No significant differences were observed in single-point median DO This is the first study to examine the relationship of perfusion parameters, including oxygen delivery, to outcomes following heart transplantation. We note that DO 'extracorporeal membrane oxygenation', 'heart transplantation', 'outcomes', 'oxygen delivery', 'primary graft dysfunction'
