Beta blockers prevent correlation of plasma ACE2 activity with echocardiographic parameters in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 activity has been demonstrated to be an independent prognostic marker in Chagas' disease, equally potent as B-type natriuretic peptide. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic potency of circulating ACE2 activity in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Blood samples were withdrawn from patients with idiopathic DCM and healthy control subjects. The DCM patients were subdivided into 2 groups according to their New York Heart Association classification. The plasma ACE2 activity was measured by a fluorescence method. Plasma ACE2 activity was significantly increased in DCM patients, correlating with clinical severity. It was correlating with echocardiographic parameters in patients with DCM. Furthermore, plasma ACE2 activity had the potency to predict cardiac death and heart transplantation. However, compared with patients with Chagas' disease, the correlation and predictive value of ACE2 activity in patients with DCM was much less pronounced. Beta blocker treatment in patients with DCM was identified to prevent the association between circulating ACE2 activity and echocardiographic parameters. Although ACE2 activity in blood samples of patients with DCM without beta blockers is potent in correlating with the severity of disease and in predicting death and heart transplantation, its correlation and prediction potency are significantly diminished by beta blocker treatment.
