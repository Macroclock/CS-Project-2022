Prolongation of Cardiac Allograft Survival by Endometrial Regenerative Cells: Focusing on B-Cell Responses. Endometrial regenerative cells (ERCs) have been recently evaluated as an attractive candidate source for emerging stem cell therapies in immunosuppression, but their role in immunoregulation is not fully understood. The present study was designed to investigate their effects, especially on B-cell responses in heart transplantation. In this study, ERCs were noninvasively obtained from menstrual blood. Heart transplantation was performed between C57BL/6 (H-2 'Antibody-mediated rejection', 'B lymphocytes', 'Endometrial regenerative cells', 'Heart transplantation', 'Immunosuppression', 'Mice'
