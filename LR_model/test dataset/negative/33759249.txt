Acute kidney injury post-heart transplant: An analysis of peri-operative risk factors. Acute kidney injury is a common complication following heart transplantation, and the factors contributing to acute kidney injury are not well understood. We conducted a retrospective cohort study evaluating patients who underwent heart transplantation between 2009 and 2016 at a single institution. The primary endpoint was incidence of acute kidney injury as defined by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Secondary endpoints included 30-day hospital readmission, 30-day mortality, and 1-year mortality. A total of 228 heart transplant patients were included in the study for analysis. In total, 145 (64%) developed acute kidney injury, where 43 (30%) were classified as stage I, 28 (19%) as stage II, and 74 (51%) as stage III. Risk factors found to be associated with the presence of acute kidney injury included increased use of vasopressors and inotropes post-transplant. Protective factors included cardiopulmonary bypass time <170Â min. Acute kidney injury was found to be associated with increased 30-day and 1-year mortality.
