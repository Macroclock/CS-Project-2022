Three-dimensional echocardiographic evaluation of Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve in a patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. We report three-dimensional imaging of a rare finding of Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve in a patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which has been previously reported only by two-dimensional echocardiography. A fetal echocardiogram was performed at 19 weeks that showed a moderately hypoplastic left ventricle, severely hypoplastic mitral valve, a severely hypoplastic aortic valve, and a dysplastic tricuspid valve. Post Caesarean delivery at 40 weeks of gestation, a transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed the findings seen on the fetal echocardiogram. A three-dimensional echocardiogram was then performed, which demonstrated an Ebstein tricuspid valve with apical displacement of the septal leaflet, chordal attachments of the valve to the right ventricular outflow tract, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. The patient underwent a successful heart transplantation. '3D echocardiography', 'Ebsteinâ€™s anomaly', 'echocardiography and scans', 'hypoplastic left heart syndrome', 'tricuspid valve regurgitation'
