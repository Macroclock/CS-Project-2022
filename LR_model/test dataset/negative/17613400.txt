Observational study with everolimus (Certican) in combination with low-dose cyclosporine in de novo heart transplant recipients. This observational study reports on immunosuppression with cyclosporine (CsA) in 38 de novo heart transplant recipients receiving everolimus compared with 14 patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Mean (+/- SD) everolimus C0 blood levels remained stable within 5 to 7 ng/ml. Mean CsA C0 blood levels were reduced by 47%, from 240 +/- 57 ng/ml at 2 weeks post-transplant to 128 +/- 38 ng/ml at Month 6 and by 58% to 101 +/- 26 ng/ml at Month 12 in the everolimus group, compared to 18% from 246 +/- 54 ng/ml at 2 weeks post-transplant to 201 +/- 48 ng/ml at Month 6 and by 35% to 160 +/- 41 ng/ml in MMF patients. Efficacy was high with a rejection rate of 23.6% (everolimus) vs 28.5% (MMF) by Month 12. Mean pre-transplant serum creatinine levels of 1.67 +/- 0.59 mg/dl decreased to 1.53 +/- 0.57 mg/dl under everolimus and increased from 1.22 +/- 0.36 to 1.99 +/- 0.75 mg/dl in the MMF group by Month 12 post-transplant. However, calculated GFR declined in both groups by Month 12 (everolimus: from 71 +/- 29 to 57 +/- 27 ml/min/1.73 m2; MMF: from 73 +/- 22 to 44 +/- 24 ml/min/1.73 m2), with stabilization after 3 to 6 months in everolimus-treated patients and after 6 to 9 months in MMF-treated patients. Everolimus allows marked reduction of CsA exposure without significant loss of efficacy and also provides early protection of renal function.
