Effects of clotrimazole on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics in patients with heart transplants with different CYP3A5 genotypes. This study aimed to investigate the effects of clotrimazole on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus in Japanese patients with heart transplants with different CYP3A5 genotypes. Twenty-six patients who underwent heart transplantation between June 2012 and July 2017 were enrolled in this retrospective study. The CYP3A5 (rs776746; CYP3A5*3) genotype was determined after monitoring and analysing tacrolimus blood concentrations. The pharmacokinetic profile of tacrolimus was examined before and after the discontinuation of clotrimazole and in patients with different CYP3A5 genotypes. The CYP3A5*1/*1, *1/*3 and *3/*3 genotypes were detected in 2, 8 and 16 patients, respectively. After clotrimazole was discontinued, the CYP3A5 expresser (CYP3A5*1/*1 or *1/*3) group had a 3.3-fold median increase in apparent oral clearance of tacrolimus (0.27 vs. 0.89 L/h/kg, P = 0.002) compared with the CYP3A5 non-expresser (CYP3A5*3/*3) group with a 2.2-fold median increase (0.18 vs. 0.39 L/h/kg, P < 0.0001). Significant correlations were observed between C The effects of clotrimazole on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics in the CYP3A5 expresser patients were significantly greater than those in the CYP3A5 non-expresser patients. In addition, clotrimazole disturbed the correlation between C 'CYP3A5', 'Clotrimazole', 'Drug interactions', 'Genetic polymorphism', 'Tacrolimus', 'Transplantation'
