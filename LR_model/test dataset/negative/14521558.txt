Gangrenous cutaneous mucormycosis in a child with a solid organ transplant: a case report and review of the literature. Infections by members of the Phycomycetes class of fungi typically arise in patients with substantial underlying immunosuppression. Several clinical presentations, including that of gangrenous cellulitis, have been described. In the pediatric population, critically ill premature newborns and older children with underlying hematopoietic malignancies and/or bone marrow transplantation are affected. Presentation in children with solid organ transplants is rare. Successful therapy for this condition includes aggressive debridement of infected tissue and systemic administration of amphotericin B.
