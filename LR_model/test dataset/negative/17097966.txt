Quality of life in patients with kidney, liver or heart failure during the waiting list period. We analyzed the possible differences in the perception of quality of life among three groups of transplantation candidates (kidney, liver, and heart) to determine relevant factors. The sample included 113 patients (43 liver, 44 kidney, and 26 heart transplant candidates) with an average age of 52 years. The tools used were the "SF-36" and "EuroQol - 5D". The results showed significant differences among the kidney, liver, or heart transplant candidates (P < .001). No significant differences were detected between liver and heart transplant candidates. The patients on the waiting list to receive a kidney transplant had a better perception of quality of life.
