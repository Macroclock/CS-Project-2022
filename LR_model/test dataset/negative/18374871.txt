Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells expanded with CD28 superagonist antibody can prevent rat cardiac allograft rejection. It is well known that CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells play a central role in the suppression of autoimmunity, inflammation and allograft rejection. Therefore, therapeutic agents that capable of enhancing the number and activity of this T-cell subset are highly desirable. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of superagonistic CD28-specific monoclonal antibody (supCD28 MAb) on preferentially expanded rat naturally occurring CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg (nTreg) cells and its applicability in cardiac transplantation. A single administration of supCD28 MAb preferentially proliferated nTreg cells. The increase of Foxp3 expression and polarization toward a Th2 cytokine profile correlated with decreased production of interferon-gamma and increased production of interleukin-4 and -10 in the expanded CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg subset, which was capable of suppressing CD4(+)CD25(-) T-cell proliferation after purification. Furthermore, supCD28 MAb administration revealed that nTreg cells were preferentially proliferating in vivo and recruited into the grafts, resulting in significant prolongation of full MHC-mismatch cardiac graft survival. Our data demonstrate that supCD28 MAb targets expansion of nTreg cells in vivo and maintains and enhances their regulatory functions, which represents a major advance toward the therapeutic use of polyclonally activated Treg cells as cellular therapy for treatment of allograft rejection.
