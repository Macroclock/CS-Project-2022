Serial dobutamine stress echocardiography with Doppler assessment of the left internal thoracic artery graft after minimally invasive bypass for a patient with an orthotopic heart transplant. Select patients who have undergone orthotopic heart transplantation with proximal left anterior disease may be candidates for minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery. Combining left internal thoracic artery transthoracic Doppler flow assessment with wall motion assessment during dobutamine stress echocardiography adds to the utility of this test by focusing attention on the graft's status as well as detecting ischemia due to cardiac allograft vasculopathy.
