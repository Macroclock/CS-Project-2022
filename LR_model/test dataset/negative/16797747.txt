Evaluation of pulmonary vascular response to inhaled iloprost in heart transplant candidates with pulmonary venous hypertension. Chronic left-heart failure is often associated with the development of pulmonary venous hypertension. In heart transplant candidates this is of great significance because the healthy donor heart has to compensate the increased right-ventricular afterload. Right-ventricular dysfunction is still responsible for 19% of all early deaths after orthotopic heart transplantation. Careful preoperative assessment of pulmonary vascular resistance by right-heart catheterization is essential. Reversibility testing is generally carried out to clarify therapeutic options for the post-transplant period. The objective of this case series is to report our institutional experience with inhaled iloprost compared to the common used oxygen/nitroglycerin method for reversibility testing. Right-heart catheterization was performed in 23 patients with severely impaired left-ventricular function (EF < or = 25%, pVO2 < or = 14 ml/kg/min, NYHA III or IV) with combined pulmonary venous hypertension (TPG > 12 mm Hg and or PVR > 250 dyn x s x cm(-5)). An intraindividual comparison was performed between of the hemodynamic effect with oxygen/nitroglycerin s.l. and inhaled iloprost. The transpulmonary gradient fell significantly from an initial 16 mm Hg to 13 mm Hg on oxygen/nitroglycerin s.l. compared to 10 mm Hg on inhaled iloprost. Pulmonary vascular resistance fell significantly from an initial 344 dyn x s x cm(-5) to 270 dyn x s x cm(-5) on oxygen/nitroglycerin s.l. compared to 209 dyn x s x cm(-5) on inhaled iloprost. On inhaled iloprost a moderate systemic effect was noticed. In heart transplant candidates with pulmonary venous hypertension reversibility testing with inhalation of iloprost is a save method and significantly more effective than the combination of inhaled oxygen plus nitroglycerin s.l.
