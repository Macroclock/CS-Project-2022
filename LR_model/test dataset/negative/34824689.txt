Angiotensin II: A Multimodal Approach to Vasoplegia in a Cardiac Setting. Patients experiencing vasoplegia, a type of distributive shock, have limited options when conventional vasopressors are not appropriate or sufficient. This is especially true for patients with cardiac dysfunction, whether after heart transplant or ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation. Angiotensin II has been used in various clinical settings for distributive shock; however, its role in patients after orthotopic heart transplant or VAD implantation is not well studied. We present two cases where angiotensin II played a vital role in correcting vasoplegia for critical cardiac patients. 'Angiotensin II', 'heart failure', 'shock', 'vasoplegia'
