Myocardial viability twenty-four hours after orthotopic heart transplantation from non-heart-beating donors. Using a new preservation strategy, we investigated the performance of hearts from non-heart-beating donors during an observation period of 24 hours after orthotopic heart transplantation in a pig model. In the control group (n = 6) beating donor hearts were harvested with Bretschneider's HTK solution and transplanted orthotopically without reperfusion modifications. In the non-heart-beating donor group (n = 6) hearts were perfused with leukocyte-depleted blood cardioplegia after 30 minutes of normothermic ischemia. Blood cardioplegia was supplemented with a sodium-hydrogen exchange inhibitor and adenosine. After transplantation, a second controlled reperfusion with blood cardioplegia was performed. Preload recruitable stroke work of the left ventricle 24 hours after transplantation in the control versus non-heart-beating donor group was 108% +/- 24% versus 103% +/- 18% of baseline values. Myocardial blood flow of the left and right ventricle was increased to 146% +/- 32% and 176% +/- 51% in the control group versus 176% +/- 29% and 194% +/- 27% in the non-heart-beating donor group. Myocardial oxygen consumption was 11.2 +/- 2.1 versus 12.8 +/- 2.2 mL/100 g per minute at baseline and 11.6 +/- 2.6 versus 13.2 +/- 3.1 mL/100 g per minute after 24 hours (not significant). Histologic examination with Luxol fast blue staining revealed that 2.6% +/- 4.8% of myocytes in the control group versus 1.8% +/- 1.9% in the non-heart-beating donor group were damaged irreversibly. Recovery of donor hearts from non-heart-beating donors is comparable with recovery of organs harvested from heart-beating donors if the above-mentioned preservation technique is used. These results could encourage the use of marginal donor hearts and help to expand the limited donor pool.
