Incidence of cytomegalovirus in cardiac transplant recipients receiving induction immunosuppression with antithymocyte globulin. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in cardiac transplant recipients. Use of induction immunosuppression in cardiac transplantation may have an impact on the incidence of CMV, but literature is limited. Single-center, retrospective cohort study comparing the risk of CMV infection and disease in cardiac transplant patients receiving antithymocyte globulin (ATG) induction therapy to those receiving no antibody induction. A total of 75 patients were included in our analysis, 50 who received ATG induction and 25 who did not. CMV infection occurred in 10 (20%) and 5 (20%) patients in the ATG and No ATG groups, respectively (P > 0.99). CMV disease occurred in 10 (20%) and 4 (16%) patients in the ATG and No ATG groups, respectively (P = 0.763). The median time from transplant to CMV infection was 200.0 [142.5, 364.5] days in the ATG group vs 221.0 [192.0, 299.0] days in the No ATG group (P = 0.723). The median time from end of CMV prophylaxis to CMV infection was 94.5 [66.5, 151.0] days in the ATG group vs 53.0 [41.0,149.5] days in the No ATG group (P = 0.202). Freedom from CMV infection was highest in the D+/R+ group and lowest in the D+/R- group. In cardiac transplant recipients, ATG induction was not associated with an increased incidence of CMV infection or disease in the setting of valganciclovir prophylaxis and an initial maintenance immunosuppression regimen of primarily steroids, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus.
