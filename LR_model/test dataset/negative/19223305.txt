Aortic valve replacement in a diseased bicuspid valve eleven years after transplantation. Cardiac allotransplantation is subject to a number of chronic complications that may limit graft survival. These include allograft coronary artery disease, renal dysfunction, hypertension, and malignancy, which are largely due to the immuno-modulatory and adverse effects of transplant medications. Reoperation for native allograft disease progression is a rarer phenomenon. We report a case of aortic valve replacement for bicuspid aortic valve stenosis that occurred in a patient more than ten years after cardiac transplantation.
