[Renal graft outcome in patients with combined heart-kidney transplantation]. Improvement in surgical and organ preservation techniques and immunosuppressive therapy has permitted multiorganic transplants in patients needing both heart and kidney organs in a synchronous or asynchronous way. To review our results in renal transplants in those patients with both heart and kidney transplants. Retrospective study of the 7 patients with heart and kidney transplants performed in our Hospital. We have reviewed patients main characteristics, heart and renal failure causes, renal graft and patient outcome and complications related to renal transplant. Between 1985 and 2006 we performed 411 heart transplants; in 7 out of those 411 patients (1.7%) we performed 9 renal transplants, 2 simultaneously and 7 non-simultaneously. All patients were male; their average age at heart transplant was 51.3+/-12.2 years (24-60); the causes of the heart transplant were dilated myocardiopathy in 4 cases (57.2%), rheumatic cardiopathy in 1 (14.3%) and ischemic cardiopathy in 2 (28.5%). The average age at renal transplant was 57.5+/-11.2 years (32-68); the causes of the end renal failure were cyclosporine nephrotoxicity in 3 cases (33.3%), nephroangiosclerosis in 1 (11.1%), chronic interstitial nephropathy in 2 (22.2%), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in 1 (11.1%) and chronic rejection in 2 (22.2%). In the 2 simultaneous heart-kidney transplants cold ischemia was 4 hours long, immediate diuresis was seen in 1 case (50%) and there were no complications related to the kidney transplants. The time between the heart and kidney transplants in the 7 non-simultaneous heart-kidney transplants was 105.9+/-51.8 months (23-201 months), cold ischemia was 20.3+/-1.5 hours (18-22) and there was immediate diuresis in 5 cases (71.5%); 2 patients had no complications, 2 cases had acute renal rejection episodes, 1 case of perirenal haematoma, 1 renal polar infarction, lymphocele, 1 case of wound infection, 1 urinary infection and 2 pulmonary infections. Medium follow-up is 52.2+/-33.9 months (12-93); all patients are alive with functioning grafts with creatinine level of 1.8+/-0.43 mg/100 (1.4-2.4). Two renal grafts were lost due to chronic rejection 138 and 270 days after the kidney transplants. The immunotherapy was based on mycophenolate mofetil acid and tacrolimus, though it varied. The final renal failure associated to cardiopathies needing or having needed heart transplant does not preclude the transplants of both organs.
