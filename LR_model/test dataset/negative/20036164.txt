Excision of native heart and relocation of a grown heterotopic donor heart to the orthotopic position 14 years after transplantation. Here we report the treatment of native heart complications (aortic regurgitation, ventricular fibrillation and heart failure) following a heterotopic heart transplant by excision of native heart and relocation the heterotopic heart in the orthotopic position. The patient was a 24 year old woman who had received a heterotopic transplant at the age of 9 years from a 9 year old donor. The donor heart had grown sufficiently to allow it to support her adult circulation.
