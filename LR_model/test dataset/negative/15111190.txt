Heart transplantation in a patient with isolated noncompaction of the left ventricular myocardium. We describe a patient with isolated noncompaction of the left ventricle who presented with worsening congestive heart failure and was successfully treated with heart transplantation. The prognosis for these patients is poor because of accelerated event rates of fatal arrhythmias, thromboemboli, and profound left ventricular decompensation. Only 7 patients with isolated noncompaction of the left ventricle have been reported to have undergone heart transplantation. Herein we describe a patient with isolated noncompaction of the left ventricle who underwent successful heart transplantation.
