Left ventricular assist stand-by for high-risk cardiac surgery. Patients with severely impaired left-ventricular pump function who are eligible for heart transplantation increasingly undergo high-risk cardiac surgery due to the scarcity of donor organs. If these patients also qualify for long-term mechanical support, the latter can be used as back-up in case of postcardiotomy failure. Since 1994, 36 patients (34 male, 2 female; mean age 51 +/- 7 years) underwent coronary bypass surgery/aneurysmectomy (n = 27), aortic valve replacement (n = 4), both (n = 1), or partial left ventriculectomy (n = 4) with a long-term mechanical assist device (Novacor, HeartMate, DeBakey) and were kept on stand-by with the device. Average left ventricular ejection fraction was 23 +/- 9 %, NYHA 2.9 +/- 0.5, and CCS 2.7 +/- 0.9. An intraaortic balloon pump was inserted prior to surgery in 13 patients. In 31 patients, high-risk surgery was performed, whereas 5 patients underwent immediate device placement as coronary revascularization was deemed impossible. 6 patients had postcardiotomy failure after coronary bypass surgery and were immediately provided with a long-term assist system. There were no significant differences in risk factors between the patient subsets. All conservatively operated patients survived and left the institution after 9.4 days and are currently at NYHA 1.5 +/- 0.5 or CCS 1.0 +/- 0, respectively. 6 of the 11 LVAD patients could be bridged to heart transplantation after 43 - 418 days, and 1 patient is still on support. High-risk conventional surgery with LVAD stand-by is feasible and seems to be a valuable alternative for heart-transplant candidates.
