Mitochondrial transplantation prolongs cold ischemia time in murine heart transplantation. Cold ischemia time (CIT) causes ischemia‒reperfusion injury to the mitochondria and detrimentally effects myocardial function and tissue viability. Mitochondrial transplantation replaces damaged mitochondria and enhances myocardial function and tissue viability. Herein we investigated the efficacy of mitochondrial transplantation in enhancing graft function and viability after prolonged CIT. Heterotopic heart transplantation was performed in C57BL/6J mice. Upon heart harvesting from C57BL/6J donors, 0.5 ml of either mitochondria (1 × 10 Beating score, calculated ejection fraction, and shortening fraction were significantly enhanced (p < 0.05), whereas necrosis and neutrophil infiltration were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in the mitochondria group as compared with the vehicle group at 24 hours of reperfusion. Transmission electron microscopy showed the presence of contraction bands in vehicle but not in mitochondria grafts. Mitochondrial transplantation prolongs CIT to 29 hours in the murine heart transplantation model, significantly enhances graft function, and decreases graft tissue injury. Mitochondrial transplantation may provide a means to reduce graft failure and improve transplantation outcomes after prolonged CIT.
