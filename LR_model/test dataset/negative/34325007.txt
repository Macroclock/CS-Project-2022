Coronary Flow Velocity Reserve and Myocardial Deformation Predict Long-Term Outcomes in Heart Transplant Recipients. After heart transplantation (HTx), invasive coronary angiography is the gold standard for surveillance of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). Noninvasive CAV surveillance is desirable. The authors examined left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) and noninvasive coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) related to CAV and prognosis after HTx. Doppler echocardiographic CFVR and LVGLS were evaluated in 98 HTx patients. All-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular death, and significant CAV progression, were recorded. Median follow-up duration was 3.3 years (range: 1.7-5.4 years). Patients with low CFVR (<2.0; n = 20) showed reduced MACE-free survival (hazard ratio, 4.3; 95% CI, 2.2-8.4; P < .0001) and increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 4.7; 95% CI: 2.0-11.3; P < .0001) compared with patients with high CFVR (≥2.0; n = 78). Worsened LVGLS (≥-15.5%) was also a strong independent predictor of MACE and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Combined low CFVR and worsened LVGLS provided incremental prognostic value, even after adjustment for CAV and time since HTx. The prevalence of low CFVR increased significantly with CAV severity, and the prevalence of combined low CFVR and/or worsened LVGLS was high in patients with moderate CAV (86%) and those with severe CAV (83%). The negative predictive value of combined high CFVR and improved LVGLS to rule out significant CAV was 94.5% (95% CI, 86.2%-98.4%), whereas the positive predictive value was 39.0% (95% CI, 25.3%-54.3%). The model had sensitivity of 84.2% (95% CI, 63.6%-95.3%) and specificity of 67.5% (95% CI, 56.6%-77.2%) for one or more abnormal parameters. In HTx patients with severe CAV, a higher prevalence of low CFVR and worsened LVGLS was observed. Both measurements were strong independent predictors of MACE and all-cause mortality in HTx patients. Combined CFVR and LVGLS provided incremental prognostic value and showed an excellent ability to rule out significant CAV and may be considered as part of routine CAV surveillance of HTx patients.
