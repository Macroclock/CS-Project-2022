Angiotensin II receptors from peritransplantation through first-year post-transplantation and the risk of transplant coronary artery disease. We evaluated whether the angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors from perioperation through one-year post-transplantation predict the transplant coronary artery disease (TCAD) progression. The role of Ang II receptors (type 1: AT(1)R; type 2: AT(2)R) in TCAD is uncertain. We investigated 28 heart donors and the corresponding recipients. The levels of AT(1)R and AT(2)R messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) were examined in lymphocytes from the donor spleen and in the donor heart at one-week and one-year posttransplantation to determine their association with the progression of TCAD, measured as changes in maximal intimal thickness (CMIT) and plaque volume (CPV) by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) examinations. The AT(1)R mRNA in lymphocytes from the donor spleen (CMIT: r = 0.73, p < 0.0001; CPV: r = 0.69, p < 0.0001) and in the donor hearts at one-week (CMIT: r = 0.52, p = 0.005; CPV: r = 0.56, p = 0.002) and at one-year (CMIT: r = 0.63, p < 0.0001; CPV: r = 0.43, p = 0.004) post-transplantation along with AT(2)R mRNA in the donor hearts at one-year post-transplantation (CMIT: r = 0.3, p < 0.0001; CPV: r = 0.53, p = 0.009) were univariate predictors, whereas AT(1)R mRNA in lymphocytes and in the donor hearts at one-year post-transplantation proved to be multivariate predictors of the progression of TCAD. These data suggest a role for Ang II receptors in the pathogenesis of TCAD and support a novel concept that TCAD may have its origin in the donor per se and may be modulated by the recipient's inherent biological factors.
