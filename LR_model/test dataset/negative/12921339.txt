Heart-lung transplantation in India: initial experience. Heart-lung transplantation is a well accepted and standard form of therapy for the surgical management of patients with end-stage cardiopulmonary disorders. The first heart-lung transplant in India was performed at our institution on May 3, 1999 and, subsequently, 2 more patients have undergone this procedure. The initial experience is encouraging and heralds a new era of thoracic organ transplantation in India.
