Body image after heart transplantation compared to mechanical aortic valve insertion. Heart transplantation (HT) obviously affects body image and integrity. However, there are very few empirical data post-transplant. In a cross-sectional study, 57 HT patients were compared with 47 subjects with mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) using the Dresden-Body-Image questionnaire (DKB) and specific questions regarding integration of the organ/device. In addition, affective symptoms and quality of life (QoL) were assessed (12-Item Short-Form Health Survey and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS). DKB-35 scores did not differ. HT patients scored higher than AVR on specific questions regarding integration of the organ/device. AVR patients showed more affective disturbance and lower mental QoL than HT subjects. Affective scores correlated negatively with body image scores. Seventeen percent of all patients showed psychological distress (HADS scores >8). HT patients integrated the new organ well - and even better than AVR subjects did with the device. In general, our data corroborate a good adaptation process, in particular in HT patients. Similar to other reported data, a subgroup of 15-20% of patients shows stronger mental distress, including body image problems. These must be identified and treated by professionals. Patients with AVR deserve more attention in the future. 'Body image', 'aortic valve replacement', 'heart transplantation', 'quality of life'
