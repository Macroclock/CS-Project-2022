Troponin I levels from donors accepted for pediatric heart transplantation do not predict recipient graft survival. Troponin I is often obtained during the evaluation of a potential transplant donor heart. It is not clear whether elevations in donor troponin I levels predict adverse outcomes and should thus preclude acceptance of a donor heart. This study examined whether troponin I levels from donors accepted for pediatric heart transplantation predicted graft failure. Deidentified data on heart transplants performed in recipients aged < 21 years between April 2007 and April 2009 was provided by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Donor troponin I level and recipient outcomes, including survival without retransplantation (graft survival), were examined for statistical correlation. Overall graft survival in 839 heart transplants was 81% at 2 years. At least 1 troponin I level was recorded in 657 donors before transplant, with a median value of 0.1 ng/ml (range, 0-50 ng/ml). Troponin I level and graft status were not correlated (p = 0.74). A receiver operating characteristic curve showed no association between troponin I and graft status (area under the curve, 0.51; p = 0.98). Graft survival did not differ significantly (p = 0.60) among quartiles of troponin I levels (<0.04, 0.04-<0.1, 0.1-<0.35, ≥ 0.35 ng/ml). A troponin I level ≥ 1 ng/ml was found in 74 transplanted donor hearts; graft survival was not associated with troponin I ≥ 1 (80%) vs < 1 (80%) at 2 years (p = 0.93). Troponin I values were not associated with post-transplant hospital length of stay (r = -0.06; p = 0.10). In donor hearts accepted for pediatric heart transplantation, troponin I elevation before procurement is not associated with increased graft failure. The significance of elevated troponin I levels, which occurs in many heart donors, remains unclear and should therefore be considered in the context of other clinical information.
