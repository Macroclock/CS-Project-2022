Endovascular repair of left ventricular assist device outflow graft defect. Outflow graft complications after left ventricular assist device placement are infrequent but highly morbid.

This approach successfully stopped the outflow graft hemorrhage and temporized the patient for subsequent cardiac transplantation. 'LVAD', 'transplant'
