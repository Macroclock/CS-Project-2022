Patient "Activation" of Patients Referred for Advanced Heart Failure Therapy. Advanced heart failure (HF) is a devastating chronic illness requiring complex treatment regimens and patient engagement. Having the information, motivation, and skills to live with a medical condition are conceptualized by the term, "activation." Patients referred for advanced HF therapy and their unpaid family caregiver were invited to participate in this study by completing the 10-item patient activation measure (PAM) questionnaire. Anxiety and depression were assessed via the hospital anxiety and depression scale. We compared activation, anxiety, and depression between those selected versus not selected for advanced HF therapy (left ventricular assist device or heart transplantation). We analyzed those who subsequently underwent advanced HF therapy in regards to activation and 1-year survival. There were 133 (68%) patients selected for therapy. Neither depression nor anxiety differed by selection status, but PAM levels did (p = 0.02). Those not selected for therapy were approximately 4 times more likely to have lower activation than those who were selected (8% vs 2%). Of the 133 selected patients, 110 (84%) subsequently underwent advanced HF therapy and 15 (14%) of those died within 1 year. Survival was independent of baseline anxiety (p = 0.92) and depression (p = 0.70), as well as patient and caregiver PAM (p = 0.50 and 0.77, respectively). In conclusion, patients with higher activation were more likely to be selected for advanced HF therapy.
