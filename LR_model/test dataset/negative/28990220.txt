Low-dose basiliximab induction therapy in heart transplantation. We prospectively studied efficacy and safety outcomes of two 10-mg doses of intravenous basiliximab on day 0 and day 4 for induction therapy in 17 consecutive de novo heart transplant recipients. By the 2-week assessment post-transplant, there were no deaths, graft failures, or acute cellular rejections (ACRs) ISHLT grade ≥ 2R. By the 1-year assessment post-transplant, there were 1 (6%) infectious death, no graft failures, 2 (12%) grade 2R ACRs, 6 (35%) asymptomatic cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, and 4 (25%) treated infections. Our study was the first to show that low-dose basiliximab induction in heart transplant resulted in favorable efficacy and safety outcomes. Additionally, calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) initiation in a low-risk population could be safely delayed using the strategy of modified low-dose postoperative basiliximab. This strategy also appears to allow subsequent early corticosteroid wean, although with the concomitant maintenance of higher CNI levels and higher dosing of mycophenolate.
