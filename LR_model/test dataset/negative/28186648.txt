The recipient's heme oxygenase-1 promoter region polymorphism is associated with cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) catalyses the degradation of heme to biliverdin, free iron, and carbon monoxide. The promoter region contains a highly polymorphic (GT) 'cardiac allograft vasculopathy', 'cardiac transplantation', 'heme oxygenase-1', 'polymorphism'
