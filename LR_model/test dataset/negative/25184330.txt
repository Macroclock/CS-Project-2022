A rat model of pulmonary infection after cardiac transplant. Cardiac allograft rejection and infection are leading causes of morbidity and mortality after transplant. The lack of an animal model has hindered related research. We have developed a rat model of pulmonary infection after cardiac transplant to address this issue. Lewis rats received Wistar rat heart allografts, cardiac rejection was induced by cessation of cyclosporine injection, and pulmonary infection was induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa intrabronchial inoculation. Development of pulmonary infection and/or heart rejection was assessed by histopathology. Histopathologic findings showed that a dose of 2 Ã— 108 colony forming units of Pseudomonas aeruginosa intrabronchial inoculation is sufficient to cause severe pneumonia without being lethal to transplanted animals. Daily administration of 10 mg/kg of cyclosporine reliably suppressed rejection, and withdrawal for 7 days can obtain a consistent International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation 3R rejection. The current study represents a simple and effective rat model of pulmonary infection along, or in combination, with rejection after heart transplant, which can be used for research of infection-rejection in cardiac transplant settings.
