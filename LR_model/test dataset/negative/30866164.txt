Right atrial function in pediatric heart transplant patients by echocardiographic strain measurements. CAV is a major cause of mortality in PHTx patients. Research on echocardiographic indices to detect CAV focuses primarily on ventricular function and less is known about RAF. Thus, we primarily sought to evaluate RAF in PHTx patients with CAV. For secondary analysis, we compared RAF between PHTx patients and control patients and evaluated RAF with respect to rejection and surgical type. We retrospectively evaluated echocardiography derived RA strain indices in recipients <18 years old and >1 year from time of transplant. The RA strain phases included, reservoir (εs), conduit (εe), pump (εa), and respective strain rate indices (SRs, SRe, SRa). There were 36 PHTx patients and 14 age-, sex-matched control patients. There was a significant reduction in εs, εe, SRs, and SRe (P < 0.001) in the PHTx patients when compared to controls. There was no difference between the CAV (+) and CAV (-) patients with respect to RAF indices. Furthermore, εs, εe, and SRe (P < 0.05) were lower in patients with acute rejection (n = 7) compared to those without (n = 26). Patients with a bi-atrial anastomosis (n = 14) had decreased εs, εa, SRs, SRa (P < 0.05), compared to bi-caval anastomosis (n = 24). PHTx patients have decreased RAF compared to healthy children. RAF does not differentiate PHTx patients based on the presence of CAV. RAF is also decreased in PHTx patients with rejection and in those transplanted with a bi-atrial anastomosis.
