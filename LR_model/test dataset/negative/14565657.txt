Post-transplant Burkitt's leukemia or lymphoma. Study of five cases treated with specific intensive therapy (PETHEMA ALL-3/97 trial). Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and Burkitt-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are uncommon lymphoproliferative disorders after solid organ or stem cell transplantation. Although their prognosis is considered to be poor, there are scarce data on the clinical characteristics and the response to specific therapies. We report the main clinical characteristics and the results of a specific intensive chemotherapy in 5 adult patients with postransplant BL/ALL3 included in the PETHEMA ALL3/97 protocol. Two patients died in induction, another died in consolidation phase and the remaining 2 patients are in continuous complete remission 6 and 18 months from the diagnosis.
