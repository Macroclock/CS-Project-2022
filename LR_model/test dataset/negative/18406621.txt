Destiny of candidates for heart transplantation in the Eurotransplant heart allocation system. We analyzed the prognosis of candidates for heart transplantation (HTx) after being listed with 'urgent status' for donor heart allocation or after ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation without application for urgent status. Urgent status as used in this study refers to both the high urgency (HU) status awarded by Eurotransplant until August 31, 2005 and the urgent (U) status that replaced it from then on. Patients who underwent primary VAD implantation between January 2001 and December 2006 and who were listed as transplantable (T) (group VAD-prim, n=159), and patients listed primarily in urgent status before VAD implantation and/or HTx during the same period (group U-prim, n=168) were enrolled in the study. Group U-prim consists of subgroups: group U-HTx (n=123), who underwent primarily HTx in urgent status; group U-VAD (n=25), who underwent primarily VAD implantation in urgent status; patients who died in urgent status before HTx or VAD implantation (n=6); and patients in urgent status without HTx or VAD implantation (n=14). The survival rate in each group was studied. Survival rates after VAD implantation in group VAD-prim were comparable to those after urgent status listing in group U-prim (67.0% vs 68.5% for 1-year survival, 56.6% vs 65.8% for 2-year survival, respectively). Actuarial survival after listing for urgent status in group U-HTx was significantly better than that in group U-VAD (73.7% vs 46.0% for 1-year survival, p<0.05, log-rank test). Actuarial survival during mechanical circulatory support after the VAD implantation (censored at HTx or weaning from the device) in group VAD-prim was significantly better than that in group U-VAD (80.7% vs 56.2% for 3-month survival, p<0.001, log-rank test). In order to receive urgent HTx, HTx candidates may choose urgency listing without primary VAD implantation at the risk of failed donor heart allocation in urgent status. However, the prognosis of the patients in the latter situation is poor.
