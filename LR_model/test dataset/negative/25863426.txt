Single-centred experience with levosimendan in paediatric decompensated dilated cardiomyopathy. Children with dilated cardiomyopathy in advanced heart failure may spend a long time awaiting heart transplantation. Consequently, mechanical circulatory support is sometimes required as a bridge to transplantation. Levosimendan, a positive inotropic agent, has been reported to be safe and efficient for the treatment of paediatric heart failure. To report our experience with levosimendan in children with decompensated dilated cardiomyopathy. Paediatric patients with dilated cardiomyopathy on the transplant waiting list and with criteria for mechanical support were included in this single-centred retrospective study. Each patient received at least one 24-hour infusion of levosimendan before mechanical circulatory support was considered. Biological and echocardiographic data were analysed. Six patients were included over a 24-month period. The median age was 25.5months (7.7-34.2months); 82 infusions were performed. Median B-type natriuretic peptide concentration decreased significantly between days 0 and 2 (2443ng/L [1458-3819ng/L] vs 1358ng/L [1025-2534ng/L]; P=0.003). While only a trend was noted in left ventricular ejection fraction improvement (P=0.054 by Simpson's method and P=0.068 by the Teicholz method), the subaortic velocity time integral rose significantly between days 0 and 8 (12.8cm/s [10-14.5cm/s] vs 15.3cm/s [14.3-16.9cm/s]; P=0.041). Levosimendan seems to improve haemodynamics in children with decompensated dilated cardiomyopathy; repeated infusions may delay the need for mechanical circulatory support while awaiting heart transplantation. This therapeutic agent should be systematically considered in this setting, in addition to conventional inotropic drugs.
