Mechanical Circulatory Support: Current Status and Future Directions. Advance heart failure (AHF) is a growing epidemic with high morbidity and mortality. Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has come to offer an opportunity to improve survival and quality of life. This form of therapy however, is not free of complications and poses a challenge to apply to a broader population. Adjunct therapies in combination with LVAD therapy and advances in device technology are in the near future, which may lessen the number of adverse events. This review summarizes the history, clinical outcomes and current challenges facing LVAD therapy. Finally, future directions of LVADs in the treatment of AHF are discussed.
