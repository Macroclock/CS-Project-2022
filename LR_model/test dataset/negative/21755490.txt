[Reconstructive surgery in patients with a ventricular assist device (VAD)--an interdisciplinary challenge]. Ventricular assist devices (VAD) are implanted with a growing frequency in patients with end-stage heart failure. In spite of technical and therapeutic advances, there is still a high incidence of device infections and healing disturbances with a considerable mortality. Reconstructive plastic surgery is able to provide help in erradicating infections and covering defects. 11 patients with device infections and soft tissue defects were treated in our institution. All cases were treated with local myocutaneous or muscle flaps. Three patients had postoperative haematomas which had to be revised surgically. One patient had a persistent fistula of mediastinal origin but without clinical symptoms of infection. One patient exhibited an enterocutaneous fistula after defect coverage. Patients with VADs have a high possibility of perioperative complications. Therefore a close interdisciplinary approach with plastic and cardiovascular surgeons is absolutely essential.
