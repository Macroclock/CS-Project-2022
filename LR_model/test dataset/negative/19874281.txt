Experience with the Levitronix CentriMag in the pediatric population as a bridge to decision and recovery. Short-term mechanical circulatory support in the pediatric population with acute cardiac failure has traditionally been limited to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation given the limited availability of pediatric-sized pumps. The Levitronix CentriMag system (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA, USA) offers expanded options for short-term support for this population. We report our experience with the successful use of the CentriMag in the pediatric population as a bridge to decision after postcardiotomy ventricular failure and as a bridge to recovery after heart transplantation. The first patient was bridged to a long-term HeartMate II (Thoratec Corporation) as a bridge to potential recovery. The second patient was supported after severe graft failure post heart transplantation, with a full recovery. The Levitronix CentriMag has proven to be a versatile, safe, and effective short-term circulatory support system for our pediatric patients.
