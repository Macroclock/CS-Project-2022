Fetal Echocardiography is Useful for Screening Fetuses with a Family History of Cardiomyopathy. We screened all fetal echocardiograms performed at our institution for the past 5 years for the indication of family history of cardiomyopathy. Twenty-six patients were identified who had fetal echocardiograms performed due to a family history of cardiomyopathy. Three out of 26 patients (11.5%) had findings of decreased ventricular function and dilation consistent with cardiomyopathy. All who had cardiomyopathy on fetal echocardiography had parents with genetic mutations (2 maternal, 1 paternal), including one mother who had a cardiac transplant at age 8 for dilated cardiomyopathy. All 3 affected infants had prenatal planning for high level care and were transferred to our facility immediately after birth for cardiology evaluation and management. 2 patients required inotropic support in the newborn period. One patient was transplanted at age 2 months. One patient required ECMO support for one week and initially recovered, but subsequently required mechanical support and listing for heart transplant. We recommend patients with a strong family history of cardiomyopathy in either parent, especially those with known genetic mutations associated with cardiomyopathy, have fetal echocardiograms performed.
