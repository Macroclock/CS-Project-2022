Home inotropic therapy in children. Inotropic therapy is a well-established practice for children with advanced congestive heart failure (CHF). Traditionally, children have been maintained on inotropic therapy in the hospital under close, monitored supervision. Changes to UNOS listing criteria now allow patients awaiting heart transplantation to be discharged to home yet maintain 1B status. In adults, home inotropic therapy has been shown to be a safe and cost-effective bridge to transplantation. To date, there are limited data on the use of home inotropic therapy in children. We reviewed the safety and efficacy of continuous ambulatory home inotropic therapy in children. Data were obtained from a single institution from January 2000 to January 2007. There were 14 pediatric patients with end-stage CHF, who received home intravenous inotropic therapy. The indications for home inotropic therapy included palliative care (n = 8) and awaiting heart transplantation (n = 6). Patients ranged in age from 6 to 18 years (median 14.5 years). The majority of subjects (n = 11) received milrinone at a dose of 0.5 to 1.0 mug/kg/min, 2 received dobutamine at 5 mug/kg/min, and 1 received both agents. Duration of therapy ranged from 14 to 476 days (median 68 days). There were 26 hospital re-admissions and 4 suspected catheter infections. No unexpected deaths or pump failures occurred. Based on this initial review, continuous home inotropic therapy in children with CHF is safe with few complications. Home inotropic therapy may result in substantial cost-savings and improve family dynamics by avoiding prolonged hospitalization.
