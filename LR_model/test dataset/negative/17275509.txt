Differential white cell count relationships with human cardiac allograft rejection. The focus of research in allograft rejection has targeted the lymphocyte, with little attention given to the neutrophil. Recent data indicate that a perioperative neutrophil influx into the cardiac allograft influences early rejection. Factors that influence neutrophil transendothelial migration might offer predictive markers of rejection. We explored the relationship between the number of circulating neutrophils in heart transplant recipients and the development of rejection. Differential white cell counts were obtained prior to transplantation and concurrently with subsequent endomyocardial rejection surveillance biopsies for 53 heart transplant recipients undergoing 410 biopsies. Preoperative differential white cell counts had no relationship with rejection. In the first 3 months after transplantation, no relationship was found between contemporary differential white cell counts and rejection. However, more than 3 months following surgery, rejection grade positively correlated on univariate analysis with neutrophil counts and the usage of cyclosporine, prednisolone, and mycophenolate. There was no relationship with eosinophils or lymphocytes. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a persistent relationship among rejection severity, neutrophil count, and prednisolone usage. A significant positive association of higher steroid usage with higher rejection grades must reflect efforts to treat patients with rejection. The significant association of higher neutrophil counts with higher rejection severity might suggest a pathological contribution to rejection. However, given the neutrophilia response to acute steroid administration, we must conclude that the neutrophil association was related to steroid administration. The absence of a relationship between white cell counts and rejection suggests that functional rather than antiproliferative strategies may offer the greatest therapeutic potential.
