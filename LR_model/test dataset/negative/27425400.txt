Pre-orthotopic heart transplant estimated glomerular filtration rate predicts post-transplant mortality and renal outcomes: An analysis of the UNOS database. Pre-orthotopic heart (OHT) serum creatinine correlates with post-OHT outcomes, but there is limited information on the relationship between pre-OHT estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and adjusted short- and long-term survival and renal outcomes post-OHT. Using the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) database we estimated pre-OHT eGFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations in patients aged ≥18 years who underwent OHT between 1988 and 2013. Patients were stratified into 5 eGFR categories (≥90, 60 to 89, 45 to 59, 30 to 44 and <30 ml/min/1.73 m A total of 30,090 patients were included in the study; of these, 46.1% and 39.9% had an eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m Pre-OHT eGFR was independently associated with mortality, ESRD and kidney transplantation after OHT. There was no advantage of CKD-EPI over MDRD in determining post-OHT mortality or renal outcomes.
