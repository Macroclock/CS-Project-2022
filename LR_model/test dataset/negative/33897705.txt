The mTOR Deficiency in Monocytic Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells Protects Mouse Cardiac Allografts by Inducing Allograft Tolerance. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) can prevent allograft rejection and induce immune tolerance in transplantation models. Previous studies have demonstrated that inhibition of mTOR signaling can enhance the MDSC protective effect in heart transplantation (HTx) by promoting MDSC expansion. In addition, mTOR inhibition is related to autophagy. The present study investigated the protective mechanism of mTOR-deficient monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) in mouse HTx. Myeloid-specific mTOR conditional knockout mice were generated to obtain mTOR The mTOR deficiency promoted M-MDSC differentiation and enhanced intracellular autophagy levels  mTOR deficiency enhances the immunosuppressive function of M-MDSCs and prolongs mouse cardiac allograft survival.
