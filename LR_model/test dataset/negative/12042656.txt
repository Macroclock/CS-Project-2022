T-cell depletion and graft survival induced by anti-human CD3 immunotoxins in human CD3epsilon transgenic mice. Anti-CD3 immunotoxins are broad-spectrum immunosuppressive agents in a wide range of organ transplantation animal models with potential use in eliciting antigen-specific tolerance. However, the anti-CD3 immunotoxins used in animal studies do not cross-react with human T cells, limiting extrapolation to humans and hindering clinical development. Three anti-human CD3-directed immunotoxins, DT389-scFv(UCHT1), scFv(UCHT1)-PE38, and UCHT1-CRM9, were compared in vitro and in transgenic mice, tg(epsilon)600+/-, that have T cells expressing both human and murine CD3epsilon antigens. These immunotoxins were extraordinarily potent in vitro against human or transgenic mouse T cells, with IC50 values in cellular assays ranging from pM to fM. Systemic administration of these immunotoxins dose-dependently depleted >99% of tg(epsilon)600+/- lymph node and spleen T cells in vivo. Depletion was specific for T cells. The loss of the concanavalin A-induced, but not the lipopolysaccharide-induced, splenic proliferative response from immunotoxin-treated animals further demonstrated specific loss of T-cell function. Immunotoxin treatment prolonged fully allogeneic skin graft survival in tg(epsilon)600+/- recipients to 25 days from 10 days in untreated animals. T-cells recovered to approximately 50% of normal levels after approximately 22 days in animals with or without skin grafts; T-cell recovery correlated with skin graft rejection. All three immunotoxins elicited >100 day median survival of fully allogeneic heterotopic heart grafts. By 100 days, T cells recovered to normal numbers in these animals, but the grafts showed chronic rejection. These immunotoxins profoundly deplete T cells in vivo and effectively prolong allogeneic graft survival.
