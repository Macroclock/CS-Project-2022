Current Status of Research on Osteoporosis after Solid Organ Transplantation: Pathogenesis and Management. Improved survival following organ transplantation has brought to the forefront some long-term complications, among which osteoporosis and associated fractures are the major ones that adversely affect the quality of life in recipients. The pathogenesis of osteoporosis in transplant recipients is complex and multifactorial which may be related to increased bone resorption, decreased bone formation, or both. Studies have shown that the preexisting underlying metabolic bone disorders and the use of immunosuppressive agents are the major risk factors for osteoporosis and fractures after organ transplantation. And rapid bone loss usually occurs in the first 6-12 months with a significant increase in fracture risk. This paper will provide an updated review on the possible pathogenesis of posttransplant osteoporosis and fractures, the natural history, and the current prevention and treatment strategies concerning different types of organ transplantation.
