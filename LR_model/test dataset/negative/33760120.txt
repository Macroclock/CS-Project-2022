Protective effect of trichostatin A on CD19 Heart transplantation is widely used for the treatment of several heart diseases. Regulatory B cells (Breg cells) serve a critical role in immune tolerance. However, the role of Breg cells in immune tolerance in the context of allogeneic heart transplantation remains poorly understood. The present study aimed to explore the effect of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA)‑regulated Breg on the regulation of immune tolerance in heart transplantation. By constructing anallogeneic heart transplantation mouse model, and performing flow cytometry, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR, western blotting and carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl esterstaining assays, TSA‑regulated Breg cells and their effects on immune tolerance in heart transplantation were evaluated. The results demonstrated that TSA increased the frequency of CD19 'trichostatin A', 'CD19+ CD5+ CD1dhigh regulatory B cells', 'IL‑10', 'immune tolerance', 'cardiac transplantation'
