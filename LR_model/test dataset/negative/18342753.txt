Assessment and characterization of time-related differences in plaque composition by intravascular ultrasound-derived radiofrequency analysis in heart transplant recipients. The survival of heart transplant patients is limited by cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and IVUS-derived radiofrequency plaque composition analysis (IVUS-RF) provide further information about the process of coronary atherosclerosis. In this study we aimed to assess the time-dependent differences in disease progression in patients with CAV. Fifty-six patients were divided into three groups according to time interval after transplantation (Group I: 1 to 3 months, 18 patients; Group II, 1 to 5 years, 20 patients; Group III: 5 to 15 years, 18 patients). IVUS-RF revealed time-dependent increases in all plaque components. The largest increase was shown for fibrotic, fibrofatty and necrotic tissue between Groups I and II. Dense calcium area increased uniformly in all groups. IVUS-RF-derived plaque type analysis revealed predominantly fibrotic plaques in all groups with a decrease of frequency over time. Fibrolipidic and fibrotic-calcific plaques increased uniformly. High-risk lesions, such as thick-cap fibroatheromas (FAs), increased in Groups I and II and decreased in Group III. Thin-cap FAs were detected only in Group III. IVUS-RF, as compared with gray-scale IVUS, provides better detailed information about the development of CAV by plaque morphology and composition analysis in different stages after heart transplantation. Serial IVUS-RF analysis in these patients may improve the stratification of heart transplant recipients.
