Molecular Diagnostic Testing in Cardiac Transplantation. Acute rejection is one of the most feared complications of cardiac transplantation. Developing non-invasive methods for detection and surveillance of acute rejection have long been a goal for post-transplant care. Here, we will review molecular diagnostic tests that are currently in use or under development to diagnose acute cellular rejection after cardiac transplantation. Gene expression, microRNA, molecular microscope, and cell-free DNA assays offer non-invasive alternatives to the endomyocardial biopsy for acute rejection surveillance.
