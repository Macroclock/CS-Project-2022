Toll-Like Receptor 3 Activator Preconditioning Enhances Modulatory Function of Adiposeâ€‘Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in a Fully MHC-Mismatched Murine Model of Heterotopic Heart Transplantation. BACKGROUND Donor-specific tolerance is the ultimate goal in organ transplantation. Diverse approaches, including the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have been investigated to induce graft tolerance. Non-stimulated MSCs showed limited regulatory functions through interaction with multiple immune-regulatory cells, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs). To augment their functions, MSCs have been preconditioned with toll-like receptor (TLR3/4) agonist in autoimmune disease models, but results were conflicting. MATERIAL AND METHODS We evaluated the immunomodulatory effects of mouse adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) preconditioned with various combinations of TLR3/4 agonist and antagonists, including polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid poly(I:C)-TLR3 agonist, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -TLR4 agonist, and TAK242-TLR4 antagonist. In vitro and in vivo experiments including mixed lymphocyte reaction, cytokines measurement, Tregs analysis, and a fully mismatched MHC heterotopic heart transplantation in mice (BALB/c to C57BL/6) were conducted. RESULTS ADSCs preconditioned with poly(I:C) showed the highest efficiency in inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation, which was correlated with the upregulation of fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2), an effector molecule of Tregs. The mean survival of cardiac allografts was extended from 8 to 12 days by intravenous injection of a single dose of ADSCs preconditioned with TLR3 agonist. The proportion of Tregs in the recipient's spleen was significantly increased by injecting the poly(I:C)-stimulated ADSCs. CONCLUSIONS These results show that short-term TLR3 agonist preconditioning enhances the immunomodulatory efficacy of ADSCs, which can induce the generation of Tregs and upregulate the expression of FGL2, thereby improving the outcome of patients receiving organ transplantation.
