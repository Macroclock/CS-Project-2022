Hypomagnesemia after heart transplantation or left ventricular assist device implant for end-stage heart failure. Patients with advanced heart failure undergoing heart transplant (HTx) or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implant are at high risk of magnesium deficiency, that may favor development of diabetes. We aimed to comparatively assess prevalence and correlates of hypomagnesemia during cardiac rehabilitation between 51 HTx and 46 LVAD recipients. We measured serum magnesium and correlated it to clinical and laboratory findings upon admission (T Hypomagnesemia is rare in LVAD recipients, but common within 1Â month from HTx, worsens during rehabilitation, despite immunosuppression tapering and magnesium supplements, and is independently associated to increasing glucose levels. Studies evaluating whether correcting hypomagnesemia improves outcome are warranted. 'cardiac rehabilitation', 'heart transplant', 'hypomagnesemia', 'left ventricular assist device'
