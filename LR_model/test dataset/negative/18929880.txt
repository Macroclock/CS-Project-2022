Cardiac transplantation for congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries: a case report. Orthotopic heart transplantation (HTx) was successfully performed in a 46-year-old man with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries. Because of the need for an extraordinary length of aorta, we preserved the aortic arch during harvesting of the donor organ. The allograft was implanted using a biatrial technique, but the heart might have to be rotated clockwise due to the posteriorlyy located pulmonary artery. The patient was well at 4 years after HTx. HTx in corrected transposition of the great arteries is technically feasible. Preservation of the aortic arch of the donor's heart may be necessary to achieve a good anatomic correction. The long-term results of such an operation are as good as other HTx procedures.
