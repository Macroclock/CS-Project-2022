[Atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease: what role for Herpesviridae?]. Herpesviridae are ubiquitous, and are commonly involved in well identified diseases as genital herpes, chickenpox and herpes zoster, infectious mononucleosis, exanthem subitum... They are responsible for latent and chronic infections after primary infection. Atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease are diseases which are very different, and for which pathogenesis remains unknown. Several authors have hypothesized that Herpesviridae could play a role in such diseases. The present paper reviews arguments not only in favour but also against such hypothesis. Any formal conclusion is impossible, and more extensive studies are warranted.
