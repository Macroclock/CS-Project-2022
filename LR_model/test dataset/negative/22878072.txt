Viremia after lung transplant: a cohort study on risk factors and symptoms associated with detection of Epstein-Barr virus. Background-The frequency and impact of detection of Epstein-Barr virus in the blood of lung and heart-lung transplant recipients in the postoperative period is poorly characterized.Objective-To investigate the frequency of virus detection, associated clinical symptoms and risk factors, and influence of virus detection on outcome.Methods-A cohort of 98 lung transplant recipients were monitored for Epstein-Barr virus in blood before transplant and during their posttransplant hospital stay (median 4 weeks, range 1-21 weeks). Patients were followed up for retransplant or death for a median of 17 months.Results-Epstein-Barr virus DNA was detected in 15 recipients (18.1%) before and in 39 recipients (41.5%) after transplant. Median viral load after transplant was 2300 copies per milliliter of blood (range, 900-45 000 copies/mL). Detection of Epstein-Barr virus DNA before transplant and mechanical ventilation before transplant were associated with detection of Epstein-Barr virus DNA after transplant. Shortness of breath, fatigue, and hoarseness were associated with detection of viral DNA after transplant. The incidence of retransplant or death was not increased in recipients who had viral DNA detected in their blood.Conclusions-Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the blood before transplant and mechanical ventilation before transplant were associated with detection of viral DNA after transplant. Detection of viral DNA after transplant was frequent and clinically relevant.
