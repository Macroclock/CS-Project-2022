Case Report: First Reported Combined Heart-Liver Transplant in a Patient With a Congenital Solitary Kidney. We report a case of successful combined heart liver transplant in a patient with a congenital solitary kidney. The patient had normal renal function before combined heart-liver transplantation and developed acute kidney injury requiring slow continuous dialysis and subsequent intermittent dialysis for almost 8 weeks post transplantation. Her renal function recovered and she remains off dialysis now 7 months post transplantation. She only currently has mild chronic renal insufficiency. We believe this is the first reported case of successful heart liver transplant in a patient with a congenital solitary kidney.
