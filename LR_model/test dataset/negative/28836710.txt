Airway plaque presenting after alteration of immunosuppression in a pediatric patient remote from heart transplantation. Success after solid organ transplantation is dependent on the proper balance of immunosuppression to prevent rejection of the allograft while limiting the risk of developing infections and malignancy. We present a 9-year-old girl, remote from transplant, who presented with airway plaque after a change in immunosuppression to include the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus. Differential diagnosis included direct medication side effect, infection, and neoplasia.
