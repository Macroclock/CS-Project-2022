Identification of pathogenic gene mutations in  Genetic variants that cause haploinsufficiency account for many autosomal dominant (AD) disorders. Gene-based diagnosis classifies variants that alter canonical splice signals as pathogenic, but due to imperfect understanding of RNA splice signals other variants that may create or eliminate splice sites are often clinically classified as variants of unknown significance (VUS). To improve recognition of pathogenic splice-altering variants in AD disorders, we used computational tools to prioritize VUS and developed a cell-based minigene splicing assay to confirm aberrant splicing. Using this two-step procedure we evaluated all rare variants in two AD cardiomyopathy genes, lamin A/C ( 'LMNA', 'MYBPC3', 'VUS', 'cardiomyopathy', 'splicing'
