Effect of left ventricular reverse remodeling on long-term prognosis after therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers and β blockers in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. It remains unknown whether left ventricular (LV) reverse remodeling (LVRR) after therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers and β blockers is correlated with prognosis in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Forty-two patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy treated with the therapy were studied. Complete left ventricular reverse remodeling was defined as LV end-diastolic dimension ≤ 55 mm and fractional shortening ≥ 25% at the last echocardiographic assessment. The incidence of complete LVRR was significantly higher in patients who survived than in those who died or underwent heart transplantation. Patients were divided into 3 groups: death or transplantation, alive with complete LVRR, and alive without complete LVRR. Although patients who died or underwent transplantation did not show any LV improvements, those with complete LVRR showed significant improvements at 1 to 6 months after starting the therapy. Patients without complete LVRR also showed small but significant improvements at 1 to 6 months. The decrease in LV end-systolic dimension from the initial value to that at 1 to 6 months was an independent determinant of future cardiac death or transplantation. In conclusion, complete LVRR is related to favorable prognosis in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The extent of left ventricular reverse remodeling at 1 to 6 months after starting the therapy is predictive of long-term prognosis.
