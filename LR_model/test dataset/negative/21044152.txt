Acute cholecystitis preceding mycotic aortic pseudoaneurysm in a heart transplant recipient. Mycotic pseudoaneurysm is a rare complication after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). This case describes a middle-aged OHT recipient who developed a mycotic pseudoaneurysm after an episode of acute cholecystitis. The region of involved aorta was effectively repaired using a patch of bovine pericardium and a brief period of hypothermic circulatory arrest.
