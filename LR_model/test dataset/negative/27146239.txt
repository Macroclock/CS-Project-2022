Use of an Intrapericardial Continuous Flow Ventricular Assist Device in a 4-Year-Old Child Weighing 12 Kilograms. Ventricular assist devices are implanted in patients with intractable heart failure as a bridge to cardiac transplantation to support the circulatory system mechanically. We present a report of a continuous flow ventricular assist device successfully placed as a bridge to transplantation in the intrapericardium of a petite-sized child with a BSA of 0.56 m2. Not only is the use of an intrapericardial, continuous-flow, centrifugal pump feasible for destination therapy, but also for low-weight pediatric patients with end-stage heart failure as a bridge to transplantation when there is chronic shortage of donor organs for heart transplantation. Consequently, the HeartWare system has been implanted in smaller patients with acceptable results, and this patient may be the youngest ever reported.
