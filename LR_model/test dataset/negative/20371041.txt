Heart transplantation in children. In the last 40 years, orthotopic heart transplantation has been established as a realistic treatment strategy for infants and children with severe forms of congenital heart disease and cardiomyopathy. The evaluation, management, and outcomes of these patients have continued to improve. These achievements have advanced pediatric cardiac transplantation and allowed more attention to be focused on improving quality of life after transplantation and reducing the long-term complications.
