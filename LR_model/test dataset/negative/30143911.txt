Severe Cardiomyopathy Due to Arthroprosthetic Cobaltism: Report of Two Cases with Different Outcomes. Cobalt-induced cardiomyopathy is a well-known but uncommon disease, and the physician must maintain a high index of suspicion in order to make a timely diagnosis. We report two patients with cobalt-induced cardiomyopathy. Both patients developed progressively worsening symptoms of cobalt toxicity following revision of a fractured ceramic-on-ceramic total hip replacement to a metal-on-polyethylene bearing. In both patients, echocardiography showed LV hypertrophy, biventricular systolic dysfunction, and a large amount of pericardial effusion. Due to decompensated heart failure, both patients were initially considered candidates for heart transplantation. One patient was diagnosed with cobalt-induced cardiomyopathy before transplantation. He received cobalt chelation therapy and revision surgery, which led to complete recovery of heart function. In the other patient, the diagnosis was not made until the time of heart transplantation. The gross examination of the explanted heart revealed typical features of cobalt cardiotoxicity, which was then diagnosed as cobalt-induced cardiomyopathy. These cases emphasise the importance of early diagnosis and prompt treatment of cobalt intoxication. 'Cardiomyopathy', 'Cobalt', 'Heart failure', 'Metallosis', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation'
