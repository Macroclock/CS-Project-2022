Surgical therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Surgical therapies for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension typically are reserved for patients who are deemed to be refractory to medical therapy and have evidence of progressive right-sided heart failure. Atrial septostomy, a primarily palliative procedure, may stave off hemodynamic collapse from right-sided heart failure long enough to permit a more definitive surgical treatment such as lung or combined heart-lung transplantation. This article discusses indications for and results of atrial septostomy and lung and heart-lung transplantation in patients who have pulmonary arterial hypertension.
