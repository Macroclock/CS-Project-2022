Single centre 12 year experience with durable mechanical circulatory support: comparison with the EUROMACS registry. Mechanical circulatory support is an established therapy in end-stage heart failure. The EUROMACS registry was created to promote research in these patients. The aim of this report was to present our 12 year experience with the durable mechanical circulatory support devices and compare it with the EUROMACS registry. Data from the entire EUROMACS registry from January 2011 to April 2019 were included (4704 implantations in 4410 patients). During the 12 years of our experience, until April 2019,125 mechanical support devices were implanted, in 122 patients. We compare patientsÂ´ characteristics, operative data and results with the EUROMACS registry and we report the major complications during the observational period. Primary end-point (death) occurred in 40 (32.8 %) patients in our cohort during the follow-up period, representing the survival rate 75 %, 68 %, and 58 % for 6, 12, 24 months respectively, which compares favourably with the data, reported by the EUROMACS registry, the survival 66 % and 53 % after 1 and 2 years respectively. Cerebrovascular accident occurred in 7 %, a bleeding event in 32 %, significant infection (driveline) in 78 % and a device malfunction in 13 % of the patients. Forty- three patients underwent a heart transplant with hospital and long-term mortality of 11.6 % and 14 % respectively. Mechanical circulatory support is a valuable therapeutic option with excellent survival rates, nevertheless it is associated with clinically significant complications rates. The direct comparison between our cohort and the EUROMACS registry showed that early implantation strategy and mini invasive approach may improve survival rates and decrease postoperative complications (Tab. 3, Fig. 3, Ref. 16).
