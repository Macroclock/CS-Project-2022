T follicular helper and memory cell responses and the mTOR pathway in murine heart transplantation. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are valuable immunosuppressants in clinical transplantation; however, the mTOR regulation of allogeneic T-cell responses is not fully understood yet. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the effects of T-cell-specific mTOR deletion on the allogeneic T-cell responses and heart transplant survival. BALB/c heart allografts, with or without BALB/c skin sensitization, were transplanted in the wild-type C57BL/6, Mtor In the absence of donor skin sensitization, long-term heart allograft survival was achieved in the Mtor mTOR is required for Tfh cell response in murine heart transplantation. T-cell-specific deletion of both mTOR and Stat3 abrogates the memory response to heart transplants. These findings help us to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the T cell immunity to transplanted organs.
