Pulmonary nocardiosis in a heart transplant patient: case report and review of the literature. Pulmonary infection with Nocardia is an uncommon but serious infection found in immunocompromised patients. We describe a rapidly progressive pulmonary nocardiosis in a heart transplant patient. We then review the common clinical features of Nocardia infection in transplant recipients, outlining the challenges in its diagnosis and management. We also review the differences between Pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis regimens with respect to concomitant prophylaxis of Nocardia and other opportunistic infections.
