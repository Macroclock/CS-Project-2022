More than 20 years' experience of left ventricular assist device implantation at a non-transplant Centre. Over recent decades implantable left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) have increased the possibility of improved survival in patients with advanced heart failure who also benefit from a better quality of life. The aim of this retrospective survey was to review the clinical results of LVAD implantation at a low-volume non-transplant centre (Link√∂ping, Sweden) between 1993 and 2016. Our aim was also to assess the mortality and morbidity rates associated with implantation of three LVAD versions at our centre, and to compare our results with those from transplant centres. A retrospective cohort study was performed examining the medical records of patients who had a HeartMate Our main finding was a survival to heart transplantation rate of 82% among our BTT LVAD patients. The most common adverse event among our patients was infection. A higher frequency of temporary dialysis was seen in the HMII group compared to the HMI group, and the frequency of right ventricular failure was higher in our HMII material. Our data suggests that patients requiring long-term LVAD support can safely have their device implanted and cared for at a non-transplant centre.
