Is bridging to transplantation with a left ventricular assist device a risk factor for transplant coronary artery disease? Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support is associated with coagulopathy, bleeding, increased blood transfusion, and increased anti-HLA antibody production. Increased anti-HLA antibody production is associated with early transplant rejection, transplant coronary artery disease (CAD), and decreased post-transplant survival rates. We asked whether bridging to transplantation with an LVAD increases the risk of transplant CAD. We reviewed data for all adults (>18 years old) who underwent heart transplantation at our institution between 1988 and 2000. After exclusion of transplant recipients who survived <3 years, we divided the remaining cohort into 2 groups: those bridged to transplantation with LVADs (mean duration of support, 149 +/- 107 days, n = 29) and those in United Network for Organ Sharing Status 1 bridged to transplantation without LVADs (controls, n = 86). We compared groups in terms of disease cause, age, sex, donor age, panel-reactive antibody testing, crossmatching, pre- and post-transplant cholesterol concentrations, diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or treated hypertension, infections, calcium channel blocker use, transplant rejection, ischemic time, cytomegalovirus infection, pre-transplant transfusion, and incidence of transplant CAD (defined as any coronary lesion identified by coronary angiography). We considered p < 0.05 to be significant. The bridged and control groups were similar in all respects except mean ischemic time (217 +/- 58 minutes vs 179 +/- 67 minutes, p = 0.007), post-transplant cholesterol concentration (212 +/- 55 mg/dl vs 171 +/- 66 mg/dl, p = 0.007), and pre-transplant transfusion incidence (100% vs 22%, p < 0.001). The incidence of transplant CAD was similar in both groups during a 3-year follow-up period (28% vs 17%, p = 0.238) and during total follow-up (34% vs 35%, p = 0.969). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified cholesterol concentration at 1 year after transplantation as a significant predictor of CAD at 3 years after heart transplantation (p = 0.0029, odds ratio = 0.984). Bridging to transplantation with an LVAD does not increase the risk of transplant CAD. Nevertheless, aggressive prophylactic therapy to minimize potential risk factors for transplant CAD, such as increased cholesterol concentration, is warranted in all transplant recipients.
