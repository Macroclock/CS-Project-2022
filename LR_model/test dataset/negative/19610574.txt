Basiliximab and heart transplantation in Hispanics: the experience in Puerto Rico. Induction immunotherapy in addition to standard triple therapy at the time of cardiac transplantation with cytolytic antibodies has been used in recipients with pre transplant renal impairment, and to prevent rejection. Recently, anti-interlukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibodies have been used for these purposes. A retrospective study of 58 heart transplant recipients was conducted to assess the effect of basiliximab, a chimeric anti-interlukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibody on biopsy proven acute rejection, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, hospitalizations due to infection and mortality one year after transplantation. A total of 58 heart transplant patient's charts were reviewed. All patients received triple immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine or tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone post transplant. Basiliximab 20 mg on day 0 and day 4 was administered as induction therapy in a subgroup of patients. Both groups had similar pre transplant characteristics. Analysis was performed at intervals of 0-17 weeks, 18-34 weeks, 35-52 weeks, and one year overall. The incidence of acute rejection episodes, post-transplant renal function, patient survival and hospitalizations due to infection was analyzed. Twenty-seven patients received induction therapy with basiliximab and 31 patients did not. Basiliximab induction helped reduce acute rejection overall during the first year, with 22 episodes of rejection in the induction group, and 67 episodes in the no induction group. In the 0-17 weeks following transplantation there were 20 reported rejection episodes in the induction group versus 58 rejection episodes in the no-induction group, demonstrating also reduction of rejection by induction in this group. Basiliximab induction group had preserved renal function, with higher creatinine clearance at 1 year when compared to the no induction group. There were no differences between groups in terms of hospitalizations due to infections or mortality. Induction therapy with basiliximab significantly reduced the number of acute rejection within the first year after heart transplantation, without a negative impact on patient's renal function, risk of infection or mortality.
