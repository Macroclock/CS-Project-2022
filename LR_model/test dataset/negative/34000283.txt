Hospitalizations for Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Vaccine Preventable Infections following Pediatric Heart Transplantation. To determine the risk factors for acquiring a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and vaccine-preventable infections (R/VPI) in pediatric heart transplant recipients and the associated morbidity and hospital resource use. Patients <18 years who underwent heart transplantation from September 2003 to December 2018 at hospitals using the Pediatric Health Information System database were identified. Their transplant hospitalization and subsequent hospitalizations for R/VPI through December 2018 were analyzed. Risk factors for R/VPI hospitalizations were evaluated using negative regression binomial models adjusted for demographic and clinical confounders. Total hospital costs were adjusted for 2018 US$. Of 3815 transplant recipients, 681 (17.9%) had an R/VPI hospitalization during 23 746 available person-years of follow-up. There were 984 R/VPIs diagnosed during 951 hospitalizations, and 440 (44.7%) occurred the first year after transplantation. The most common causes were RSV (n = 380; 38.6%), influenza (n = 265; 26.9%), and pneumococcus (n = 105; 10.7%). In adjusted analyses, there was an increased risk of R/VPI hospitalization in patients requiring mechanical circulatory support before transplantation, patients receiving induction with ≥2 immunosuppressive agents, and patients <2 years in the first year after transplantation. The median length of stay for an R/VPI hospitalization was 4 days (IQR, 2-8 days) with a median total cost of $11 081 (IQR, $6215-$24 322). Hospitalization for R/VPIs occurred frequently after heart transplantation and were associated with significant costs. Potential strategies to minimize R/VPI include expanding vaccine use through accelerated immunization schedules, further studies of use of palivizumab beyond 2 years of age, and immunogenicity monitoring after vaccination with re-immunization based on guidelines.
