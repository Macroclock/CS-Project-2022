Maintaining the Gift of Life: Achieving Adherence in Adolescent Heart Transplant Recipients. Since the beginning of United Network of Organ Sharing data collection in 1987, a total of 8,333 pediatric patients have received a heart transplant in the United States. Because these patients now have longer graft success with improved care and immunosuppression, many of them are entering adolescence and young adulthood. Primary care pediatric nurse practitioners need to be alert to the prevalence of noncompliance with treatment in heart transplant patients, which continues to be highest in adolescence. Low compliance in adolescence increases morbidity, contributes to decreasing quality of life, and is the leading reason for graft failure and mortality in this age group. This article will review common barriers to treatment adherence in the adolescent heart transplant patient, discuss the role of the primary care pediatric nurse practitioner in preventing noncompliance, and review strategies that the primary care pediatric nurse practitioner can implement to improve compliance in this patient population.
