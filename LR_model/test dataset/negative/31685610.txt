Resilience of T cell-intrinsic dysfunction in transplantation tolerance. Following antigen stimulation, na√Øve T cells differentiate into memory cells that mediate antigen clearance more efficiently upon repeat encounter. Donor-specific tolerance can be achieved in a subset of transplant recipients, but some of these grafts are rejected after years of stability, often following infections. Whether T cell memory can develop from a tolerant state and whether these formerly tolerant patients develop antidonor memory is not known. Using a mouse model of cardiac transplantation in which donor-specific tolerance is induced with costimulation blockade (CoB) plus donor-specific transfusion (DST), we have previously shown that systemic infection with  'T cells', 'exhaustion', 'memory', 'tolerance', 'transplantation'
