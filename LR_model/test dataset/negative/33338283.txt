Crossing low/moderate-level donor-specific antibodies during heart transplantation. Donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) in patients prior to heart transplantation are associated with increased risk of rejection and can lead to longer waitlist times, but it is not known whether patients with low/moderate-level DSA at transplant have acceptable post-transplant outcomes. We performed a single-center, retrospective review to examine outcomes associated with crossing pre-existing low/moderate-level DSA. We assessed 864 patients awaiting heart transplantation between 2010 and 2018, identified 67 patients with low/moderate-level DSA and compared them to patients who were sensitized without DSA at the time of heart transplantation, as well as a control group of non-sensitized patients. Outcomes included 3-year survival, freedom from cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), freedom from non-fatal major adverse cardiac events (NF-MACE), and 1-year freedom from rejection. In the first-year post-transplant, there was decreased freedom from antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in the patients with pre-existing DSA compared with patients sensitized without DSA and non-sensitized patients. However, the DSA group experienced similar 3-year post-transplant survival, freedom from CAV, and freedom from NF-MACE compared with the other study groups. Our findings suggest that crossing low/moderate-level DSA does not lead to worse outcomes in heart transplantation and may offer a viable way to increase a sensitized patient's chance to obtain a suitable donor.
