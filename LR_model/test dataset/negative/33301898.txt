Cytomegalovirus chemokine receptor M33 knockout reduces chronic allograft rejection in a murine aortic transplant model. Numerous studies suggest that cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection may act as isolated risk factor in the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). Viral G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are thought to contribute to the pathogenic changes associated with CMV infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of murine cytomegalovirus GPCR M33 in the development of CAV in a murine aortic allograft model. MHC I-mismatched aortas of C.B10 (H2 Active viral replication was demonstrated and MCMV presence was confirmed by PCR within spleen, liver, salivary glands, lung and the aortic transplant. Infection with delM33 resulted in significantly less intimal proliferation compared to WT-MCMV but more pronounced proliferation than in mock-infected allografts (32.19% [delM33] vs. 41.71% [WT-MCMV] vs. 24.33% [MCMV-]). Intragraft expression of most analyzed genes was significantly increased in infected mice. VCAM-1, ICAM-1, PDGFÎ², CXCR3 and Granzyme B were distinctly less expressed in grafts of delM33 infected compared to WT infected mice. Cellular infiltration revealed reduced dendritic cells and T cells in grafts infected with delM33 compared to WT MCMV. These data suggest that the MCMV encoded receptor M33 plays an important role as a viral effector mechanism contributing to the development of CAV in a murine aortic transplant model.
