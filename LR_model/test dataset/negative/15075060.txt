Nontransplant surgical options for congestive heart failure. Although advanced heart failure has been considered the main indication for heart transplantation, the increasing number of candidates and shortage of organs for transplantation, with accumulating waiting lists, has originated another look into more conventional surgery, previously considered of prohibitive risk. In fact, many cases are a result of anatomic lesions that can be corrected by conventional surgery, and in the past decade many surgical groups have obtained good and even excellent results in the treatment of aortic stenosis with low output, and in aortic and mitral regurgitation with severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Also, ischemic and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy have been successfully treated by several types of LV remodeling surgery, with or without coronary grafting. Many of these procedures achieved excellent operative, medium-, and long-term results and survival, which match well those observed with cardiac transplantation, most often with advantages in the quality of life and, not unimportantly, in financial costs. For operated patients, especially those with ischemic cardiomyopathy, close follow-up for cardiac failure is extremely important in order to detect the right moment for heart transplantation, if it becomes necessary.
