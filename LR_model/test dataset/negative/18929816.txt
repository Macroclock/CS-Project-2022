Cardiac arrest after methylprednisolone pulse therapy rescued using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with acute cardiac rejection: two case reports. Patients receive methylprednisolone pulse therapy (MPT) when acute cardiac rejection occurs. Although the regimen is generally safe and effective, severe complications occasionally develop. From 1997 to 2007, there were 210 cardiac transplantation procedures performed at our hospital. Among these patients, there were 23 episodes of acute rejection treated with MPT, 10 mg/kg/d. Two patients in our series had cardiac arrest within 36 hours after initiating the therapy. Endomyocardial biopsy specimens showed International Society for Heart Transplantation grade 1B allograft rejection in both cases. Emergent intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation were performed. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was used to rescue the patients. The cardiac function in both patients recovered gradually. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 16.2% to 47% in one patient and from 27% to 30% in the other patient. One patient was successfully weaned from ECMO after 2 days of support. The other patient was discharged against medical advice because of hypoxia-related brain death after 3 days. Both patients had a history of tachyarrhythmias before initiation of MPT. Although the relationship between mechanisms of cardiac arrest and MPT is uncertain, the risk of cardiac arrest cannot be overlooked when initiating MPT, especially in patients with a history of tachyarrhythmia. Meanwhile, ECMO can serve as a rescue method if cardiac arrest occurs.
