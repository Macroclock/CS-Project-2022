Prognostic Value of Serial Echocardiography in Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) carries a high mortality. The prognostic value of echocardiographic variables at presentation and the importance of serial data are poorly explored. We retrospectively analyzed longitudinal clinical and echocardiographic parameters of children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The primary outcome was time to death or transplant after stage-1 surgery, right censored at stage 3 surgery, accounting for sequential surgical procedures. Univariable and multivariable analysis identified risk factors for transplant or mortality. Time-dependent trends in echo parameters stratified by patient survival were explored using nonparametric methods. In total 67 children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome were included. The 10-week, 20-week, and 1-year survival proportions were 77.6% (66-86), 68.7% (56-78), and 54.1% (41-65), respectively. At presentation, multivariable analysis identified a thicker interventricular septum (hazard ratio [HR], 1.64;  Conventional echocardiographic parameters at presentation and during follow-up are potential markers for transplant-free survival in children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
