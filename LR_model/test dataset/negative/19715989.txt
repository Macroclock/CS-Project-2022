Deazaadenosine prevents leukozyte evasion during acute cardiac allograft rejection by suppression of adhesion molecule expression. In the initial phase after cardiac transplantation, mononuclear cells infiltrate the graft initiating a relevant impulse for rejection. 3-Deazaadenosin (c3Ado), an analog of adenosine, has demonstrated in vitro anti-inflammatory properties. Furthermore, in vivo studies on arteriosclerosis development and septic myocardial dysfunction c3Ado revealed reduced cellular infiltration. In addition ischemia and reperfusion injury could be diminished in a pulmonary animal model. The aim of our study was to investigate the properties of c3Ado to reduce adhesion molecule expression and cellular infiltration in a fully allogeneic cardiac transplant model. Lewis rats were challenged with Wistar-Furth cardiac allografts. Untreated grafts were rejected within 7 days (group 1). In group 2, animals received 2 x 5 mg c3Ado SC per day. Grafts were harvested on days 1, 3, and 6 after transplantation for further examination (n = 4 per group and time point). Immunohistochemical examination revealed significant reduction of graft-infiltrating MHC II positive cells, T-cell receptor positive cells (R73), as well as ED1-positive monocytes and macrophages (P < .01) at days 3 and 6 after transplantation. Adhesion molecule (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) expression on days 1 and 3 after transplantation was almost completely diminished in c3Ado-treated grafts. Thus, c3Ado is able to reduce graft infiltration by preventing leukocyte evasion through the suppression of adhesion molecule expression. This may be a novel strategy to protect transplanted organs from early damage after transplantation and extend organ survival after transplantation.
