Solid organ donation in a child after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, orthotopic heart transplantation, and ventricular assist device support. Use of high-risk or marginal donors is the most viable short-term means to boost the organ supply and bridge the widening gap between the number of patients on the waiting list for organ transplantation and the insufficient numbers of organ donors. Expansion of the donor pool requires an understanding of the impact on survival likely to result from extending one or more high risk factors. Use of extended donor pool results in shorter waiting list times and limits the morbidity and mortality associated with long-term mechanical support needed to support diseased organs. In this report, we present one such example of expanding donor pool in which a pediatric patient donated a solid organ after two heart transplants and successful use of ECMO and VAD.
