Orthotopic heart transplantation through minimally invasive approach. Minimal access approaches are a trend in cardiothoracic surgery. Gained experience in these minimally invasive techniques have allowed its application to more complicated procedures, such as heart transplantation. Both classic and bicaval techniques of cardiac transplant were performed through a partial lower sternotomy in 10 end-stage heart failure patients with no previous cardiac surgery. The procedure was considered safe with adequate exposure, minimal postoperative pain medication requirements, acceptable operative times, and good long-term outcome.
