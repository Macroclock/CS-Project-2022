Case report: a thrombus in the venous reservoir while using bivalirudin in a patient with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia undergoing heart transplantation. Direct thrombin inhibitors are heparin alternatives for anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. We report a case of a large thrombus forming in the venous reservoir while using bivalirudin. We suggest that blood stasis associated with the full venous reservoir maintained in this case led to formation of a large thrombus at the top of the venous canister. Furthermore, activated clotting times may not accurately reflect the magnitude of anticoagulation when using direct thrombin inhibitors.
