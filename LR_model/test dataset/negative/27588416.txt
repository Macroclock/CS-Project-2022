Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-B Overexpressing Hearts Are Not Protected From Transplant-Associated Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury. Cardiac vascular endothelial growth factor-B transgene limits myocardial damage in rat infarction models. We investigated whether heart transplant vascular endothelial growth factor-B overexpression protected against ischemia-reperfusion injury. We transplanted hearts heterotopically from Dark Agouti to Wistar Furth rats. To characterize the role of vascular endothelial growth factor-B in ischemia-reperfusion injury, we transplanted either long-term human vascular endothelial growth factor-B transgene overexpressing hearts from Wistar Furth rats or short-term adeno-associated virus 9-human vascular endothelial growth factor-B-transduced hearts from Dark Agouti rats into Wistar Furth rats. Heart transplants were subjected to 2 hours of cold and 1 hour of warm ex vivo ischemia. Samples were collected 6 hours after reperfusion. Two hours of cold and 1 hour of warm ischemia increased vascular endothelial growth factor-B mRNA levels 2-fold before transplant and 6 hours after reperfusion. Transgenic vascular endothelial growth factor-B overexpression caused mild cardiac hypertrophy and elevated cardiac troponin T levels 6 hours after reperfusion. Laser Doppler measurements indicated impaired epicardial tissue perfusion in these transgenic transplants. Recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor-B increased mRNA levels of cytochrome c oxidase and extracellular ATPase CD39, suggesting active oxidative phosphorylation and high ATP production. Adeno-associated virus 9-mediated vascular endothelial growth factor-B overexpression in transplanted hearts increased intragraft macrophages 1.5-fold and proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 12 p35 mRNA 1.6-fold, without affecting recipient serum cardiac troponin T concentration. Vascular endothelial growth factor-B expression in transplanted hearts is linked to ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Cardiac transgenic vascular endothelial growth factor-B overexpression failed to protect heart transplants from ischemia-reperfusion injury.
