Effect of resistance exercise on skeletal muscle myopathy in heart transplant recipients. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of resistance exercise in reversing skeletal muscle myopathy in heart transplant recipients. Myopathy, engendered by both heart failure and immunosuppression with glucocorticoids, is a post-transplant complication. The sequelae of myopathic disease includes fiber-type shifts and deficits in aerobic metabolic capability. We randomly assigned patients to either 6 months of resistance exercise (training group; n = 8) or a control (control group; n = 7) group. Exercise was initiated at 2 months after transplant. Biopsy of the right vastus lateralis was performed before and after the 6-month intervention. Myosin heavy chain (MHC) composition was assessed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Biochemical assays were performed to determine citrate synthase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase, and lactate dehydrogenase activity. There were no group differences (p >or=0.05) in MHC composition and enzymatic reserve at baseline. Improvements in the training group for citrate cynthase (+40%), 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase (+10%), and lactate dehydrogenase activity (+48%) were significantly greater (p <or=0.05) than in the control group (+10%, -15%, and +20%, respectively). Oxidative type 1 MHC isoform concentration increased significantly in the training group (+73%, p <or=0.05) but decreased in the control group (-28%; p <or=0.05). Glycolytic type 2x MHC isoform increased significantly (17%; p <or=0.05) in the control group but decreased (-33%; p <or=0.05) in the training group. This is the first study to demonstrate that resistance training elicits myofibrillar shifts from less oxidative type II fibers to more oxidative fatigue-resistant type I fibers in heart transplant recipients. Resistance exercise initiated early in the post-transplant period is efficacious in changing skeletal muscle phenotype through increases in enzymatic reserve and shifts in fiber morphology.
