Administration of GAS914 in an orthotopic pig-to-baboon heart transplantation model. Long-term survival of transgenic cardiac xenografts is currently limited by a form of humoral rejection named acute vascular rejection. Preformed and elicited cytotoxic antibodies against Galalpha(1,3)Gal terminating carbohydrate chains, known as the primary cause of hyperacute rejection, are crucial for this process. We investigated whether GAS914, a soluble, polymeric form of a Galalpha(1,3)Gal trisaccharide would sufficiently minimize xenograft rejection of hDAF-transgenic pig hearts orthotopically transplanted into baboons. Orthotopic heart transplantations were performed using hDAF transgenic piglets as donors and four non-splenectomized baboons as recipients. Baseline immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus, sirolimus, ATG, steroids. In addition two animals received low-dose GAS914, and two animals high-dose GAS914. One of these baboons received high dose GAS914 and cyclophosphamide induction therapy. Serum levels of anti-Galalpha(1,3)Gal IgM and IgG antibodies, and anti-pig antibodies were controlled daily by anti-Galalpha(1,3)Gal enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay and anti-pig hemolytic assays. Histomorphological (hematoxylin and eosin, elastic van Gieson) and immunohistochemical (IgM, IgG) evaluations were performed on tissue specimens. Following low-dose GAS914 therapy survival time was 1 and 9 days, respectively. In baboons treated with high dosages of GAS914 a survival of 30 h and 25 days could be obtained. GAS914 caused an immediate and significant reduction of both anti-Galalpha(1,3)Gal IgM and IgG antibodies. However, sufficient antibody reduction was independent of dosage and form of application of GAS914. A pre-transplant GAS914 treatment was not necessary to effectively reduce antibody levels and prevent hyperacute rejection. In the early postoperative period preformed anti-pig antibodies corresponded predominantly to anti-Galalpha(1,3)Gal antibodies making them susceptible to GAS914. Subsequently, while anti-Galalpha(1,3)Gal antibodies remained low, anti-pig antibodies increased despite of GAS914 application. Corresponding to increased anti-pig antibody titers depositions of IgM and IgG immunoglobulins were detected, which were possibly non-Galalpha(1,3)Gal-specific. Following orthotopic transplantation of hDAF-transgenic pig hearts into baboons, GAS914 is able to maintain a sufficient reduction of Galalpha(1,3)Gal-specific cytotoxicity to the graft. GAS914 therefore is able to prevent not only hyperacute rejection, but also acute vascular rejection at its beginning, when serum cytotoxicity to the pig heart appears to be predominantly Galalpha(1,3)Gal-specific. A sustained prevention of acute vascular rejection, however, still requires the identification of antibody specificities other than to Galalpha(1,3)Gal.
