Bone mineral density and osteoporosis in heart transplanted patients: A single-center retrospective study at Skåne University Hospital in Lund 1988-2016. Bone mineral density (BMD) in the lumbar spine and femoral neck, the incidence of osteoporosis, and survival up to 10 years after heart transplantation (HT) were investigated in 169 patients who underwent HT at Skåne University Hospital in Lund, Sweden, 1988-2016. Within the first year post-transplantation, mean (SD) BMD decreased by 3.9% (10.1) (P < 0.001) and 9.0% (10.5) (P < 0.001) in the lumbar spine and femoral neck, respectively. The cumulative incidence of osteoporosis in the lumbar spine and femoral neck increased rapidly within the first year after HT and was detected in 17% and 13% of the patients, respectively. A higher T score before HT was a negative predictor of osteoporosis up to 10 years post-HT in the lumbar spine (HR 0.13; 95% CI 0.063-0.26; P < 0.001) and femoral neck (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.34-0.85; P < 0.001). Moreover, only 13%, 14%, and 6% of the HT patients received calcium, vitamin D, and/or bisphosphonates before HT. In conclusion, BMD drops significantly during the first postoperative year. Optimization of BMD early among HT candidates, potentially through usage of osteoporosis preventive treatment, may be a future means to prevent osteoporosis late postoperatively.
