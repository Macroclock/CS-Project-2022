Long-term results of left ventricular reconditioning and anatomic correction for systemic right ventricular dysfunction after atrial switch procedures. Systemic right ventricular failure after atrial switch procedures for transposition of the great arteries has been addressed at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital (1981-1993) and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (1993-2001) with reconditioning of the morphologically left ventricle by means of pulmonary artery banding followed by an arterial switch operation and an atrial reseptation. Thirty-nine patients (Royal Children's Hospital, 19; Cleveland Clinic Foundation, 20) with a median age of 10.8 years (range, 13 months-24 years) entered this protocol a median of 10.3 years (range, 0.5-24 years) after an atrial switch procedure. The median duration of pulmonary artery banding was 13 months (range, 0.5-5.4 years). Ten (28%) patients responded unfavorably to morphologically left ventricular reconditioning (5 mortalities: 4 transplantations and 1 PAB still in place). Twenty-four (83%) of the 29 patients who underwent an atrial switch operation and atrial reseptation survived. During a median follow-up period of 8.2 years (range, 1-16 years), 3 patients had cardiac-related deaths. All 18 long-term survivors are asymptomatic. At last echocardiographic evaluation, the morphologically left ventricular function was normal or mildly decreased in 16 (89%) patients, and all had normal or mildly decreased systemic right ventricular function with no or mild tricuspid regurgitation. Age greater than 12 years was associated with a greater probability of morphologically left ventricular failure and not completing the protocol (P =.02) and a higher operative mortality at anatomic correction (P =.02). Morphologically left ventricular reconditioning and an anatomic correction protocol should be integrated into a cardiac transplantation program when treating patients with morphologically right ventricular failure after Mustard and Senning procedures. It is an alternative to cardiac transplantation in selected patients, with good long-term results. The response to morphologically left ventricular reconditioning past adolescence is inconsistent.
