Coronary atherosclerosis of the donor heart--impact on early graft failure. Due to the shortage of donor hearts, the criteria for organ acceptability have been considerably extended and donor grafts with coronary atherosclerosis are among those offered. This study evaluated whether and to what degree pre-existing coronary atherosclerosis may be acceptable. A total of 1253 consecutive HTx recipients were investigated retrospectively for donor-transmitted coronary atherosclerosis (DCAS). Donor-transmitted coronary atherosclerosis was defined as focal atherosclerosis with stenosis of at least 50%. Inclusion criteria were absence of pre-HTx angiogram but performance of angiogram or autopsy within 6 months after heart transplantation. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test were used. Eighty-five out of 1253 (6.8%) cases were excluded, since coronary evaluation was not performed within 6 months (n=45) or hearts had undergone pre-transplant angiography (n=40). In 1086 patients no donor-transmitted coronary atherosclerosis was found (NDCAS group) and in 82 patients (7%) donor-transmitted coronary atherosclerosis was diagnosed by angiography (n=49) or autopsy (n=33). Single-vessel donor-transmitted coronary atherosclerosis was found in 53/82 patients (DCAS1 group) and double- or triple-vessel donor-transmitted coronary atherosclerosis in 26/82 patients (DCAS2/3 group). Three of the 82 patients with donor-transmitted coronary atherosclerosis were excluded since the autopsy report was unclear regarding degree of atherosclerosis. Early after heart transplantation the 30-day mortality in the NDCAS and DCAS1 groups was 12.2% versus 13.2% whereas in the DCAS2/3 group it was 61.5%. Beyond the first year the annual decrease with and without donor-transmitted coronary atherosclerosis (single-vessel disease) is comparable. Donor screening without coronary angiogram overlooks significant atherosclerotic lesions in a considerable number of cases (7.0%). Therefore, angiographic donor screening should be performed. Donor grafts with single-vessel coronary atherosclerosis may be accepted as marginal hearts; however, in our opinion, revascularisation (CABG, PTCA) should be considered. Grafts with two- or even three-vessel coronary atherosclerosis seem to have a serious risk for early graft failure. Beyond the first year the outcome of healthy grafts and grafts with donor-transmitted coronary atherosclerosis seems to be comparable.
