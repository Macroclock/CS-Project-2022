[Early diagnosis and management of cardiac allograft vasculopathy: is it time for a standardized approach?] Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) still represents the main cause of long-term graft loss after heart transplantation. Its silent clinical presentation makes an early identification difficult, with relevant implications for a standardized follow-up. Although technological advances have provided sophisticated non-invasive techniques for CAV assessment, intravascular ultrasound in conjunction with coronary angiography is still the gold standard to detect rapidly progressive CAV and to provide prognostic information during follow-up. Current guidelines recommend annual coronary angiography during the first 5 years and every 2 years thereafter. Although commonly performed, coronary angiography has multiple limitations, especially in young patients and in case of chronic kidney disease. This article aims to review the literature about the monitoring of CAV and to propose an ideal and individualized pathway for early diagnosis of CAV in transplanted patients, based on their cardiovascular risk.
