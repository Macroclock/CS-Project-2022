Histone Modification Is Correlated With Reverse Left Ventricular Remodeling in Nonischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy. Although implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) induces reverse remodeling of the left ventricle in end-stage nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. It has been shown that epigenetic modification, such as methylation or acetylation of the histone, is one of the most important upstream signals in cardiac failure. This study hypothesized that histone profiles may be modified by LVAD implantation for end-stage nonischemic DCM, in association with reverse left ventricular remodeling. Hemodynamic changes associated with histone modification profiles in the left ventricle were comprehensively assessed in 14 patients with a diagnosis of end-stage nonischemic DCM. These patients underwent LVAD implantation and subsequent cardiac transplantation in our institution (Osaka University Hospital, Osaka, Japan). Samples of normal left ventricle from 3 different people were used as a control. After LVAD support for 2.5 Â± 1.2 years, the study cohort showed a significant reverse remodeling of left ventricular function associated with histopathologic changes in the left ventricle, such as reduction of myocyte size. Although the left ventricle of the cohort histologically expressed less 3 histone methylation-related molecules (eg, H3 lysine 4 trimethylation [H3K4me3], H3 lysine 9 dimethylation [H3K9me2], and H3 lysine 9 trimethylation [H3K9me3]) compared with normal left ventricle, LVAD support reversed expression of these molecules, associated with up-regulation of H3 lysine 9 [H3K9] methyltransferase and suppressor of variegation 3-9 homologue 1 [SUV39H1] and with down-regulation of H3K9 demethylase and jumonji domains [JMJDs] in the LVAD-supported left ventricle. Moreover, expression of atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide (ANP and BNP) was negatively correlated with that of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3. The epigenetic state of cardiac myocytes (eg, as histone methylation) was substantially modulated in end-stage nonischemic DCM. LVAD support partially reversed the epigenetic state and its upstream signals, in association with pathologic and functional reverse remodeling.
