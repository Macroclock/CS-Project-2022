Pretransplant patient, parent, and family psychosocial functioning varies by organ type and patient age. The goal of this study was to compare pretransplant patient HRQOL, parent psychological functioning, and the impact of the patient's ongoing illness on the family between organ types (ie, kidney, liver, heart) and age-groups (ie, children, AYAs). The sample included 80 pediatric patients with end-stage organ disease who were evaluated for transplantation and their parents. Parents completed self- and proxy reports at patients' pretransplant evaluations. Results indicated that patients evaluated for heart transplants consistently had lower HRQOL and their parents had greater psychological distress compared to the kidney and liver groups. Within the heart group, parents and families of children (<12 years old) experienced significantly more distress and impact of the patient's illness on the family compared to those of AYAs (≥12 years old). Pediatric patients awaiting heart transplants, particularly younger children, and their parents and families may have greater psychosocial needs compared to patients awaiting kidney or liver transplants.
