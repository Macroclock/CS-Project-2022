Ventricular assistance to bridge to transplantation. In 2001, 2202 heart transplants were performed in the United States, leaving 4137 patients waiting who suffer from 30% annual mortality. Status I, Class IV heart failure patients have a 66% 1-year mortality rate and a survival approximating our worst cancers. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) first successfully bridged a patient to transplantation in 1978. LVADs have since functioned primarily thus, minimizing end-organ damage and providing rehabilitation potential for individuals awaiting transplantation. In this role, their effectiveness is well-established: they gain time for patients awaiting donors, preserve end-organ function, and provide potential for a high quality of life in and out of the hospital. This success has been the result of numerous advances in VAD technology, which this article discusses.
