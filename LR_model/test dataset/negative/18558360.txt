Intravenous immunoglobulin - indications and mechanisms in cardiovascular diseases. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is efficient in various immune mediated conditions. Various cardiovascular diseases are mediated by inflammatory processes and autoimmune mechanisms. Therefore, it seems conceivable to employ IVIG as an immunomodulating therapy in such indications. In this paper we review the possible anti-inflammatory effects of IVIG transfusion, and discuss the possible clinical implications in cardiology. Besides the established use of IVIG in Kawasaki disease, IVIG may be beneficial in some cases of heart failure, dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, pericardial diseases, neonatal lupus, in the prevention of cardiac rejection following transplantation, and in modulating atherosclerosis. IVIG has been proven to be ineffective in rheumatic fever. Although uncommon, complications may arise including myocardial infarction, renal failure and hyperviscosity. IVIG should be administered based on accepted modes of transfusion.
