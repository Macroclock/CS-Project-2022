The Syndrome of Large Healed Single Discrete Myocardial Infarct with Severe Narrowing of Only One Major Epicardial Coronary Artery and Leading to Severe Chronic Heart Failure and Orthotopic Heart Transplantation. Described herein are clinical and cardiac morphologic findings in 12 patients (age 43 to 70 years) (7 men) who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) because of severe heart failure (HF) resulting from a single large discrete acute myocardial infarct that healed and was associated with severe narrowing of only one major epicardial coronary artery. Most myocardial infarcts are associated with severe narrowing of >1 major epicardial coronary artery and result in smaller myocardial infarcts. Another unusual feature was the total infarction of the ventricular septum in 3 of the 12 patients.
