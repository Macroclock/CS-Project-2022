Inhibitory effect of wild-type P53 gene transfer on graft coronary artery disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of wild-type P53 gene transfer on graft coronary artery disease (GCAD) after heart transplantation and the underlying mechanisms. A rat model of heterotopic heart transplantation was established using Wistar rats as donors and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats as recipients. The donor hearts were collected and perfused, via the coronary artery, with 800 μl of recombinant adenovirus carrying the P53 gene (Ad-P53). Thirty minutes later, heart transplant was performed. At 5 d after the transplant surgery, the expression of the exogenous P53 gene and protein in the coronary artery tissues of the donor hearts was examined. At 28 d after the transplant surgery, tissues were collected from the transplanted hearts. The degree of coronary artery stenosis was examined, and apoptosis of the coronary artery smooth muscle cells in the donor hearts was analysed. In addition, histological changes in the vital organs of the recipient rats and the levels of serum biochemical indicators in the rats were also examined. The exogenous gene was successfully transferred into donor heart tissues and the coronary artery and was highly expressed. At 28 d after the transplant surgery, the ratio of tunica intima thickness to tunica media thickness (I/M) and the ratio of wall thickness to the lumen diameter of the coronary artery were decreased in the Ad-P53 group compared to those in the Ad-LacZ group and the control group (P < 0.05). A terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay revealed that the percentage of apoptotic coronary artery smooth muscle cells in the donor hearts was significantly increased in the Ad-P53 group compared to that in the Ad-LacZ group and the control group (P < 0.01). The wild-type P53 gene had no effect on the morphology and functions of the vital organs of the recipient rats. P53 gene transfer inhibits coronary artery intimal hyperplasia and reduces the degree of luminal stenosis in transplanted hearts. The inhibitory effect may be related to the wild-type P53 gene-induced apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells and inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. This approach is effective and safe and may have good prospects for clinical application. 'Gene transfer', 'Graft coronary artery disease', 'Heart transplantation', 'Wild-type P53 gene'
