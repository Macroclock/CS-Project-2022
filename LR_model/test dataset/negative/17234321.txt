Ultra long cardiopulmonary resuscitation with intact cerebral performance for an asystolic patient with acute myocarditis. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for 10-30 min without return of spontaneous circulation is considered to have a grave prognosis. We report a 27-year-old woman who experienced in-hospital, witnessed cardiac arrest and underwent prolonged CPR with manual chest compressions for 280 min. Adequate chest compression was monitored with femoral arterial pressure monitoring. During this time, she was alert and responsive. She was then supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for 9 days without her heart beating. After combined heart and kidney transplantation, she recovered well with intact cerebral performance. This successful case report supports the endeavours for relentless CPR efforts.
