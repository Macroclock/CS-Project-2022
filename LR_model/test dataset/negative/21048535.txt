The indirect alloimmune response causes microvascular endothelial dysfunction-a possible role for alloantibody. The causes of endothelial dysfunction after cardiac transplantation are unknown. Here, we have investigated whether the indirect alloimmune response mediates endothelial dysfunction in a major histocompatibility complex class I mismatch model. PVG.RT1 rat hearts were transplanted into thymectomized CD8 T-cell-depleted allogeneic (PVG.R8) or syngeneic (PVG.RT1) recipients. Alloantibody was assessed at 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy, the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate, and origin of endothelial cells were examined at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Endothelial function was assessed by Langendorff preparations at 1, 2, and 4 weeks. Recipients produced alloantibody and showed luminal occlusion at 1 (17.7%±8.0%), 2 (23.2%±4.9%), 4 (34.3%±5.0%), and 8 weeks (58.1%±1.8%) posttransplantation. The major inflammatory features of the allografts consisted of CD11b monocytes, CD4 T cells, and C4d deposition. At 1 week, the basal coronary flow and the vasodilator response to 5-hydroxytrytamine of syngeneic and allografted hearts were inhibited compared with normal hearts. At 4 weeks, the basal coronary flow of allografts was 54% lower than syngrafts (P<0.01), and 5- hydroxytrytamine and sodium nitroprusside did not evoke an increase in coronary flow in the allograft heart compared with syngeneic controls (P<0.01). Culture of aortic rings with antibody to major histocompatibility complex class I inhibited endothelium-dependent vasodilation to acetylcholine. Transient microvascular endothelial dysfunction occurred in syngeneic and allogeneic cardiac grafts after transplantation. Syngeneic but not allogeneic grafts recovered, suggesting the indirect immune response, consisting of CD4 T cells, monocytes, and antibody, mediates endothelial dysfunction. A possible role for alloantibody in endothelial dysfunction is discussed.
