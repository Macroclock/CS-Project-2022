Size matching in heart transplantation: Is predicted heart mass the optimal method in a United Kingdom cohort? Predicted heart mass (PHM) equations have been proposed as an alternative method for size matching in heart transplantation. We assessed association between donor-recipient size mismatch, defined using PHM equations, and survival post-heart transplant in the United Kingdom. Data from all adult patients who received a heart transplant between 1995 and 2017 were obtained from the United Kingdom Transplant Registry. PHM was calculated using published equations. Primary outcome was 1-year survival post-heart transplantation. Recipients of undersized organs had reduced 1-year survival (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.03-1.67, p = .03). Oversizing had no impact on survival (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78-1.26, p = .96). Gender mismatching had no impact on survival in the cohort matched by PHM (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86-1.47, p = .4). In recipients without pulmonary hypertension, undersizing by PHM had no impact on 1-year survival (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.61-1.49, p = .83). In recipients with pulmonary hypertension, oversizing donor RV by using PHM RV equation (PHM 'donor-recipient size matching', 'heart transplant', 'predicted heart mass', 'survival'
