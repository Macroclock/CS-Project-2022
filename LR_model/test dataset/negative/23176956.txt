One heart in 3 patients. In this report, we present a successful reuse of a transplanted heart under complex clinical conditions. Our patient was the second recipient, a 63-year-old man with end-stage heart failure due to amyloid-induced cardiomyopathy. After an uneventful postoperative course, he was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia 6 months after transplantation and died 10 months after transplantation. This outcome was determined by a malignancy in an immunosuppressed patient. Reuse of a transplanted heart in carefully selected patients is a possible alternative in an era of donor organ shortage.
