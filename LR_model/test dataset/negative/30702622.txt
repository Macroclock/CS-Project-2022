Immediate extubation after heart transplantation in a child by remifentanil-based ultra-fast anesthesia: A case report. Ventilator-associated complications comprise important fatal aetiologies during heart transplantation. Ultra-fast anesthesia might provide the most effective measure to prevent this type of complication. Immediate extubation after heart transplantation (IEAHT) has recently been reported in adult patients. However, IEAHT in children is much more challenging due to limitations in anesthesia protocols. Recently, we managed to perform an ultra-fast anesthesia protocol combined with IEAHT during a heart transplant operation in a child, who had an excellent postoperative outcome. A 13-year-old girl had been diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy 5 years before this case, due to intractable dyspnoea and cough. She received multiple medical treatments after diagnosis, with minimal effects. Physical examination findings included a bulge in her left chest and pitting edema over both legs. Moist rales could be heard in the lung. Echocardiography revealed very large heart chambers, with an ejection fraction of 17%. The patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and scheduled to undergo an emergent operation for heart transplantation. The patient underwent an ultra-fast anesthesia protocol and ultra-fast reversal during heart transplantation. General anesthesia was induced with etomidate, fentanyl, and vecuronium; it was then maintained with remifentanil-based total intravenous anesthesia. Immediately after the end of the operation, the patient was brought to consciousness with stable breathing and haemodynamics. The patient was successfully extubated on the operating table and transferred to the intensive care unit with spontaneous breathing, without postoperative mechanical ventilation. The recovery period was uneventful and the patient was discharged 1 month later without complications. Our experience, in this case, revealed that IEAHT in children is achievable if the ultra-fast protocol is performed properly and carefully, in order to prevent ventilator-associated complications.
