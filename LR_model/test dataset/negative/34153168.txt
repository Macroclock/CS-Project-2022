Incidence of herpes zoster in adult solid organ transplant recipients: A meta-analysis and comprehensive review. Chronic immunosuppressive therapy in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients can trigger latent varicella zoster virus reactivation even in those with stable graft function. The inactivated herpes zoster (HZ) vaccine can be effective in preventing post-transplant HZ, which can cause severe neuralgia or disseminated disease. This meta-analysis aims to assess the incidences of HZ across transplant organs in SOT recipients. We included 12 observational studies (6560 recipients) from a PubMed and EMBASE search of articles through October 2019 and collected data from single-center dating from January 2001 to December 2017 (3498 recipients). The pooled HZ incidence and its differences between subgroups were obtained from random-effect models and meta-analysis of variance tests using R package. The overall pooled crude incidence was 9.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.6%-10.8%). The pooled incidence was similar between sexes but significantly different between transplanted organs (P < .001). Heart transplants (HT) (n = 644) have the highest pooled incidence with 15.2% (95% CI, 12.7%-18.2%), followed by lung transplants (LTX) (n = 780) with 11.0% (8.3%-14.4%). Kidney transplants (n = 5435) have the lowest incidence of 6.7 (5.1%-8.8%). The meta-regression analysis revealed that HZ development had a relationship with past graft rejection (P = .024). These data support the need for subunit HZ vaccination in SOT recipients with a high risk for HZ, especially HT and LTX recipients, without respect to the late post-transplant period.
