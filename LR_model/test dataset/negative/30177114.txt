Assessment of Arterial Stiffness in Stable Heart Transplant Recipients. Arterial stiffness depends on both genetic and environmental factors. The aim of this study was to assess arterial stiffness in patients after heart transplant. The study was conducted between May and June 2017. Fifty patients from the Transplantology Clinic of the Institute of Cardiology in Anin, Warsaw, Poland, were enrolled in the study. Pulse wave velocity (PWV), central systolic blood pressure (CSBP), and central diastolic blood pressure (CDBP) were measured and patients' medical records were also analyzed. In the study, 50 patients aged 57.9 years on average were evaluated, of whom 88% were male patients, with average PWV of 8.94 m/s and an average time after transplant of 9.7 years. The study has shown that age (R = 0.77), total cholesterol concentration (R = 0.22, P = .017) and creatinine concentration (R = 0.34; P = .15) show positive correlation with PWV. Our data indicates that age has significant impact on arterial stiffness and the type of immunosuppressive drugs and transplant rejection episodes do not impact an increase in arterial stiffness.
