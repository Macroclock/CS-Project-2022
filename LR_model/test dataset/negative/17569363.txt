[Effect of Ginkgo biloba extract preconditioning on discordant cardiac xenografts]. To investigate the effect of ginkgo biloba extract (ginaton) preconditioning on discordant cardiac xenografts from guinea pig to rat, and explore its mechanism. Cervical cardiac transplantation model was established in the rats,which were divided into 4 groups Group 1 (cobra venom factor ( CVF) pretreatment, n = 10]; Group 2 (CVF + ginaton, n = 5) ; Group 3 Ccyclosporine (CsA); Group 4 (CVF + CsA + ginaton, n = 8]. The survival time and histopathology after xenograft were observed and expressions of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) CD68 and CD57 were detected. Pathologic manifestion of grafts showed changes of acute vascular rejection (AVR) in all groups. The mean survival time after car diac xenograft was 41 hrs in Group 1, 68 hrs in Group 2, 55 hrs in Group 3 and 74 hrs in Group 4. Expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1 ) decreased after ginaton preconditioning (P < 0. 05). CD68 and CD57 expressions were down-regulated, HO-1 expression was up-regulated, as well as the apoptotic index (Al) reduced significantly after ginaton with cyclosporine A preconditioning. Ginaton preconditioning can prolong the survival time after discordant xenograft, and significantly alleviate pathological lesion from acute xenograft vascular rejection combined with cyclosporine A.
