Pediatric ventricular assist devices: Bridge to a new era of perioperative care. Pediatric ventricular assist devices (VADs) are evolving as a standard therapy for end stage heart failure in children. Major recent developments include the increased use of continuous flow (CF) devices in children and increased experience with congenital heart disease (CHD) and outpatient management. In the current and future era anesthesiologists will encounter more children presenting for VAD implantation, subsequent procedures and heart transplantation. Successful perioperative management requires an understanding of the interaction between the patient's physiology and the device and a framework to troubleshoot problems. This review focuses on CF devices, VAD support for CHD and perioperative management of pulsatile and CF devices in the pediatric population.
