STAT-1 decoy oligodeoxynucleotide inhibition of acute rejection in mouse heart transplants. During acute rejection of cardiac transplants endothelial cell-leukocyte interaction fueled by co-stimulatory molecules like CD40/CD154 may ultimately lead to graft loss. One key player in up-regulating the expression of such pro-inflammatory gene products is the interferon-gamma-dependent transcription factor STAT-1. Hence down-regulating interferon-gamma-stimulated pro-inflammatory gene expression in the graft endothelial cells by employing a decoy oligodeoxynucleotide (dODN) neutralising STAT-1 may protect the graft. To verify this hypothesis, heterotopic mouse heart transplantation was performed in the allogeneic B10.A(2R) to C57BL/6 and syngeneic C57BL/6 to C57BL/6 strain combination without immunosuppression. Graft vessels were pre-treated with STAT-1 dODN, mutant control ODN (10 muM each) or vehicle (Ringer solution). Cellular rejection (vascular and interstitial component) was graded histologically and CD40, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, MCP-1, E-selectin and RANTES expression in the graft monitored by real time PCR 24 h and 9 days post-transplantation. Nine days after transplantation both rejection scores were significantly diminished by 85 and 70%, respectively, in STAT-1 dODN-treated allografts as compared to mutant control ODN-treated allografts. According to immunohistochemistry analysis, this was accompanied by a reduced infiltration of monocyte/macrophages and T cells into the graft myocardium. In addition, pro-inflammatory gene expression was strongly impaired by more than 80% in STAT-1 dODN-treated allografts 24 h post-transplantation but not in mutant control ODN or vehicle-treated allografts. This inhibitory effect on pro-inflammatory gene expression was no longer detectable 9 days post-transplantation. Single periprocedural treatment with a STAT-1 dODN thus effectively reduces cellular rejection in mouse heart allografts. This effect is associated both with an early decline in pro-inflammatory gene expression and a later drop in mononuclear cell infiltration.
