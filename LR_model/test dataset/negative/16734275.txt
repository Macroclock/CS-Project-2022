[Cryopreserved human heart cell transplantation--effect of cryopreservation on cell proliferation and immunogenicity]. We studied the possibility that cryopreserved human heart cells could be transplanted with some advantage. Cells derived human atrial tissues (control group (n = 13)), cryopreserved cells (cell-cryopreservation group (n = 23), and cells derived cryopreserved tissue (tissue-cryopreservation group (n = 29)) were cultured for 15 days. The cell proliferation was compared between control and cryopreservation group by growth curves. BasicFGF, TGFbeta-1, IL-6, IL-8, and cell cycle were measured at pre and post-cryopreservation. Mixed Lymphocyte-heart cell culture established by PBL and heart cells was evaluated by PBL proliferation. Transplanted cells were evaluated by visually and histology. Cryopreserved cells were proliferated much more than control cells (p < 0.0001). The growth factors were increased, and cytokines were decreased by cryopreservation (p < 0.05). The cryopreserved cell cycles were shifted to G2 + M from G1 + G0 period. Cryopreserved cells stimulated PBL less than non-cryopreserved cells (p < 0.0001). Transplanted cryopreserved cell were survived. Cryopreserved human heart cells can be transplanted, and proliferated much more than non-cryopreserved cells. Cryopreservation enables the human cells to be more prolific, and reduced the immunogenicity of them. The transplanted cryopreserved cells survived and formed cardiac-like tissue.
