Imaging in patients after cardiac transplantation and in patients with ventricular assist devices. The field of cardiac imaging and the management of patients with severe heart failure have advanced substantially during the past 10 years. Cardiac transplantation offers the best long-term survival with high quality of life for the patients with end stage heart failure. However, acute cardiac rejection and cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) can occur post cardiac transplantation and these problems necessitate regular surveillance. The short-term success of mechanical circulatory support devices (MCSD), such as ventricular assist devices (VADs), in improving survival and quality of life has led to a dramatic growth of the patient population with these devices. The development of optimal imaging techniques and algorithms to evaluate these advanced heart failure patients is evolving and multimodality non-invasive imaging approaches and invasive techniques are commonly employed. Most of the published studies done in the transplant and VAD population are small, and biased based on the strength of the particular program, and there is a relative lack of published protocols to evaluate these patient groups. Moreover, the techniques of echocardiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear cardiology have all progressed rapidly in recent years. There is thus a knowledge gap for cardiologists, radiologists, and clinicians, especially regarding surveillance for CAV and ideal imaging approaches for patients with VADs. The purpose of this review article is to provide an overview of different noninvasive imaging modalities used to evaluate patients after cardiac transplantation and for patients with VADs. The review focuses on the role of echocardiography, CT, and nuclear imaging in surveillance for CAV and rejection and on the assessment of ventricular structure and function, myocardial remodeling and complications for VAD patients.
