Recognition and management of complex rhythm disorders in heterotopic heart transplantation. Managing arrhythmias is challenging in patients who have undergone heterotopic heart transplantation because of the superimposed rhythms of the native and donor hearts. We present the case of a 43-year-old man with a previously placed biventricular pacemaker who underwent heterotopic heart transplantation and later developed acute rejection of the donor heart, which led to bradycardia and pause-dependent ventricular fibrillation. The patient remained clinically stable in the short term, likely because of partial recovery of myocardial function in the native heart. He later underwent placement of a pacing lead in the donor heart, allowing linking of the two hearts via a biventricular pacemaker.
