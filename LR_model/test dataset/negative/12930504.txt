Catheter ablation of supraventricular tachycardia in the transplanted heart: a case series and literature review. Clinically important supraventricular arrhythmias are occasionally encountered in patients following cardiac transplantation and the use of catheter ablation as a treatment has been reported. The following three cases are described: (1) atrial flutter, including electroanatomic mapping of the donor and recipient components of the right atrium, (2) a mid-septal accessory pathway, and (3) atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). A Medline database search was performed and articles addressing catheter ablation following cardiac transplantation were reviewed. The efficacy of RFA for treating various arrhythmia mechanisms was evaluated based on a summary of published case reports.
