A simplified technique for heart transplantation in rats: abdominal vessel branch-sparing and modified venotomy. Heterotopic heart transplantation in rats has been a widely used model in immunology since Ono and Lindsey published their technique. However, variable graft survival rates were reported by different authors with this method. With the development of microsurgery and new instruments, amendment of this technique became possible. The authors described an improved Ono-Lindsey method, based on branch-sparing and venotomy modifications, leading to a significantly shortened ischemia (25 min) and operation time (40 min), minimal postoperative complications, and considerably improved graft survival.
