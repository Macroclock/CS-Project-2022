Indications for heart transplantation in current era of left ventricular assist devices. Although both heart transplantation and left ventricular assist device therapy have enjoyed clinical success in the treatment of patients with end-stage heart disease, newer left ventricular assist devices currently undergoing testing are likely to have a tremendous impact on the management of these patients. Smaller, more durable devices with improved safety profiles will allow for longer duration of therapy and make biventricular support more feasible, obviating the need for the total artificial heart. In this article we review the historical aspects of both forms of therapy and highlight the current use of left ventricular assist device therapy on patients awaiting heart transplantation.
