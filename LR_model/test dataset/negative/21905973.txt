Parameters of mineral metabolism predict midterm clinical outcome in end-stage heart failure patients. We investigated to which extent disturbances in mineral metabolism predict 90-day clinical outcome in end-stage heart failure patients. Among numerous biochemical parameters, we measured serum levels of sodium and magnesium, the calciotropic hormones parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D as well as fibroblast growth factor-23 (a phosphaturic hormone) in 305 cardiac transplant candidates. Primary endpoint was a composite of the need of mechanical circulatory support (MCS), transplantation, or death. Of the study cohort, 33.4% reached the primary endpoint. In detail, 19% were transplanted (the vast majority was listed "high urgent"), 8.8% died and 5.6% received MCS implants. As determined by logistic regression analysis, all aforementioned biochemical parameters were independently related to the primary endpoint. Results did not change substantially when transplanted patients were censored. A risk score (0-5 points) was developed. Of the patients who scored 5 points 89.5% reached the primary endpoint whereas of the patients with a zero score only 3.8% reached the primary endpoint. Our data demonstrate that in addition to the well-known predictive value of disturbed sodium metabolism, derangements in calcium, phosphate, and magnesium metabolism also predict midterm clinical outcome in end-stage heart failure patients.
