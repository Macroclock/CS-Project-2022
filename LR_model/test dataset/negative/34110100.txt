Circulating growth differentiation factor-15 as a novel biomarker in heart transplant. This study aimed to examine (i) whether circulating growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is associated with acute cellular cardiac allograft rejection (ACR); (ii) a longitudinal trend of GDF-15 after heart transplantation; and (iii) the prognostic value of GDF-15 in predicting a composite outcome of severe primary graft dysfunction (PGD) and 30 day mortality post-transplant. Serum samples were collected before heart transplantation and at every endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) post-heart transplantation in de novo transplant patients. A total of 60 post-transplant serum samples were matched to the corresponding EMBs. Seven (12%) were considered International Society for Heart Lung Transplantation Grade 1R ACR, and one (2%) was identified as Grade 2R ACR. GDF-15 levels in patients with ACR were not different from those in the non-rejection group (6230 vs. 6125 pg/mL, P = 0.27). GDF-15 concentration gradually decreased from 8757 pg/mL pre-transplant to 5203 pg/mL at 4 weeks post-transplant. The composite adverse outcome of PGD and 30 day mortality was significantly associated with increased post-operative GDF-15 (odds ratio: 40; 95% confidence interval: 2.01-794.27; P = 0.005) and high inotrope score post-transplant (odds ratio: 18; 95% confidence interval: 1.22-250.35; P = 0.01). Circulating GDF-15 concentration was markedly elevated in patients with end-stage heart failure and decreased after heart transplantation. GDF-15 was significantly associated with post-transplant PGD and mortality. A lack of association between ACR and GDF-15 did not support routine use of GDF-15 as a biomarker to detect ACR. However, GDF-15 may be potentially useful to determine heart transplant recipients at high risk for adverse post-transplant outcomes. We suggest that GDF-15 levels in recipient serum can provide risk stratification for severe PGD including death during post-operative period. This novel biomarker may serve to inform and guide timely interventions against severe PGD and adverse outcomes during the first 4 weeks after transplantation. Further studies to support the utility of GDF-15 in heart transplantation are required. 'Biomarker', 'Growth differentiation factor-15', 'Heart transplant', 'Outcomes', 'Primary graft dysfunction'
