Risk factors associated with post-transplant superior caval vein stenosis in paediatric heart transplantation. Superior caval vein stenosis is a known complication following paediatric heart transplantation. Herein, we sought to assess the incidence of superior caval vein stenosis and need for intervention in a single centre paediatric heart transplantation programme. A retrospective review was performed to identify variables associated with superior caval vein stenosis and need for intervention. Patients were identified based on angiographic and echocardiographic signs of superior caval vein stenosis. Of 204 paediatric heart transplantation recipients, 49 (24.0%) had evidence of superior caval vein stenosis with no need for catheter intervention and 12 (5.9%) had superior caval vein stenosis requiring catheter intervention. Overall, patients with superior caval vein stenosis with and without intervention had more cavopulmonary anastomosis (41.7%; 20.4%), pre-transplant superior caval vein procedures (41.7%; 28.6%), and bicaval approach (100.0%; 98.0%), compared to the group with no stenosis (11.9% and p = 0.015, 12.6% and p = 0.004, 73.4% and p < 0.001, respectively). Smaller recipients and donors were more likely to need intervention. Intervention was also seen more frequently in recipients who were younger at diagnosis (4.7 years) compared to non-intervention (13.3 years; p = 0.040). Re-intervention was required in 16.7% patients (n = 2) and was not associated with any complications.
