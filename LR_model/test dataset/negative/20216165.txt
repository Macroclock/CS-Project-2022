Lung transplantation for pulmonary hypertension in children. Lung and heart-lung transplantation are accepted treatments for children with end-stage pulmonary vascular disease. This is a review of the current literature and our own experience with lung and heart-lung transplantation for children with pulmonary hypertension of a variety of causes. I reviewed the pertinent literature and our lung transplant database to acquire information and data regarding this subject. The patients include those at St. Louis Children's Hospital as well as those reported from other institutions. The major operative complications include those related to the surgical procedure itself (vascular and airway anastomotic stenoses) and those related to graft dysfunction. The 3- and 5-yr survival is approximately 60% and 50%, respectively, for children undergoing lung transplantation for pulmonary hypertension.Although these survival statistics are somewhat poor, transplantation remains the only viable alternative for children with end-stage pulmonary vascular disease failing to respond to medical therapy.
