Sex differences in eligibility for advanced heart failure therapies. We investigated sex-based differences in eligibility for and outcomes after receipt of advanced heart failure (HF) therapies. Although women are more likely to die from HF than men, registry data suggest that women are less likely to receive heart transplant (HT) or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for largely unknown reasons. We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients evaluated for advanced HF therapies from 2012 to 2016. Logistic regression was used to determine the association of sex with eligibility for HT/LVAD. Competing risks and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to examine survival. Of 569 patients (31% women) evaluated, 223 (39.2%) were listed for HT and 81 (14.2%) received destination (DT) LVAD. Women were less likely to be listed for HT (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21-0.61; P < .0001), based on allosensitization (P < .0001) and obesity (P = .02). Women were more likely to receive DT LVAD (adjusted OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.23-4.29; P = .01). Survival was similar between men and women regardless of whether they received HT and DT LVAD or were ineligible for therapy. Women are less likely to be HT candidates, but more likely to receive DT LVAD. 'disparities', 'heart failure', 'heart transplant', 'left ventricular assist device', 'women'
