[Requirements for outpatient care after implantation of a ventricular assist device : Views of patients and their relatives]. Ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation has developed into a well-established option when conservative treatment of terminal heart failure has been exhausted. Figures from 2015 make this clear: only 283 heart transplantations were performed nationwide but 959 VAD systems were implanted. It is noteworthy that the survival times with a VAD are approaching the survival times after heart transplantation. Patients with VADs have a life-long dependency on their proximity to specialists. So far, the requirements for outpatient care have not been systematically recorded from the perspective of VAD patients and their relatives. In September 2016, VAD patients (n = 30) and their relatives (n = 25) were anonymously questioned about their views on postoperative outpatient care. For this purpose, the VAD Patient Satisfaction Survey was adapted to the needs of this study. Patients with VADs and their relatives were found to experience their daily life with a VAD in a positive manner. Information, training, accessibility and regular contacts with the implantation clinic and the VAD coordinator are important pillars of outpatient care after VAD implantation. Almost 95% of surveyed patients regarded good home support as an important factor that makes life with a VAD easier. These aspects should be taken into account in the care of patients living with a VAD. 'Ambulatory care', 'Heart failure', 'Qualitative study', 'Thoracic surgery', 'VAD system'
