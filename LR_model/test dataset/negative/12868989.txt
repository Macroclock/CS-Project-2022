Soluble inflammatory markers in coronary sinus and peripheral blood of heart transplant recipients. Cardiac allograft rejection is a focal inflammation and soluble markers are released into coronary sinus (CS). We investigated whether plasma-soluble markers in CS is better to predict the clinical status of transplant recipients than in peripheral blood (PB). Between February 1998 and January 2001, 51 patients admitted for endomyocardial biopsy were included. The clinical events of the transplant recipient were recorded as: early post-transplant, long-term uneventful status, infection, acute rejection and transplant coronary artery disease. The plasma levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), ICAM-1, P-selectin, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) and troponin-I of CS and PB were determined. There were 71 blood samples. In patients within 1 month after heart transplant, there was a higher level of P-selectin, ICAM-1, CRP and troponin-I in CS and PB. In patients with infection, there was a higher level of all soluble markers except IL-2 in CS and PB. Patients with a long-term uneventful status had a lower level of CRP in PB but not in CS. Patients with acute rejection had a higher level of IL-2 in PB but not in CS. Patients with transplant coronary artery disease had a higher level of TNF-alpha in PB but not in CS. Soluble markers in CS failed to predict the occurrence of acute or chronic rejections.
