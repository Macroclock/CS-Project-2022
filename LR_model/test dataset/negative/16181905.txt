Esophageal cancer surgery in heart transplant patients. We herein report about 2 heart transplant patients undergoing surgical resection for esophageal cancer. Both were long-term survivors after orthotopic heart transplantation for dilated cardiomyopathy. One patient underwent a transthoracic esophagectomy and gastric pull-up for an early squamous cell carcinoma of the infracarinal esophagus. The second patient underwent a resection of the cervical esophagus and interposition of a free jejunal segment after neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy for a locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma in the cervical esophagus.
