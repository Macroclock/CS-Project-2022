Monotherapy with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody in a heart transplant recipient with sick sinus syndrome and posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder: a case report. Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a serious complication of organ transplantation, with an incidence of 0.8% to 20% in heart transplant (HTx) recipients, and standard treatment may be too toxic in some cases. Rituximab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that has demonstrated efficacy in patients with various lymphoid malignancies and has been demonstrated effective in combination with chemotherapy regimens such as CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone). Cardiotoxicity with CHOP remains a major concern for treating HTx recipients with PTLD, however. We present a case of an HTx recipient with sick sinus syndrome and PTLD who was successfully treated with rituximab alone, avoiding the cardiotoxicity of CHOP. The cardiotoxicity induced by CHOP should be kept in mind in HTx recipients with PTLD, especially when there is an existing heart problem in such recipients. Monotherapy with rituximab can be considered a safe choice.
