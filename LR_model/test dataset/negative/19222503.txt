Telmisartan and metabolic syndrome after heart transplantation. Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a cardiovascular risk predictor. Prevalence of MS after heart transplantation (HTx) is high. Recent data suggest a positive metabolic effect of telmisartan. To describe the influence of telmisartan on lipid and glycide metabolism in MS after HTx. Fifteen patients aged 55+/-12 yr, 88+/-25 months after HTx with MS receiving statins were followed. The reason for telmisartan administration was arterial hypertension with either drug intolerance or poor control. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein LDL-cholesterol, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein (CRP), fasting glucose, immunoreactive insulin (IRI), C-peptide and the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index were determined. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed. After initial evaluation, telmisartan 80 mg was started. After 20 +/- 5 wk follow-up, identical parameters were measured. Statistical significance was evaluated using Student's t-test. BMI, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, serum lipids and CRP remained unchanged after telmisartan. Significant reduction in fasting glucose (6.7 vs. 5.6 mmol/L, p < 0.02), IRI (8.8 vs. 8.5 U/mL p = 0.05), HOMA (7.3 vs. 5.8 mmol/L x muU/mL, p < 0.05) and C-peptide (4.0 vs. 3.3 ng/mL, p < 0.02) was found. Telmisartan had a positive impact on insulin sensitivity parameters (fasting glucose, IRI, C-peptide and HOMA) in this population. No effect on obesity, serum lipids and systemic inflammation was observed.
