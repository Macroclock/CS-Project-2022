Low incidence of coronary angiography in the evaluation process of the potential heart donor. We investigated the practice of coronary angiography (CA) on donor hearts. Between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2010, all reported organ donors aged <66 years were analyzed retrospectively. Donor charts were evaluated regarding a performed CA, its outcome, the timing of CA during the evaluation process, and reasons for organ refusal. The percentage of positive CA studies in organ donors aged ≥45 years was also evaluated. Of 292 reported organ donors, 152 organ donor hearts were declined (group 1), and 140 hearts (group 2) were transplanted. Of the 152 declined hearts, 91 hearts were found not suitable for organ offer, and 61 were not successfully allocated or were refused by Eurotransplant. CA was conducted in 17 organ donors (5.8%). In 6 donors, a previous CA was reported (all had pathologic findings), and in 11 donors, a donor CA was performed, indicating 4 pathologic and 7 negative findings (54.5% of the hearts evaluated by donor CA were transplanted). No complication or delay of the donation process was reportedly related to donor CA. Special emphasis and implementation of recommendations for CA to be part of the evaluation of donor organs seem necessary.
