Successful percutaneous intervention to acute myocardial infarction presenting with typical chest pain in transplanted heart. Allograft coronary artery disease (CAD) is the main limiting factor of the long-term survival in cardiac transplant recipients. It is present in approximately 50% of patients at 5 years post-transplant. Allograft CAD might result in congestive heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Acute coronary syndrome is a rare presentation of allograft CAD, because symptoms are usually atypical or absent as a result of cardiac denervation. However, it should be reminded that reinnervation of the transplanted heart might occur, and angina pectoris could be felt as a sign of an acute coronary syndrome. We present a 27-year-old female cardiac transplant patient with an acute myocardial infarction, who was successfully treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.
