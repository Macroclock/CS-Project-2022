Global gene expression profiling of end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy using a human cardiovascular-based cDNA microarray. To obtain a genomic portrait of heart failure derived from end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), we explored expression analysis using the CardioChip, a nonredundant 10,848-element human cardiovascular-based expressed sequence tag glass slide cDNA microarray constructed in-house. RNA was extracted from the left ventricular free wall of seven patients undergoing transplantation, and five nonfailing heart samples. Cy3- and Cy5-labeled (and reverse dye-labeled) cDNA probes were synthesized from individual diseased or nonfailing adult heart RNA, and hybridized to the array. More than 100 transcripts were consistently differentially expressed in DCM >1.5-fold (versus pooled nonfailing heart, P < 0.05). Atrial natriuretic peptide was found to be up-regulated in DCM (19-fold compared to nonfailing, P < 0.05), as well as numerous sarcomeric and cytoskeletal proteins (eg, cardiac troponin, tropomyosin), stress response proteins (eg, HSP 40, HSP 70), and transcription/translation regulators (eg, CCAAT box binding factor, eIF-1AY). Down-regulation was most prominently observed with cell-signaling channels and mediators, particularly those involved in Ca(2+) pathways (Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, SERCA). Most intriguing was the co-expression of several novel, cardiac-enriched expressed sequence tags. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of a selection of these clones verified expression. Our study provides a preliminary molecular profile of DCM using the largest human heart-specific cDNA microarray to date.
