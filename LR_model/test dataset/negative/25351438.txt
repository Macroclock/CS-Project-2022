The value of psychosocial factors in patient selection and outcomes after heart transplantation. Heart transplantation remains the gold standard treatment for advanced heart failure, although its use is limited by donor organ availability. To ensure that the rare resource of a donor heart is allocated appropriately, the evaluation of the heart transplant candidates includes extensive medical and psychosocial assessments. These psychosocial factors are critically important to understand pre-heart transplant because it is known that psychosocial evaluation and psychosocial comorbidities have a strong association with post-heart transplant outcomes. The critical factors to assess are psychological functioning, adherence to medical recommendations, and social support. These factors are likely inter-related and have been shown to have an effect on the health-related quality of life and overall survival. Recently, new tools have been developed to standardize the evaluation process. In this review, we will discuss the tools available to assess psychosocial factors in the transplant candidate and discuss the role these factors have on post-heart transplant outcomes.
