The 2018 adult heart allocation policy change benefits low-volume transplant centers. The effect of the 2018 adult heart allocation policy change at an institution-level remains unclear. The present study assessed the impact of the policy change by transplant center volume. The United Network for Organ Sharing database was queried for all adults undergoing isolated heart transplantation from November 2016 to September 2020. Era 1 was defined as the period before the policy change and Era 2 afterwards. Hospitals were divided into low-(LVC) medium-(MVC) and high-volume (HVC) tertiles based on annual transplant center volume. Competing-risks regressions were used to determine changes in waitlist death/deterioration, while post-transplant mortality was assessed using multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models. A total of 3531 (47.0%) patients underwent heart transplantation in Era 1 and 3988 (53.0%) in Era 2. At LVC, Era 2 patients were less likely to experience death/deterioration on the waitlist (subhazard ratio .74, 95% CI .63-.88), while MVC and HVC patients experienced similar waitlist death/deterioration across eras. After adjustment, transplantation in Era 2 was associated with worse 1-year mortality at MVC (hazard ratio, HR, 1.42 95% CI 1.02-1.96) and HVC (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02-1.98) but not at LVC. Early analysis shows that LVC may be benefitting under the new allocation scheme.
