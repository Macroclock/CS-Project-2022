Spontaneous regression of primary cutaneous Epstein-Barr virus-positive, CD30-positive anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma in a heart-transplant recipient. We presented a rare case of primary cutaneous Epstein-Barr virus-positive, CD30-positive anasplastic large cell lymphoma in a 64-year-old man who had received a heart transplant 11 years previously. The first presenting symptom was the appearance of erythematous skin nodules on the right leg. The lesions subsided with dose reduction of immunosuppressant alone. There was no recurrence 9 months after the first diagnosis. We propose that dose reduction of immunosuppressant alone may be an effective treatment for localized, indolent, post-transplant-related primary cutaneous lymphoma. Our case shows the importance of regular surveillance of skin cancer in patients who have received organ transplant.
