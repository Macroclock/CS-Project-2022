Pseudomyxoma originating from the interatrial septum in a heart transplant patient. This report describes the echocardiographic diagnosis of an intracardiac mass in a heart transplant patient. The typical morphology of the lesions, its attachment to the interatrial septum, and the absence of a nidus focus for thrombus formation led to the preoperative assumption that it was a myxoma. The mass was successfully excised at the time of operation and the patient had an uneventful recovery. Pathology findings revealed a thrombus. Thus, echocardiography may have limited specificity for the differentiation of intracardiac tumors and thrombus.
