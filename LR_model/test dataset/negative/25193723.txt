Living with a heart transplant: a phenomenological study. Heart transplantation is a relatively new medical treatment for end-stage heart failure. Many studies have addressed the outcomes and the complications and technical problems associated with heart transplants, but few have explored the whole clinical experience of being a heart transplant recipient. To understand and gain deeper insight into the lived experience of Iranian heart transplant recipients. Interviews of 11 heart transplant recipients were analyzed according to phenomenological guidelines set forth by Diekelmann. Six major themes emerged from 29 subthemes, depicting the meaning of living with a transplanted heart. These themes include having a new life, living with new concerns, living with vigilance, paradoxical emotions, bearing others' behaviors, and the prominent role of God in life. Heart transplant recipients in Iran experience a new life in which their faith in God helps them go through hardships and difficulties.
