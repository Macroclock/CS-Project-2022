[Cardiac allograft arteriosclerosis and myocardial necrosis]. To study the development of myocardial necrosis, fibrosis, and arteriosclerosis in cardiac allograft in order to provide a theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of anti-rejection. The recipient was pretreated with inoculation of donor splenocytes (SPC) followed by cyclophosphamide (CP). Heterotopic cervical heart transplantation was performed. The allografts stained with Hematoxylin and eosin (HE), Masson and Van Gieson were studied about inflammatory cell infiltration, myocardial necrosis, fibrosis and arteriosclerosis. Preconditioning with SPC followed by CP prolonged the survival time of cardiac allograft. Inflammatory cell infiltration, myocardial necrosis, fibrosis, and arteriosclerosis in cardiac allograft were significantly decreased. The development of acute cardiac allograft rejection originated from the epicardial area to the intimal area of the heart in rat. The infiltration of collagenous fiber in the coronary arteries is one of the major causes of concentric stenosis. The pretreatment of SPC followed by CP can prevent and relieve the rejection.
