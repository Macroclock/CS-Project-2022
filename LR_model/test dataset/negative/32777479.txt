Transition to Advanced Therapies in Elderly Patients Supported by Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Therapy. Although the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) continues to increase, very little is known about how age influences the transition to definitive advanced therapies. Using the National Inpatient Sample database from 2008 to 2017, we analyzed patients supported by ECMO for cardiogenic shock and separated patients into 2 age cohorts: < 65 years and ≥ 65 years. Primary outcomes of interest included the proportion of patients undergoing orthotopic cardiac transplantation (OHT) and left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. Over the study period, we identified 16,132 hospitalizations of people with cardiogenic shock requiring ECMO support. Significantly fewer patients in the older group underwent OHT compared to the younger group (0.4% vs 1.2%, P < 0.001). Compared to the younger group, a lower proportion of those ≥ 65 years received an LVAD (3.7% vs 5.8%, P < 0.001). LVAD implantation increased over the study period in both age cohorts, whereas OHT increased only in the < 65 group (P < 0.05, all). After multivariable adjustment, patients in the oldest age group were still less likely to receive an LVAD (odds ratio 0.54; confidence interval: 0.43-0.69, P < 0.001) and continued to have the highest odds of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 1.53; confidence interval : 1.39-1.69, P < 0.001). Survival of patients ≥ 65 years requiring ECMO for cardiogenic shock is poor and less commonly includes transition to definitive advanced therapies. Although we must stress that no patient should be denied ECMO based solely on age, we believe our results may be helpful for providers when counseling patients and their families.
