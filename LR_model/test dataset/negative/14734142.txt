Intractable ventricular tachycardia and bridging to heart transplantation with a non-pulsatile flow assist device in a patient with isolated left-ventricular non-compaction. Intractable ventricular tachycardia was investigated in a 51-year-old man with isolated left ventricular non-compaction during implantation of an automated internal cardioverter-defibrillator. Favorable bridging to cardiac transplantation was achieved with the DeBakey left ventricular assist device (LVAD).
