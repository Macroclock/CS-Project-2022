Management of pregnancy in the post-cardiac transplant patient. Over the past 10 years, heart transplantation survival has increased among transplant recipients. Because of improved outcomes in both congenital and adult transplant recipients, the number of male and female patients of childbearing age who desire pregnancy has also increased within this population. While there have been many successful pregnancies in post-cardiac transplant patients reported in the literature, long-term outcome data is limited. Decisions regarding the optimal timing and management of pregnancy in male and female post-cardiac transplant patients are challenging and should be coordinated by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers. Pregnant patients will need to be counseled and monitored carefully for complications including rejection, graft dysfunction, and infection. This review focuses on preconception counseling for both male and female cardiac transplant recipients. The maternal and fetal risks during pregnancy and the postpartum period, including risks to the fetus fathered by a male cardiac transplant recipient will be reviewed. It also provides a brief summary of our own transplant experience and recommendations for overall management of pregnancy in the post-cardiac transplant recipient.  'heart transplant', 'pregnancy'
