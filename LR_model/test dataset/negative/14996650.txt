Is everolimus useful in preventing allograft rejection and vasculopathy after heart transplant? The main cause of illness and death after the first year of heart transplantation is vasculopathy of the cardiac allograft, probably initiated by early immunological and non-immunological endothelial damage. The incidence of multiple episodes of grade 3A rejection 6 months after primary heart transplantation was lower with everolimus (1.5 mg, 8.1% and 3 mg, 6.6%) than in the azathioprine group (14%). Allograft vasculopathy was less frequent with everolimus than azathioprine. A follow-up study is necessary to determine whether these effects translate into the important end points of reduced incidences of death, graft loss or a second transplantation.
