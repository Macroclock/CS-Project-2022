Transplantation from non-heart-beating donors. Non-heart-beating donor (NHBD) transplants have been reintroduced into clinical practice because of the progressively rising number of patients on the transplant waiting list and relatively static numbers of cadaver organ donors. Several units have undertaken NHBD programs utilizing category 3 of Maastricht criteria. The current data show encouraging outcomes, which give rise to further interest in this donor pool. This manuscript briefly summarizes the most recent reports in this field.
