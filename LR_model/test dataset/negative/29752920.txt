Direct Heart Procurement After Donation After Circulatory Death With Ex Situ Reperfusion. The most extended technique of heart procurement from donors after circulatory death involves direct procurement and reperfusion in an ex situ normothermic platform using the Organ Care System (TransMedics, Inc, Andover, MA). This report describes a modified technique (at the Harefield Hospital, London, United Kingdom) with rapid donor blood drainage using a cell-saving device and synchronized perfusion on the Organ Care System.
