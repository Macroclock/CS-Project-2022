Heart transplantation in older candidates. Over the last few years significant changes have occurred in both donor and recipient profiles for heart transplantation (HTX). New therapeutic approaches to chronic heart failure have created a novel class of patients aged between 61 and 70 years. Although they are older than the conventional upper limit, they may undergo HTX using marginal donors. We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of suboptimal donor implants in older recipients to examine negative prognostic factor. Among 272 patients who underwent HTX at our institution from May 1994 to December 2005, 75 (26.5%) were 61 to 72 years (group 1). The remaining 197 (73.5%) denoted as group 2 ranged in age from 18 to 60 years. The Sex distribution, cause of end-stage heart failure, preoperative pulmonary hypertension, pre-HTX clinical status and mean follow-up did not show any significant difference between the two groups. However, group 1 patients had their organs retrieved from marginal donors (89%) vs group 2 (29%; P < .005). They were deceased mainly due to cerebrovascular events, (namely, 82% vs 27%, respectively, P < .005). All analyzed variables-actuarial survival, perioperative mortality, 12-month acute rejection freedom, 100-month chronic rejection freedom, infection freedom, neoplasia freedom, chronic renal failure freedom-did not show any significant difference. Advances in chronic heart failure medical therapy have generated a new class of HTX candidates aged between 61 and 70 years who benefitted from transplantation of organs retrieved from suboptimal donors.
