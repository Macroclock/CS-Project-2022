Indian Transplant Registry-www.transplantindia.com. The Indian Transplant Registry has been made possible due to the efforts of the Indian Society of Organ Transplantation (ISOT) over the past 5 years. The ISOT is about 20 years old and has more than 450 members related to multiorgan transplants with elected officers. It is in its first phase of development and is now available on the Web at www.transplantindia.com. The objective of developing this registry is to be able to view, collate, and audit the national data for all transplants in the country. In the first phase, "fast track" data are being captured with essential details of the program along with the yearly number of transplantations performed, the sex ratio, and type of transplantation. Over 10 major institutions have submitted their data to the registry. In the second phase, over 20 fields would be captured; all member institutions would be encouraged to enter data prospectively. In the third phase, audit of the data would be possible. The members of the ISOT have been supportive and enthusiastic about the registry as reflected in their data submission to date.
