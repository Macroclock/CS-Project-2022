Plasma tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 a predictor of long-term mortality in patients treated with cardiac resynchronization therapy. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) are involved in cardiac remodelling. Available information regarding their prognostic utility in heart failure (HF) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is controversial. The aim of this study was to analyse MMP-2 and TIMP-1 levels as predictors of long-term mortality in HF patients treated with CRT. We prospectively included 42 consecutive patients with successfully implanted CRT. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 and TIMP-1 assays were performed prior to implant. Patients were evaluated at baseline and at the outpatient clinic at 6-month intervals. Clinical response, left ventricular (LV) remodelling, and mortality were analysed. During a mean follow-up of 60 ± 34 months, long-term mortality from any cause was 36% (15 patients). The cause of death was end stage of HF in 12 patients, sudden death in 2 patients, and 1 unknown. After adjustment using a Cox regression model, the independent predictors of long-term mortality were baseline TIMP-1, hazard ratio (HR) 1.18 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) [1.05-1.33], P = 0.007), baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR), HR 0.97 (95% CI [0.94-1.00], P = 0.05), and permanent atrial fibrillation (AF), HR 3.14 (95% CI [1.02-9.67], P = 0.04). Area under receiver operating characteristic curve for TIMP-1 was 0.79 (95% CI [0.63-0.94]). Tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 ≥ 248 ng/mL predicts mortality with 80% sensitivity and 71% specificity. Tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 is a powerful predictor of long-term mortality in HF patients treated with CRT.
