Clinical course and outcome after treatment with ventricular assist devices in paediatric patients: A single-centre experience. Heart failure is a rare condition in the paediatric population, associated with high morbidity and mortality. When medical therapy is no longer sufficient, mechanical circulatory support such as a ventricular assist device can be used to bridge these children to transplant or recovery. Coagulation-related complications such as thrombi, embolism and bleeding events represent the greatest challenge in paediatric patients on mechanical support. We aimed to describe the outcomes and coagulation-related complications in this patient population at our institution. A total of 20 patients with either Berlin Heart EXCOR® or HeartWare® implantation were reviewed in this retrospective study. Study endpoints were survival to heart transplant, weaning due to recovery or death. Thrombotic events were defined as thrombus formation in the device or in the patient, or cardioembolic strokes. Bleeding events were defined as events requiring interventional surgery or transfusion of red blood cells. The aetiology of heart failure included cardiomyopathy (n = 12), end-stage congenital heart disease (n = 6) and myocarditis (n = 2). Of the 20 patients, 12 were bridged to transplant, 7 recovered and could be weaned and 1 died. The median duration of mechanical support was 84 days (range: 20-524 days). At least one major or minor bleeding event occurred in 45% of the patients. Thrombotic events occurred 21 times in 10 patients. Four of the patients (20%) had no bleeding or thromboembolic event. In all, 95% of the patients were successfully bridged to transplant or recovery. Bleeding events and thrombotic events were common. 'coagulation', 'paediatric', 'ventricular assist devices'
