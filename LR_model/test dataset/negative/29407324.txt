Expression Pattern of Tumor Necrosis Factor-α-Induced Protein 8-Like 2 in Acute Rejection of Cardiac Allograft. Tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein-8 like-2 (TIPE2) is a negative regulator of innate immunity and cellular immunity, yet the expression pattern of TIPE2 in acute rejection of cardiac allograft remain enigmatic. We developed cardiac transplantation models and divided into 3 groups: a naive group, a syngeneic group, and an allogeneic group. Then, we detected the messenger RNA and protein of TIPE2 in cardiac allografts. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed expression of CD4 and CD8 in the donor heart, and immunofluorescence assay revealed the association between T cells and TIPE2. In our study, we first found that the expression of TIPE2 in cardiac allografts is upregulated compared with the syngeneic control, and increases in a time-dependent manner. The immunocytochemistry of heart grafts revealed a strong expression of TIPE2 in the inflammatory cells, but not in the cardiomyocytes. Finally, we proved that CD4 The upregulated expression of TIPE2 in cardiac allografts, mainly came from T cells, which infiltrated the donor heart. This finding indicates that there may be an association between TIPE2 and acute cardiac allograft rejection.
