Family functioning in pediatric heart transplantation: Variables associated with poor outcomes. Family functioning is integral in a child's life and is linked to quality of life in health as well as disease. This has been scarcely studied in pediatric orthotopic heart transplantation (pOHT). In this study, we evaluate demographic and clinical factors associated with family functioning in this patient population. Pediatric post-transplant families were recruited in an outpatient setting (n = 71). The PedsQL Family Impact Module was administered, along with the Parent and Adolescent Medication Barriers Scales (PMBS; AMBS) and the McArthur socioeconomic scale. Associations between clinical and demographic variables and scaled scores were evaluated. In our sample, patients with congenital heart disease, developmental delay, and enteral feeding had lower total impact (P = .026; P = .011; P = .008) and parent self-reported HRQL scores (P = .018; P = .012; P = .005). Patients with developmental delay and enteral feeding also had lower family functioning summary scores (P = .025; P = .031). Higher parent educational status was associated with lower total impact scores (P = .043). Higher PMBS scores demonstrated negative correlation with total impact (P < .001), parent self-reported HRQL (P < .001), and family functioning summary scores (P = .003). Multiple linear regression analysis identified developmental delay, parental education, and PMBS as independent variables associated with family functioning. Our study highlights important factors impacting family functioning in pOHT. Developmental delay, higher parental education, and PMBS were associated with poorer family functioning. Our findings emphasize the need for a multi-disciplinary approach including serial psychological assessment and interventions in the management of pOHT patients in order to optimize family functioning.
