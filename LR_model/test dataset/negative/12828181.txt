[Rat heart transplantation immune tolerance induced by blockade of B7-CD28 interaction]. To study immune tolerance induced by blockade of B7-CD28 interaction after heart transplantation in rats. A model of rat heterotopic heart allograft was established by using Ono's technique. CTLA-4-Ig was administered by intraperitoneal injection at dose of 100 micro. Survival times, histological changes, and the concentration of IL-2, IgG and IgM were measured after operation. Survival times were 31.60 +/- 1.82 days in experimental group and vs 7.25 +/- 0.71 days in control groups. In the experimental group, the graft survival time prolonged significantly (P < 0.01). Histological changes were characterized by mild scattered mononuclear infiltration and patchy myocyte injury in the experimental group (grade I - II). In the control group, the changes were characterized by severe lymphocyte infiltration, myocyte injury and necrosis, interstitial edema, and hemorrhage (grade IV). IL-2 was significantly decreased after operation (P < 0.01). IgG and IgM were not changed significantly in comparison with those in the control group (P > 0.05). The blockade B7-CD28 interaction can induce rat heterotopic heart allograft immune tolerance. It may provide a new way to treat immune rejection after transplantation.
