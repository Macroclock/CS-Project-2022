Liver Allograft Provides Immunoprotection for the Cardiac Allograft in Combined Heart-Liver Transplantation. When transplanted simultaneously, the liver allograft has been thought to have an immunoprotective role on other organs; however, detailed analyses in simultaneous heart-liver transplantation (SHLT) have not been done to date. We analyzed patient outcomes and incidence of immune-mediated injury in 22 consecutive SHLT versus 223 isolated heart transplantation (IHT) recipients between January 2004 and December 2013, by reviewing 3912 protocol- and indication-specific cardiac allograft biopsy specimens. Overall survival was similar (86.4%, 86.4%, and 69.1% for SHLT and 93.3%, 84.7%, and 70.0% for IHT at 1, 5, and 10 years; p = 0.83). Despite similar immunosuppression, the incidence of T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) was lower in SHLT (31.8%) than in IHT (84.8%) (p < 0.0001). Although more SHLT patients had preexisting donor-specific HLA antibody (22.7% versus 8.1%; p = 0.04), the incidence of antibody-mediated rejection was not different in SHLT compared with IHT (4.5% versus 14.8%, p = 0.33). While the left ventricular ejection fraction was comparable in both groups at 5 years, the incidence and severity of cardiac allograft vasculopathy were reduced in the SHLT recipients (42.9% versus 66.8%, p = 0.03). Simultaneously transplanted liver allograft was associated with reduced risk of TCMR (odds ratio [OR] 0.003, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0-0.02; p < 0.0001), antibody-mediated rejection (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0-0.46; p = 0.004), and cardiac allograft vasculopathy (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.07-0.84; p = 0.02), after adjusting for other risk factors. These data suggest that the incidence of alloimmune injury in the heart allograft is reduced in SHLT recipients.
