Vascular adhesion protein-1, a novel molecule, in kidney and heart allograft recipients. VAP-1 (vascular adhesion protein-1) is a copper-containing SSAO (semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase) secreted by vascular smooth muscle cells, adipocytes, and endothelial cells. Elevation of SSAO activity is observed in atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. The aim of the study was to assess VAP-1 in prevalent heart and kidney allograft recipients. Complete blood count, urea, serum lipids, fasting glucose, and creatinine were studied by standard laboratory methods. VAP-1, N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were estimated using commercially available assays. Healthy volunteers showed higher hemoglobin and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) but lower creatinine, NT-proBNP, hsCRP and VAP-1 relative to heart and kidney transplantation (OHT) (KTx). Among heart transplant recipients, VAP-1 correlated with age, presence of diabetes, insulin therapy, ejection fraction, estimated glomerular filtration rate by MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease), eGFR by CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiological Collaboration), use of tacrolimus, LVIDd (left ventricular internal end-diastolic dimension), New York Heart Association class and NT-proBNP. VAP-1 was significantly lower among patients treated with tacrolimus than cyclosporine. Diabetic patients versus nondiabetic subjects as well as patients with eGFR below 60 versus â‰¥ 60 mL/min showed higher serum VAP-1 in OHT and KTx populations. Multiple regression analysis revealed VAP-1 to be predicted in 25% by LVIDd, and use of tacrolimus in OHT. In kidney transplant recipients, VAP-1 correlated only with time after transplantation and serum glucose. CONCLUDING: VAP-1 elevations in heart transplant recipients were predominantly dependent on left ventricular diameter and use of tacrolimus; however, the precise associations with the immunosuppressive regimen warrant further studies. VAP-1 elevations in kidney transplant recipients may relate to glucose control.
