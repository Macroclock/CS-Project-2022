Cold ischaemic time and time after transplantation alter segmental myocardial velocities after heart transplantation. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in segmental, three-directional left ventricular (LV) velocities in patients after heart transplantation (Tx). Magnetic resonance tissue phase mapping was used to assess myocardial velocities in patients after Tx (n = 27) with normal LV ejection fraction (63 ± 5%) and those without signs of rejection. Regional wall motion and dyssynchrony were analysed in relation to cold ischaemic time (150 ± 57 min, median = 154 min), age of the donor heart (35 ± 13 years, median = 29 years), time after transplantation (32 ± 26 months, median = 31 months) and global LV morphology and function. Segmental myocardial velocities were significantly altered in patients with cold ischaemic times >155 min resulting in an increase in peak systolic radial velocities (2 of 16 segments, P = 0.03-0.04) and reduced segmental diastolic long-axis velocities (5 of 16 segments, P = 0.01-0.04). Time after transplantation (n = 8 patients <12 months after Tx vs n = 19 >12 months) had a significant influence on systolic radial velocities (increased in 2 of 16 segments, P = 0.01-0.04) and diastolic long-axis velocities (reduced in 5 of 16 segments, P = 0.02-0.04). Correlation analysis and multiple regression revealed significant relationships of cold ischaemic time (R = -0.384, P = 0.048), the donor heart's age (β= 0.9, P = 0.01) and time from transplantation (β= -0.36, P = 0.03) with long-axis diastolic dyssynchrony. Time after transplantation and cold ischaemic time strongly affect segmental systolic and diastolic motion in patients after Tx. The understanding of alterations in regional LV motion in the transplanted heart under stable conditions is essential in order to utilize this methodology in the future as a potentially non-invasive means of diagnosing transplant rejection.
