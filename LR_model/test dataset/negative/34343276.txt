Cardiac allograft vasculopathy: current review and future research directions. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a pathologic immune-mediated remodelling of the vasculature in transplanted hearts and, by impairing perfusion, is the major cause of late graft loss. Although best understood following cardiac transplantation, similar forms of allograft vasculopathy occur in other vascularized organ grafts and some features of CAV may be shared with other immune-mediated vasculopathies. Here, we describe the incidence and diagnosis, the nature of the vascular remodelling, immune and non-immune contributions to pathogenesis, current therapies, and future areas of research in CAV.
