Long-Term Sirolimus for Primary Immunosuppression in Heart Transplant Recipients. Small studies have reported superiority of sirolimus (SRL) over calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) in mitigating cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) after heart transplantation (HT). However, data on the long-term effect on CAV progression and clinical outcomes are lacking. The aim of this study was to test the long-term safety and efficacy of conversion from CNI to SRL as maintenance therapy on CAV progression and outcomes after HT. A cohort of 402 patients who underwent HT and were either treated with CNI alone (n = 134) or converted from CNI to SRL (n = 268) as primary immunosuppression was analyzed. CAV progression was assessed using serial coronary intravascular ultrasound during treatment with CNI (n = 99) and after conversion to SRL (n = 235) in patients who underwent at least 2 intravascular ultrasound studies. The progression in plaque volume (2.8 ± 2.3 mm Early conversion to SRL is associated with attenuated CAV progression and with lower long-term mortality and fewer CAV-related events compared with continued CNI use.
