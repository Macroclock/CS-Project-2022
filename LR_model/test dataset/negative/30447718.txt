Role of Advanced Testing: Invasive Hemodynamics, Endomyocardial Biopsy, and Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy affects 0.5% of the population. Advanced testing is considered, including cardiac catheterization, endomyocardial biopsy, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Right and left heart catheterization provides essential hemodynamic data, identifies patients who might benefit from septal reduction therapy, and assesses for comorbidities. Pathologic analysis reveals ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial disarray, and endocardial and interstitial fibrosis. Routine endomyocardial biopsy is not recommended unless other conditions that cause hypertrophy need to be ruled out. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing provides useful physiologic data, allows monitoring of the response to medication and surgical interventions, estimates prognosis, and guides referral for orthotopic heart transplantation.
