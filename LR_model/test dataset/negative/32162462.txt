Brain-dead donor heart conservation with a preservation solution supplemented by a conditioned medium from mesenchymal stem cells improves graft contractility after transplantation. Hearts are usually procured from brain-dead (BD) donors. However, brain death may induce hemodynamic instability, which may contribute to posttransplant graft dysfunction. We hypothesized that BD-donor heart preservation with a conditioned medium (CM) from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) would improve graft function after transplantation. Additionally, we explored the PI3K pathway's potential role. Rat MSCs-derived CM was used for conservation purposes. Donor rats were either exposed to sham operation or brain death by inflation of a subdural balloon-catheter for 5.5 hours. Then, the hearts were explanted, stored in cardioplegic solution-supplemented with either a medium vehicle (BD and sham), CM (BD + CM), or LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K (BD + CM + LY), and finally transplanted. Systolic performance and relaxation parameters were significantly reduced in BD-donors compared to sham. After transplantation, systolic and diastolic functions were significantly decreased, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells and endonuclease G positive cells were increased in the BD-group compared to sham. Preservation of BD-donor hearts with CM resulted in a recovery of systolic graft function (dP/dt 'animal models', 'basic (laboratory) research/science', 'donors and donation: donation after brain death (DBD)', 'heart transplantation/cardiology', 'ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI)', 'signaling/signaling pathways: PI-3 kinase/ Akt pathway'
