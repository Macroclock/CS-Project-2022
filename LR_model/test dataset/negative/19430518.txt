[Global evaluation of the heart in heart transplant recipients using dual-source computed tomography]. In routine clinical practice surveillance of heart transplant recipients is usually performed using echocardiography and conventional coronary angiography. The latter permits diagnosis and follow-up of coronary allograft vasculopathy. However, this procedure is invasive and is not free of complications. Conventional multislice computed tomography (MSCT) has been shown to be a useful non-invasive tool for ruling out coronary artery disease and evaluating cardiac function. However, due to its limited temporal resolution betablocker administration is required, and its usefulness in certain patient populations with restricted response to this medication, such as heart transplant recipients, may therefore be limited. Dual-source CT (DSCT) allows evaluation of the coronary arteries in all individuals independent of their heart rate. In the case presented here, we demonstrate that DSCT may be useful for evaluating cardiac function and ruling out coronary allograft vasculopathy in heart transplant recipients.
