Cardiac reinnervation affects cardiorespiratory adaptations to exercise training in individuals with heart transplantation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the hemodynamic and cardiorespiratory adaptations to exercise in individuals with heart transplantation with evidence of cardiac reinnervation (cardiac reinnervation group) versus without evidence of cardiac reinnervation (no cardiac reinnervation group). Sedentary individuals with heart transplantation (age = 45.5 ± 2.2 years; time elapsed since surgery = 6.7 ± 0.7 years) were divided into the cardiac reinnervation ( The cardiac reinnervation group had reduced ( There were greater improvements in ambulatory blood pressure and maximal oxygen consumption in the cardiac reinnervation than the no cardiac reinnervation group. These results suggest that cardiac reinnervation associates with hemodynamic and cardiorespiratory adaptations to exercise training in individuals with heart transplantation.
