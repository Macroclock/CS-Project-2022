Can the Nerve Growth Factor promote the reinnervation of the transplanted heart? The activity of the heart is widely regulated by the autonomous nervous system. This important mechanism of control may be impaired in chronic diseases such as heart failure or lost in those patients who undergo heart transplantation, owing to the surgical interruption of cardiac nerves in the transplanted heart. It has been demonstrated that spontaneous reinnervation can occur in transplanted hearts and is associated with an improvement in cardiac function. However, this process may require many years and the restoration of a proper cardiac innervation and functioning during exercise is never complete. In this perspective, the Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and other neurotrophic hormones might ameliorate cardiac innervation in the transplanted heart and should be tried in animal models. Endothelial cells engineered with a viral vector to overexpress the NGF might be engrafted in the heart and integrate into cardiac small vessels, thus providing a source of neurotrophic factors which might promote and direct regrowth and axonal sprouting of cardiac nerves.
