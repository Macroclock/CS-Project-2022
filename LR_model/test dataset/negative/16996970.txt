Left atrial sarcoma: resection and repair by cardiac autotransplant and in situ pericardial patch. This report demonstrates the method of resection of a left atrial tumor involving the right superior pulmonary vein. The unique features are use of adjacent pericardium as an in situ patch to reconstruct the left atrium when there is no margin of left atrium remaining on the pulmonary veins and cardiac autotransplantation.
