Arrhythmias after orthotopic heart transplantation. Arrhythmias frequently occur after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). The most common are ventricular premature complexes, atrial premature complexes, sinus or junctional bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter, all of which have varying clinical significance depending on associated or causative conditions. Unique etiologic factors such as allograft rejection, transplant coronary artery disease, and altered anatomy and autonomic nervous system changes require that arrhythmias be treated differently after OHT compared with the general population. The potentially severe ramifications of allograft rejection and coronary artery disease make treatment of these disorders in the setting of arrhythmias as important as treating the arrhythmias themselves. At the same time, autonomic denervation and altered anatomy after transplantation complicate drug and device therapies.
