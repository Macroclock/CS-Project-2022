Native BK viral nephropathy in a pediatric heart transplant recipient. BK viral nephropathy is a well-documented clinical entity in kidney transplant recipients and a significant cause of morbidity and allograft loss in affected patients. BK viral nephropathy in native kidneys of non-kidney transplant recipients is relatively uncommon, but has been reported in adult patients. We report the occurrence of BK viral nephropathy in a pediatric heart transplant recipient. A 10-yr-old boy with past history of Ewing's sarcoma underwent heart transplantation for dilated cardiomyopathy induced by previous chemotherapy with doxorubicin. Post-transplant course was complicated by grade 3A rejection and CMV colitis. He was diagnosed with native BK viral nephropathy approximately 18 months post-transplant due to mild, but persistent, elevation in serum creatinine associated with proteinuria. BK viral nephropathy affects non-kidney transplant recipients, and a high index of suspicion is necessary for early diagnosis and management of this condition.
