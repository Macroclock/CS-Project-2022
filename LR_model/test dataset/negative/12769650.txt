Pharmacotherapeutic approach to prevent or treat chronic allograft nephropathy. In the current paper we will review the evidence that drug therapy may be of value to prevent or treat chronic allograft nephropathy. We will review the immunosuppressive therapy and non-immune therapies in use to treat risk factors associated with chronic allograft nephropathy and evaluate their efficacy with respect to long term outcome as well as their effect on markers of long-term survival. In the last part of this review, we will indicate possible benefits of new approaches being explored but most of these data are obtained in in vitro test systems and rodent models.
