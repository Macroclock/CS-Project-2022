Switzerland is small in size but big on cardiology. Switzerland is a small country in the heart of Europe and well known worldwide for its Alps, foreign bank accounts, cheese, chocolate and watches. However, it also has made a significant contribution to cardiology, especially interventional cardiology. It was where balloon angioplasty and stenting of obstructed coronary arteries, two of the most stunning advances in cardiology in the last 30 years and the two most frequently performed interventional procedures in cardiology, originated. The author, who recently served as a visiting professor in the University of Geneva, University of Bern and University of Zurich, summarized his personal observations and impressions in this report.
