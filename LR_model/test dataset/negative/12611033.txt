[Geographic variations in access to heart transplantation in France]. This study was undertaken to determine whether there were regional variations in the access to the national waiting list for cardiac transplantation and in access to cardiac transplantation itself in France. The incidence of inscription on the waiting list for transplantation was calculated for new candidates living in each region between 1998 and 2000, indicating the level of access to the waiting list. The average interval before transplantation between 1995 and 2000 was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The regional lack of transplant organs was estimated by the ratio of the difference between patients inscribed on the waiting list and those operated, over the number of patients operated. The overall national incidence of inscription of the waiting list for cardiac transplantation was 8 new patients per year per million inhabitants with a range of 1.7 in Corsica to 12.1 in Lorraine. The regional incidence was lower than the national reference in 5 regions in higher in 4 regions. There was a strong attraction of patients to the Ile-de-France, Pays de la Loire and Rhone-Alpes regions. The average waiting time for transplantation in France was 3.7 months and ranged from 1.2 months in Brittany to 15.4 months in Aquitaine (p < 0.001). The degree of regional lack of transplant organs was significantly and positively correlated with the average waiting time for transplantation. The results of this study show that there are regional differences in the incidence of inscription on the waiting list for cardiac transplantation in France and a significant variation in waiting times for cardiac transplantation, and therefore, in access to cardiac transplantation.
