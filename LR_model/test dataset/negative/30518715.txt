Natriuretic Peptide Processing in Patients with and Without Left Ventricular Dysfunction. This study aimed to examine the relationship between corin expression and circulating brain natriuretic peptide in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.Circulating levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) can be an indicator of LV dysfunction. The 32-amino-acid BNP is cleaved by corin, a cardiac serine protease, from its108-amino-acid pro-brain natriuretic peptide (proBNP) precursor.This study included 25 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP) and LV dysfunction and 44 heart transplant recipients with normal LV function who underwent diagnostic left and right heart catheterization. Blood samples were used to determine the ratio of plasma proBNP/BNP levels, and LV endomyocardial biopsies were used to determine the expression of NPPB, which encode BNP and corin, respectively, by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.Patients with DCMP revealed worse hemodynamic profiles and higher plasma proBNP and BNP levels than those of the transplant recipients. Myocardial NPPB expression was higher and CORIN expression was lower in the DCMP patients than in the transplant recipients. CORIN expression significantly correlated with NPPB expression (r = -0.585; P < 0.001), ejection fraction (EF; r = 0.694; P < 0.01), LV end-diastolic pressure (r = -0.373; P < 0.05), and indexed end-diastolic LV volume (r = -0.452; P < 0.001). In addition, the plasma proBNP/BNP levels inversely correlated with the CORIN expression (r = -0.362; P < 0.005).Decreased myocardial CORIN expression and the corresponding higher levels of circulating unprocessed proBNP in DCMP may partly account for the relative BNP resistance observed in patients with LV dysfunction.
