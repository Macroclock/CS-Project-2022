Short-course total lymphoid irradiation for refractory cardiac transplantation rejection. Total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) has been used as an effective therapy for refractory allograft cardiac transplantation rejection. In this study we assessed our short-course TLI regimen for treatment of this condition. A short course of TLI (4.5 Gy in 4 fractions) was given to 6 patients with recalcitrant allograft cardiac transplant rejection at the Royal Perth Hospital. Treatment compliance was excellent with most patients having no acute toxicity. With a median follow-up of 25 months, 83% of patients remain alive and disease-free. To date, no convincing evidence of radiation-related late effects have been documented with TLI. Nonetheless, larger scale trials are required for validation before this approach can be widely incorporated into the current transplantation (Tx) rejection regimen.
