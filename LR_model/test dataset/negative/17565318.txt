Spontaneous allograft tolerance in B7-deficient mice independent of preexisting endogenous CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cells. Acute cardiac allograft rejection requires host, but not donor, expression of B7-1/B7-2 costimulatory molecules. However, acute cardiac rejection requires direct antigen presentation by donor-derived antigen presenting cells to CD4 T-cells and does not require indirect antigen presentation to CD4 T-cells. Given this discrepancy in the literature and that the consequence of allograft exposure in B7-deficient mice is unknown; the goal of the study was to examine the antidonor status of allografted B7-1/B7-2-deficient hosts. C57Bl/6 B7-1/B7-2-/- mice were grafted with heterotopic BALB/c hearts. Recipients bearing long-term surviving allografts were used to examine the status of antidonor reactivity in vitro and in vivo. Tolerance was examined in vivo through adoptive transfer of splenocytes from graft-bearing animals to secondary immune-deficient Rag-1-/- hosts bearing donor-type or third-party cardiac allografts and by regulatory T-cell depletion with anti-CD25 antibody. When transferred to B7-replete Rag-1-/- recipients, cells from na√Øve B7-1/B7-2-/- mice readily initiated cardiac allograft rejection. However, splenocytes transferred from long-term allograft acceptor B7-1/B7-2-/- hosts failed to reject donor-type hearts but acutely rejected third-party allografts. In addition, such cells did not reject (donorxthird-party) F1 allografts. Finally, in vivo depletion of regulatory T-cells did not prevent long-term acceptance. Results demonstrate that B7-deficient T-cells are capable of acute cardiac allograft rejection in a B7-replete environment. Importantly, results also show that B7-deficient hosts do not simply ignore cardiac allografts, but rather spontaneously develop transferable, donor-specific tolerance and linked suppression in vivo. Interestingly, this tolerant state does not require endogenous CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cells.
