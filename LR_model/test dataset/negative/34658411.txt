A Novel Method to Safely De-Air a HeartWare System in a Single-Ventricle Patient by Utilizing ECMO and a Minimized CPB Circuit. The survival of congenital heart disease (CHD) patients with single-ventricle (SV) physiology has markedly increased as a result of advances in operative techniques and postsurgical management. Nonetheless, these patients remain highly susceptible to end-stage heart failure requiring cardiac replacement therapies at early ages. Given a worldwide shortage of transplantable organs, mechanical circulatory support (MCS) represents an alternative treatment option. The significant heterogeneity of the SV population presents unique indications for MCS that have begun to be evaluated. This case study describes a 12-year-old female with heterotaxy syndrome and an SV condition, previously palliated with a Fontan operation at another institution. The patient was placed on veno-arterial (VA) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and later underwent HeartWare ventricular assist device (HVAD) implantation as a bridge to transplantation (BTT). A novel method was chosen to optimize careful de-airing of the heart through a minimized cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) setup, during full ECMO support and surgical insertion of the HeartWare. The ascending aorta was vented proximal to the HVAD outflow graft anastomosis through a minimized CPB circuit at <10% of the ECMO flow rate. This circuit adaption allowed for euvolemic resuscitation via connection from the minimized CPB circuit to the venous limb of the ECMO circuit. The transition from VA-ECMO to the HeartWare was well tolerated despite a challenging sternotomy and cardiac anomaly. A minimized bypass circuit proved efficacious for the benefit of volume resuscitation and safe de-airing of the HVAD while on ECMO support. The literature is limited concerning safe practices for implantation of durable VADs in complex SV patients coupled with those transitioning from varying modalities of MCS. As SV survivability regresses to heart failure, it is essential that we share techniques that aim to improve the long-term outcomes for successful BTT or bridge to decision (BTD).
