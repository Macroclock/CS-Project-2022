Cardiac amyloidosis: the importance of a multidisciplinary approach. Cardiac amyloidosis is associated with the interstitial deposition of abnormal protein in the myocardium, which can lead to a form of restrictive cardiomyopathy with a poor prognosis. This protein can have a number of different origins, which give rise to various subtypes of amyloidosis that have different prognoses and that require different therapeutic approaches. Drugs commonly used in heart failure have little effect in amyloidosis and the use of heart transplantation is controversial because amyloidosis is a multi-organ disease and because there is a possibility of disease recurrence in the graft. The use of new techniques to identify the specific amyloidosis subtype, the emergence of novel ways of preventing or decreasing amyloid production, the ability to monitor responses to therapy and, above all, the introduction of multidisciplinary teams that can implement a combination of therapies, including multiple organ transplantation, have contributed to a substantial improvement in the prognosis of this disease.
