Acquired epidermodysplasia verruciformis (AEV) in three children after cardiac transplantation: A case series and review of the literature. Acquired epidermodysplasia verruciformis (AEV) describes epidermodysplasia verruciformis developing in an immunocompromised host. There is limited information in the literature regarding AEV in the pediatric population; of the patients reported, most patients described had HIV, with only two reported cases of children who developed AEV post-transplantation. This case series describes three pediatric patients who developed AEV on immunosuppressant therapy following cardiac transplantation. We review risk factors, treatment options, and prognosis of AEV in the pediatric population. 'childhood EV', 'immunocompromised', 'post-transplant AEV'
