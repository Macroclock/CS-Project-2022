The role of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in patients with continuous flow left ventricular assist devices. The prognosis for patients experiencing ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) while on continuous flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support has not been well elucidated. Accordingly, the role of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in this patient population remains undefined. Records of 106 consecutive patients undergoing implantation of the HeartMate II LVAD at a single center were reviewed. For patients surviving >30 days postimplant (98 patients), the impact of VAs and ICDs on survival was analyzed. Mean age was 56.6Â±11.4 years, 82.1% were male, 42.5% had an ischemic cardiomyopathy, 87.7% were bridge to transplantation, and median length of support was 217 days. Twenty-one (19.8%) patients died, 60 (56.6%) survived to transplantation, and 25 patients (23.6%) reached the end of study, had the LVAD explanted, or were lost to follow-up. Post-LVAD VAs occurred in 37 patients (34.9%) but were not associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 0.58 [0.18-1.90]). Sixty-two (63.3%) patients had an active ICD, and 36 (36.7%) patients had no ICD or an inactivated ICD post-LVAD. Patients with an ICD were more likely to be INTERMACS (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) level 3 or 4 at the time of implant (54.8% versus 33.3%; P=0.04). An appropriate shock was delivered in 27.3% of patients, but the presence of an active ICD was not associated with improved survival (hazard ratio, 1.12 [0.37-3.35]). VAs are common in patients with continuous flow LVADs. Although some episodes may be clinically significant, VAs are not associated with a worse prognosis, and concomitant ICDs in these patients may not reduce mortality.
