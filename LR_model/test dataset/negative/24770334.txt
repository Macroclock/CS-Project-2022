Fate of atrioventricular valve function of the transplanted heart. Long-term echocardiographic data on quantitative assessment of tricuspid and mitral regurgitation after heart transplantation are scarce. From November 1992 to December 2008, the medical records for 201 patients (mean age, 42.8±12.4 years, 47 females) who underwent heart transplantation were reviewed. Quantitative assessment of mitral and tricuspid valve function was performed using transthoracic echocardiography through long-term follow-up. A total of 196 (97.5%) patients were evaluated with echocardiography for more than 6 months postoperatively. During a mean echocardiography follow-up duration of 89.9±54.3 months, 23 (11.4%) patients showed either tricuspid regurgitation (TR >mild; n=21, 10.4%) or mitral regurgitation (MR >mild; n=6, 3.0%); 4 (2.0%) patients experienced both significant TR and MR. Freedom from moderate-to-severe TR at 10 years was 85.5±5.1% and 93.4±2.2% for the standard and bicaval techniques, respectively (P=0.531). Freedom from moderate-to-severe MR at 10 years was 96.0±2.7% and 98.6±1.0%, respectively, for the 2 techniques (P=0.252). In multivariate analysis, older-age donor emerged as the only independent predictor of significant TR (hazard ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.12, P=0.012). The long-term results of atrioventricular function after heart transplantation in adults were excellent regardless of anastomotic technique. Older-age donor was significantly associated with the development of postoperative TR.
