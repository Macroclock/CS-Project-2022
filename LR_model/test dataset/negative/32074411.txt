Sacubitril/valsartan in patients listed for heart transplantation: effect on physical frailty. The aim of this study was to investigate prospectively the effect of sacubitril/valsartan in advanced heart failure (HF) patients in waiting list for heart transplantation (HT) and the effect on physical frailty (PF). We treated 37 consecutive patients with advanced HF with sacubitril/valsartan. Patients were followed up until HT, device implant, or last follow-up visit after 2 years of follow-up. At baseline, mean New York Heart Association (NYHA) class was 3.1 ± 0.4, with 64.9% in NYHA III and 35.1% NYHA IIIB. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 23.5 ± 5.8%, VO Our study showed a rapid improvement in PF in HT waiting list patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan. The improvement in all PF domains was paralleled by VO 'Frailty', 'Heart Failure', 'Sacubitril/Valsartan'
