Acute heart failure--intra-aortic balloon: a forgotten treatment. Acute heart failure (AHF) is a serious clinical condition associated with high morbidity and mortality. The authors present the case of a 61-year-old man, with a past history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with heart failure, who came to the emergency room due to acute decompensation. During hospital stay he developed cardiogenic shock and inotropic support was initiated, followed by mechanical circulatory assistance with intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, as a bridge to heart transplantation. The authors discuss theoretical considerations concerning subtypes and etiology of AHF, and indications for the use of mechanical support and heart transplantation.
