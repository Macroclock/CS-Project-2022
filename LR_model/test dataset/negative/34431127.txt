Outflow cannula position for left ventricular assist device: A propensity score-matched study. The clinical consequences of alternative outflow cannula positioning in patients undergoing left ventricular assist device implantation are unknown. We evaluated clinical outcomes in patients who underwent implantation with the outflow cannula implanted from the right side into the ascending aorta versus the left side of the pericardium. Fifty consecutive patients with terminal left heart failure underwent implantation using the Medtronic Heartware Ventricular Assist Device at Toronto General Hospital. Patients were divided between left and right outflow cannula positioning during implantation where anastomosis occurred in the ascending aorta. Propensity score matching using exact matching on the following pre-specified covariates: Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support score, previous cardiac surgery, and preoperative inotrope use. Fifty consecutive patients (25 left implantation and 25 right implantation) were included in the unmatched cohort and 45 patients (25 left implantation and 20 right implantation) were included in the matched cohort. No significant differences in baseline demographics. Pump thrombosis occurred in 10% (n = 2) receiving right-sided implantation and 8% (n = 2) with left implantation (p = 1.00). Postoperative stroke occurred in 10% (2/20) with right implantation and 16% (4/25) with left implantation (p = .88). No difference in 1-year mortality between right 20% (5/25) and left 25% (5/20) implantation (p = .97). No observed difference in mortality when adjusting for competing risk of heart transplantation. There was also no difference in stroke, pump thrombosis, driveline infection. Larger studies are required to confirm these findings. These preliminary data support the use of left-sided anastomoses to facilitate subsequent re-entry during heart transplantation.
