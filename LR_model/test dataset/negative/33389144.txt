Functional evidence of low-pressure cardiopulmonary baroreceptor reinnervation 1 year after heart transplantation. Heart transplantation (HTx) implies denervation of afferent neural connections. Reinnervation of low-pressure cardiopulmonary baroreceptors might impact the development and treatment of hypertension, but little is known of its occurrence. The present prospective study investigated possible afferent reinnervation of low-pressure cardiopulmonary baroreceptors during the first year after heart transplantation. A total of 50 heart transplant recipients (HTxRs) were included and were evaluated 7-12 weeks after transplant surgery, with follow-up 6 and 12 months later. In addition, a reference group of 50 healthy control subjects was examined once. Continuous, non-invasive recordings of cardiovascular variables were carried out at supine rest, during 15 min of 20° head-up tilt, during Valsalva maneuver and during 1 min of 30% maximal voluntary handgrip. In addition, routine clinical data including invasive measurements were used in the analyses. During the first year after HTx, the heart rate (HR) response to 20° head-up tilt partly normalized, a negative relationship between resting mean right atrial pressure and HR tilt response developed, low-frequency variability of the RR interval and systolic blood pressure at supine rest increased, and the total peripheral resistance response to Valsalva maneuver became stronger. Functional assessments suggest that afferent reinnervation of low-pressure cardiopulmonary receptors occurs during the first year after heart transplantation, partially restoring reflex-mediated responses to altered cardiac filling.
