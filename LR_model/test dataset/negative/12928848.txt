Pancreatitis following heart transplantation: report of a case. Serious complications involving the alimentary tract following cardiac transplantations are commonly reported, and may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. One of the most serious gastrointestinal complications in such patients is acute pancreatitis. There is still little known concerning its pathogenesis, early diagnosis, and the most appropriate treatment for this clinical condition. Many authors have reported a high mortality caused by difficulties in making an accurate diagnosis resulting in the use of inappropriate therapy for so called crypto-symptomatic acute pancreatitis. The factor suspected to be responsible for the increased frequency of the gastroenterological diseases and for their masked onset seems to be immunosuppression, especially by corticosteroids. The case of a 46-year-old male patient with cardiac transplant, who, 3 years after the transplantation, developed mild acute pancreatitis, is presented. The immunosuppressive regimen he followed was based on cyclosporine. The acute pancreatitis was treated conservatively with a satisfactory outcome. In the course of the illness the patient developed a pancreatic pseudocyst that was managed successfully by percutaneous drainage. The patient is currently being followed up, and both his medical ailments and health-related quality of life are being monitored, while he continues to show mild symptoms of chronic pancreatitis.
