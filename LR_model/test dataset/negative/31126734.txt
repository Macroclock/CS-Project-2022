Right ventricular systolic to diastolic duration ratio: A novel predictor of outcome in adult idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. The systolic to diastolic (SD) duration ratio reflects global RV performance in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) yet limited data exists on its application to adult non-congenital PAH. We measured SD ratios on echocardiogram in idiopathic PAH (IPAH) to establish its response to pulmonary vasodilator therapy and prognostic value at diagnosis and follow up. Incident patients with IPAH undergoing echocardiogram, haemodynamic and exercise assessments were identified within our centre between 2005 and 2018. SD ratios were adjusted for heart rate at diagnosis and follow up. In 98 patients at diagnosis, the mean SD ratio was 1.03 ± 0.37 decreasing to 0.85 ± 0.25, p < 0.001 at follow-up echocardiogram performed at a median interval of 9.0 months. The SD ratio at diagnosis correlated weakly with RV basal diameter (r = 0.24, p = 0.04) and 6MWD (r = 0.23, p = 0.04). At follow up, the mean SD ratio was lower in those receiving combination vs monotherapy pulmonary vasodilator treatment (71 ± 25 vs 92 ± 22% baseline respectively, p < 0.001). After a median follow-up of 4.8 years, 3 patients were transplanted and 23 patients died. The SD ratio at diagnosis and follow up predicted an increased risk of death/transplantation (HR 2.41 (1.09-5.29), p = 0.03; HR 5.02 (1.27-19.77), p = 0.02 respectively), retaining its predictive value at diagnosis in bivariate models with 6MWD (HR 2.18 (1.06-4.08)), WHO Functional Class (HR 2.33 (1.04-5.21)) and TAPSE (HR 2.36 (1.07-5.19)), all p < 0.05. The SD ratio carries prognostic value at diagnosis and follow up in IPAH. Its further evaluation alongside current PAH risk stratification parameters should be considered.
