Management of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with mechanical circulatory support: a role for low-molecular-weight heparins? Patients on mechanical circulatory support are at high risk of bleeding, particularly intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The management of ICH in patients needing anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies remains a challenge. We report our initial experience of ICH management with low-molecular-weight heparin in patients with mechanical circulatory support, without bleeding or thromboembolic complications.
