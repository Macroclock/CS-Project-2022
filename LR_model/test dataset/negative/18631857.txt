Transplant-associated hyperglycemia. As patient survival after solid organ transplantation continues to improve, comorbidites associated with chronic hyperglycemia will assume increasing importance in limiting outcomes and quality of life. New-onset diabetes mellitus commonly occurs in the posttransplant setting and is associated with multiple complications including graft loss, cardiovascular disease, infection, and death. Furthermore, recent studies have begun to highlight the very high posttransplant prevalence and the significant cardiovascular implications of the prediabetic states of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, indicating that the overall burden of transplantation-associated hyperglycemia is far greater than previously appreciated. Shared and distinct pathogenic factors and clinical repercussions exist among the organ-specific transplant scenarios. Diabetogenic immunosuppressive agents are common to all organ transplant settings, whereas glucose regulation is also strained by the restoration of failed hepatic and renal function. The atherogenic properties of hyperglycemia are particularly significant in the kidney transplant population, which has a marked predisposition to cardiovascular disease, whereas accelerated cardiac allograft vasculopathy and liver fibrosis have been associated with hyperglycemia in the heart and liver transplant settings, respectively. Aggressive screening will effectively detect transplant-associated hyperglycemia, whereas risk factor modification, lifestyle intervention and, where appropriate, drug therapy, may decrease its impact. Topics of future investigation should include the use of emerging diabetes therapies and avenues for the prevention and reversal of transplant-associated hyperglycemia.
