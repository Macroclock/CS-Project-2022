Two-Dimensional Speckle Tracking Echocardiography in Heart Transplant Patients: Two-Year Follow-Up of Right and Left Ventricular Function. Evolution of left and right ventricular (LV and RV) function after heart transplantation (HT) has not been well described. Our objective was to evaluate the evolution of echocardiographic parameters of both ventricles along the first 2 years after HT. We followed 31 HT recipients with serial echocardiograms for up to 2 years. Echocardiograms with AR ≥2R were excluded. We analyzed LV global longitudinal strain (LV GLS) by speckle tracking in 12 segments in four- and two-chamber views and RV global longitudinal strain (RV GLS) in four-chamber view. Control group included 25 healthy volunteers. Even though LVEF was preserved, LV GLS was reduced early post-HT (-17.7 ± 3.0 in HT vs. -20.7 ± 2.8 in controls, P = 0.02), improving progressively until its complete normalization 2 years after HT (-20.0 ± 3.7 vs. -20.7 ± 2.8, P = 0.60). TAPSE was impaired in the early post-HT period and increased progressively (11.9 ± 2.9 mm at baseline vs. 19.0 ± 3.6 mm at 2 years, P < 0.001). RV GLS rose during follow-up as well (-17.4 ± 3.5 at baseline vs. -22.6 ± 3.3 at 2 years, P = 0.001), reaching normal values 1 year after HT. In this series of HT recipients with uneventful postoperative course, LV and RV GLS values were significantly reduced early after HT and improved progressively until their complete normalization two and 1 year after HT, respectively. This is the first study to show a full recovery of LV and RV deformation parameters and offers "normal" strain values that, if confirmed in larger studies, could be useful for monitoring the evolution of HT recipients.
