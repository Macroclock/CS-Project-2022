Acquired hyperplastic gastric polyps in solid organ transplant patients. We report a series of patients who developed hyperplastic gastric polyps after solid organ transplantation. A retrospective review of patients with solid organ transplantation from January 1997 to December 1999 was performed. Patients with gastric polyps found during endoscopy were included. Demographic data, polyp characteristics (endoscopic and histological), time of endoscopy, and treatment regimens were analyzed. A total of 10 (seven men, three women) transplanted patients (six cardiac, three liver, and one kidney) with gastric polyps were identified. The median age was 61 yr (27-71 yr), and median time of endoscopy after transplantation was 11 months (3-28 months). Eight patients had endoscopy before or soon after transplantation, with no evidence of polyps. Nine patients had multiple polyps (three or more), and one had a single pedunculated polyp. Polyps were confined to the antrum in eight patients, antrum and body in one patient, and fundus in one patient. All polyps biopsied were found to be hyperplastic and without adenomatous or malignant changes. Cytomegalovirus serology was negative in nine patients. Each patient received standard immunosuppression that included a calcineurin inhibitor and steroids. Steroids were tapered and stopped by 3 months. Azathioprine was added in five patients and mycophenolate mofetil in one patient. The development of gastric polyps after organ transplantation has not been previously reported. The development of these gastric polyps (hyperplastic and multiple) is concerning as a malignant potential has been recognized in patients harboring multiple hyperplastic gastric polyps. The exact cause of these polyps is unknown. The association with immunosuppressive therapy as well as the natural history of these acquired hyperplastic gastric polyps needs further investigation.
