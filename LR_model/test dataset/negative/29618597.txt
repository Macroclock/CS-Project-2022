Regulation of Vascular Calcification by Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone and Its Agonists. Vascular calcification (VC) is a marker of the severity of atherosclerotic disease. Hormones play important roles in regulating calcification; estrogen and parathyroid hormones exert opposing effects, the former alleviating VC and the latter exacerbating it. To date no treatment strategies have been developed to regulate clinical VC. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and its agonist (GHRH-A) on the blocking of VC in a mouse model. Young adult osteoprotegerin-deficient mice were given daily subcutaneous injections of GHRH-A (MR409) for 4 weeks. Significant reductions in calcification of the aortas of MR409-treated mice were paralleled by markedly lower alkaline phosphatase activity and a dramatic reduction in the expression of transcription factors, including the osteogenic marker gene  GHRH-A controls osteogenesis in smooth muscle cells by targeting cross talk between protein kinase A and nuclear factor ÎºB (p65) and through the suppression of reactive oxygen species production that induces the  'alkaline phosphatase', 'growth hormone-releasing hormone', 'myocytes, smooth muscle', 'osteogenesis', 'reactive oxygen species'
