Successful Bridge-to-Transplant of Functionally Univentricular Patients With a Modified Continuous-Flow Ventricular Assist Device. A continuous flow extracorporeal ventricular assist device (VAD) was modified to support functionally univentricular infants and children awaiting heart transplantation. A centrifugal VAD, designed to flow from 1.5 to 8 L/min, was used as a bridge-to-transplant in four patients with functionally univentricular circulation. A variable restrictive recirculation shunt permitted lower flow ranges in small patients. In hypoxic patients, an oxygenator was incorporated into the circuit. From 2012 to 2015, the modified VAD was placed in four patients with Glenn physiology. Age ranged from 0.97 to 6.98 years (median = 2.2 yrs). Body surface area ranged from 0.41 to 0.84 m '-Cardiac', '-Mechanical circulatory support', '-Surgery', '-Transplantation', '-Univentricular', '-Ventricular assist device', 'Pediatric'
