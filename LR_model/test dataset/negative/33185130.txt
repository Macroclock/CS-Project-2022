St. Thomas and del Nido cardioplegia are superior to Custodiol cardioplegia in a rat model of donor heart. Cardiac transplantation is an effective treatment for advanced heart disease and protection of the donor organ is directly associated with post-transplantation outcomes. Cardioplegic strategies intend to protect the donor heart against ischemic injury during transplantation procedures. In our study, the effects of three different cardioplegia solutions were evaluated in a rat heart donor model in terms of cellular base.  'Custodiol', 'St. Thomas', 'cardioplegia', 'del Nido', 'donor heart', 'ischemia'
