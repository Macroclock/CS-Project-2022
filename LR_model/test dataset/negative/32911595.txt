Fingolimod (FTY720) Preserves High Energy Phosphates and Improves Cardiac Function in Heterotopic Heart Transplantation Model. During heart transplantation, donor heart leads to reduced oxygen supply resulting in low level of high energy phosphate (HEP) reserves in cardiomyocyte. Lower HEP is one of the underlying reasons of cell death due to ischemia. In this study we investigated the role of Fingolimod (FTY720) in heart transplantation ischemia. Eight groups of Sprague-Dawley rats ( 'cardiac function', 'coronary blood flow', 'fingolimod (FTY720)', 'high energy phosphates', 'poly (ADP ribose) polymerase'
