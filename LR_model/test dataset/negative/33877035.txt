Levosimendan for Treatment of Primary Graft Dysfunction After Heart Transplantation: Optimal Timing of Application. Primary graft dysfunction remains a serious problem after heart transplant. Pharmacological treatment with the calcium sensitizer levosimendan may be an additive treatment for primary graft dysfunction. Patients undergoing heart transplant between 2010 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed and divided depending on postoperative treatment with (n = 41) or without (n = 109) levosimendan. Recipients who received levosi mendan were further divided with regard to timing of levosimendan application (early group: started ≤48 hours posttransplant [n = 23]; late group: started >48 hours posttransplant [n = 18]). Patients who received levosimendan treatment displayed a remarkable incidence (87.8%) of postoperative primary graft dysfunction with need for venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and therefore often presented with perioperative morbidity. Patient with early application of levosimendan showed significantly decreased duration of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (5.1 ± 3.5 days vs 12.6 ± 9.3 days in those with late application; P < .01) and decreased mortality during venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (0.0% vs 33.3% in early vs late group; P < .01). In addition, compared with patients with late levosimendan application, patients with early application needed fewer blood transfusions (P < .05), had shorter ventilation times (279 ± 235 vs 428 ± 293 h; P = .03), and showed a trend of reduced incidence of postoperative renal failure (69.6% vs 94.4%; P = .06). Moreover, survival analyses indicated an increased survival for patients with early start of levosimendan therapy within the first 48 hours after heart transplant (P = .09). Pharmacotherapy with levosimendan may be a promising additive in the treatment of primary graft dysfunction after heart transplant. With administration of levosimendan within the first 48 hours posttransplant, rates of successful weaning from venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and outcomes after heart transplant were shown to increase.
