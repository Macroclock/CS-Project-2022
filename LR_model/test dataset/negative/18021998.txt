Cardiocyte nucleus shape as an indicator of heart graft aging. Morphometric publications based on the measurement of cardiocyte nuclei indicated their progressive hypertrophy ignoring, however, their shape, which is a deciding factor for the microscopic-based diagnosis of hypertrophy. We sought was to demonstrate how the shapes of cardiocyte nuclei change over time and correlate them with the thickness of the interventricular septum, (IVS) the biopsy site. We evaluated myocardial biopsies taken in the first week, first month, and then annually until posttransplant year 10. Only biopsies with no rejection were considered: grade "0" ISHLT (122 biopsies). The control group encompassed fragments from seven donor hearts. Cardiomyocyte nuclei were evaluated morphometrically. We calculated the length, breadth, perimeter, roundness, elongation, and fullness factors for correlation with the IVS thickness, and selected indices. The relationships between karyometry and IVS thickness (measured by ultrasound) as well as time were calculated by Spearman's correlation test. Among the examined indices, only nuclear length did not correlate significantly with follow-up time. Among the remaining indices, the strongest correlations with time were observed with regard to breadth (r = 0.214), perimeter (r = 0.150), roundness (r = -0.06) and fullness (r = 0.06), and finally elongation (r = 0.02). The decreasing thickness of the interventricular septum (r = -0.31) showed a weak correlation only with the cardiocyte nuclear length (r = -0.05). Graft aging imitates hypertrophy inasmuch as cardiocyte nuclei become wider despite the decreased thickness of the interventricular septum. Therefore, karyometric measurements do not reflect myocardial morphology.
