Trends and Outcomes of Atrial Fibrillation-Flutter Hospitalizations Among Heart Transplant Recipients (From the National Inpatient Sample). Atrial fibrillation-flutter (AF) has been described in 10% to 24% of patients after heart transplant (HT). Data on AF hospitalizations after HT are limited to single-center experiences. To bridge this gap, we performed an analysis of admissions for AF in HT patients from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) years 2000 to 2014.
