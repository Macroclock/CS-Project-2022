[Successful outcome of pregnancy and vaginal delivery in a heart transplant recipient]. The case is reported of a patient subjected 4 years before conception to a heart transplant for biventricular hypertrophic myocardiopathy. The woman undertook and successfully concluded a pregnancy without complication and at the 37th week delivered spontaneously and vaginally. Four years after the birth both the woman and the newborn had suffered no after-effects. The choice and possibility for a transplant patient to face up to pregnancy and childbirth depend essentially, from a medical point of view, on her general state of health and on the presence or otherwise of other associated pathologies, in addition to the will of the patient to tackle the risks attached to her transplanted condition. It is therefore fundamental, in all cases, for such patients to undergo clear and detailed preconceptional counseling.
