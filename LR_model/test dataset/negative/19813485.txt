Lung donation after cardiac death of recent heart transplant recipient. In June 2008, Gift of Life Michigan was notified of a potential donor. After the initial chart review, it was determined that the patient would be a candidate for donation after cardiac death. Two things made this case interesting: (1) the patient was an organ recipient himself, having received a heart transplant just a short time before his death, and (2) even though this was a donation after cardiac death and the patient had recently received the heart transplant, the patient's lungs and the left kidney were successfully recovered and used for transplant.
