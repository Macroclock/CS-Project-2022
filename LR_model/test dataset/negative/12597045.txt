Infections in the heart transplant recipient. The overall incidence of infection after transplantation has decreased with improved immunosuppressive agents, increased knowledge and use of prophylaxis, and better detection and treatment of infection. Nevertheless, infection continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in heart transplant recipients. The knowledgeable nurse in any setting who cares for a transplant recipient must be aware of the lifelong susceptibility to common and opportunistic infections. The transplant recipient and his or her family must also be aware of the risks of early opportunistic infection. Infection is a lifelong concern for all persons on immunosuppressant medications, and the individual must learn appropriate precautions to reduce this risk. Hand washing and avoidance of infected individuals are the most important self-care actions that the transplant patient should adopt. Recipients must also learn to monitor for subtle signs of infection. The nurse is responsible for teaching self-care to patients and family members. Ultimately, a team effort by the patient, family, nurses, and physicians can reduce the risk of infection in this vulnerable population.
