Heart transplantation following myocardial infarction due to Takayasu's arteritis. We report a 14-yr-old girl who presented with cardiogenic shock because of compression of the left main coronary artery secondary to Takayasu's arteritis. The patient required cardiac transplantation with hemi-arch replacement at the time of transplant because of ascending aortitis. To our knowledge, this is the first case of cardiac transplantation in Takayasu's arteritis to be reported in the literature.
