Listing Criteria for Heart Transplant: Role of Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test and of Prognostic Scores. Patients with advanced heart failure (AdHF) have a reduced quality of life and poor prognosis. A heart transplant (HT) is an effective treatment for such patients. Still, because of a shortage of donor organs, the final decision to place a patient without contraindications on the HT waiting list is based on detailed risk-benefit analysis. Cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) play a pivotal role in guiding selection in patients with AdHF considered for an HT. Furthermore, several validated multivariable predicting scores obtained through various techniques, including the CPETs, are available and part of the decision-making process for HT listing.
