Primary graft failure after cardiac transplantation: prevalence, prognosis and risk factors. Primary graft failure (PGF) is a common and devastating complication, despite the advances in perioperative treatment. We aim to evaluate the prevalence of PGF and its impact on survival and to explore associated risk factors. From November 2003 through December 2015, 290 patients submitted to cardiac transplantation were classified into non-PGF (243; 84%) and PGF (47; 16%) groups. The characteristics of the recipients were similar regarding age (54.6 ± 10.6 vs 54.0 ± 9.4 years; P = 0.74), male gender (78.2% vs 72.3%; P = 0.38) and transpulmonary gradient (9.4 ± 4.2 vs 10.5 ± 5.6 mmHg; P = 0.15); donors to the PGF group had similar age (35.5 ± 11.4 vs 37.5 ± 10.7 years; P = 0.27) but were predominantly female (21% vs 42.6%; P = 0.002). Mean ischaemic (89.0 ± 36.8 vs 103.3 ± 44.7 min; P = 0.019) and cardiopulmonary bypass (92.8 ± 14.5 vs 126.3 ± 62.4 min; P < 0.001) times were longer in the PGF group. Length of hospital stay was 13.5 ± 7.5 vs 28.9 ± 35.2 days (P= 0.005). Hospital mortality was 4.1% [1.6% for non-PGF and 17% for PGF (P < 0.001)]. Survival at 1, 5 and 10 years was 95.5 ± 1.3% vs 55.3 ± 7.3%, 84.1 ± 2.5% vs 47.4 ± 7.6% and 67.1 ± 3.8% vs 14.4 ± 12%, respectively (P < 0.001). Risk factors for PGF were female donor [odds ratio (OR): 2.56; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.29-5.09; P = 0.007], total ischaemic time (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.00-1.02; P = 0.032) and preoperative mechanical extracorporeal circulatory support (OR: 11.90; 95% CI: 2.62-54.12; P = 0.001). Our results demonstrate that PGF is associated with poor outcomes that extend beyond the 1st month and the 1st year after heart transplantation. We found female donor, total ischaemic time and preoperative mechanical extracorporeal circulatory support to be risk factors for PGF.
