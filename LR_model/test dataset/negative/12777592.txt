Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder in parents of transplant recipients: incidence, severity, and related factors. To examine the incidence, severity, and factors related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in parents of pediatric solid organ transplant recipients. A total of 170 caregivers of pediatric transplant recipients completed self-report measures of psychological functioning between 10 and 38 months after their child's most recent transplant. Demographic data, child health variables, and ratings of medical attitudes and social functioning were also collected to help explain individual differences in psychological functioning. Although caregivers of pediatric transplant recipients did not report elevated levels of depression or anxiety, they did report elevated levels of PTSD symptoms. Multiple regression analyses revealed that PTSD symptoms were most strongly associated with parent reports of child health, family impact of the transplant, and attitudes toward medical caregivers. PTSD seems to be relatively common in parents of pediatric transplant recipients and may be largely the result of how parents perceive and interpret the transplant experience.
