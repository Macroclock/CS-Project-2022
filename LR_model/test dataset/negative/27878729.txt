Features of the Left Ventricular Functional Geometry in Patients with Myocardial Diseases with Varying Degrees of Systolic Dysfunction. We revealed some features of the left ventricular functional geometry in patients with myocardial diseases with different degrees of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. A negative correlation was found between the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of the kinetics of the left ventricular wall during systole and ejection fraction in normal heart and in systolic dysfunction. The differences in the quantitative characteristics of the functional geometry between patients and normal subjects and between different groups of patients depended on the severityof left-ventricular systolic dysfunction. In particular, spatial heterogeneity index that characterizes heterogeneity of systolic movement of the wall segments and end-systolic Fourier shape-power index characterizing complexity of the left ventricle shape during systole differed significantly in the examined groups of patients and have the greatest diagnostic power.
