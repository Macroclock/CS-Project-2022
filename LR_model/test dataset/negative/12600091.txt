[Study on donor-specific antigens in inducing immunological tolerance]. To compare the effects of different donor-specific antigens, through different pathways, on the inducement of immunological tolerance. After the establishment of a stable rat cervical heterotopic heart transplantation model, donor specific transfusion (DST), donor specific spolenocyte (DSSL) and donor specific bone marrow (DSBM) were given to recipients 3-14 days prior to the transplantation through peripheral vein, portal vein and intrathymic injection respectively. Low dose CsA 5 mg/(kg.d) was given from the 3rd-14th day pre-transplantation to the 28th day post-transplantation. The survival time of cardiac grafts was monitored, meanwhile, the donor specific mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) and the subsets of T lymphocytes CD8+ were determined. DSBM and the administrative pathway of intrathymic injection achieved the best effects on the inducement of immunological tolerance and the improvement of graft survival. The donor specific antigens can induce the donor-specific immunological tolerance. It may be a practicable approach for the clinical experiments in the future.
