[Heart failure: ventricular assist devices and cardiac transplantation : A review of current surgical innovations]. End-stage heart failure is one of the leading causes of death in Germany. Cardiac transplantation is still considered the gold standard for the treatment of terminal heart failure; however, there is a discrepancy between patients on the waiting list and yearly performed transplantations. As an alternative, ventricular assist devices have achieved a high level of importance but treatment is still associated with challenges. Novel systems as well as innovative surgical techniques contribute to improving the safety and effectiveness of the treatment. To generate an overview of current surgical innovations in cardiac transplantation and mechanical circulatory support. A Medline search was conducted regarding innovations in cardiac transplantation and mechanical circulatory support. Not only the number of yearly performed cardiac transplantations has changed but also recipient profiles. While in the pioneering era of transplantation the typical candidate was young, not previously operated on and with lower levels of comorbidities, today's patients are significantly older, have been fitted with ventricular assist devices and have increased operative risk profiles. Modern methods of organ preservation enable longer transportation and operation times as well as an improved assessment of graft function and perspectives for graft optimization in the future. In the area of ventricular assist devices, advances in the reduction of the stroke rate seem to have been achieved by the latest generation devices. From a surgical perspective, less invasive surgical techniques with promising initial results have been established at numerous centers.
