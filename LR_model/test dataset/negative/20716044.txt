A comparative study on suture versus cuff anastomosis in mouse cervical cardiac transplant. To compare the cuff technique to traditional suture technique in establishing cervical heart transplant model in mice. Eighty transplants were performed by 1 surgeon, 40 using the cuff technique, and 40 using the suture technique, under the same circumstances. The cuff approach was significantly superior to conventional suture anastomosis in higher surgical successful rate, less surgery, and less ischemic time (P < .05). Suture anastomosis required an intensive microsurgical training and at least a 16x surgical microscope, while the cuff anastomosis required less learning time and a 10x surgical microscope. The cuff technique is the preferred method in cervical heart transplant model in mice.
