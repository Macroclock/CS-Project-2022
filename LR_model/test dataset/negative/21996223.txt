Lymphocyte subtypes CD3+, CD19+, CD16+CD56+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD3+HLA-DR+ in peripheral blood obtained from patients after thoracic organ transplantation. The aim of this study was to assess peripheral blood lymphocyte subtypes (CD3+, CD19+, CD16+CD56+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD3+HLA-DR+) obtained from thoracic organ recipients at various periods after transplantation. Seventeen patients after lung transplantation (LT) and 5 patients after heart transplantation (HT) included 13 males (76.5%) and 4 females (23.5%) of overall mean age at the time of transplantation of 46.7±11.55 years and mean body mass index of 21.1±4. Lymphocyte phenotypes were estimated using Simultest IMK Plus. A significant decrease in lymphocytes of the majority of subtypes was observed at 1 year posttransplantation compared with normal ranges: CD19+ B lymphocytes in 56% of patients, CD8+ T cells among 48% and CD16+CD56+ natural killer elements, 56%. In contrast, there were increased numbers of activated lymphocytes (CD3+HLA-DR+). Beyond the 1-year observation, we observed a trend to normalize parameters among the majority of subjects. A clear tendency to a decrease number of peripheral blood lymphocytes of various subtypes was observed among thoracic organ recipients in the first year posttransplantation with the exception of activated HLA-DR+ cells. After the first year, there was slow restoration of lymphocytes.
