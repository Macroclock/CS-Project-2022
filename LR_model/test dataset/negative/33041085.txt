Association of vimentin antibody and other non-HLA antibodies with treated antibody mediated rejection in heart transplant recipients. Non-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies have been implicated in heart transplantation rejection. However, targets of non-HLA antibodies remain elusive. Here, we utilized a panel of multiplex beads-based assay to determine the specificity of non-HLA antibodies following heart transplantation. We utilized a selected cohort of recipients who did not have HLA donor specific antibodies, but were diagnosed with antibody mediated rejection and treated for antibody mediated rejection. We found the presence of vimentin antibody was associated with treated antibody mediated rejection. Our results suggest that, in heart transplant recipients who are suspected of AMR but in the absence of HLA donor specific antibodies, non-HLA antibodies should be examined.
