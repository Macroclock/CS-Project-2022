A fatal case of bortezomib-induced lung toxicity in a young adult heart transplant recipient. Bortezomib is approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma but increasingly used in heart transplant (HTx) recipients with antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). Severe pulmonary toxicity is a rare complication in multiple myeloma patients treated with bortezomib, but has not been described in a solid organ transplant recipient. A 20-year-old man 7 years post-HTx presented with acute rejection with hemodynamic compromise. Endomyocardial biopsy showed mixed rejection (ISHLT grade 2R-3R acute cellular rejection (ACR) and pAMR 1 (I+) with diffuse C4d staining). Two new high MFI circulating MHC class-II donor-specific antibodies (DSA) were detected. Treatment included corticosteroids, antithymocyte globulin, plasmapheresis, IVIG, rituximab, and bortezomib (1.3 mg/m 'antibody-mediated rejection', 'bortezomib', 'heart transplant'
