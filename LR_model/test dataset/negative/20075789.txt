Echocardiography in the potential heart donor. The relationship between echocardiographic left ventricular(LV) systolic function (E-function) and pulmonary artery catheter(PAC) assessment of hemodynamic function (H-function) in potential heart donors is ill defined. We investigated this and determined (a) whether optimization could improve abnormal E-function, (b) feasibility and usefulness of repeat transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and (c) whether thyroid status and therapy affected E-function. Transthoracic E-function imaging was performed at baseline and 4 hr in potential donors (enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of tri-iodothyronine+/-methylprednisolone [MP] therapy) undergoing PAC-guided algorithmic optimization. Images were analyzed post hoc for LV wall thickness, ejection fraction, and Tei index. The study comprised 66 donors. Both LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and LV-Tei correlated with cardiac index (CI; P<0.001), and LV Tei was most frequently measurable and repeatable(P=0.01). Normal LVEF independently predicted end-assessment H-functional suitability (odds ratio 1.05, 95% confidence interval 1.007-1.088 [P=0.021]) but had poor specificity. Initial subnormal E-function was identified in 29 of 66 of hearts, of which 58% (17/29) achieved H-function suitability criteria. In 52 hearts, repeat E-function assessment was possible. Nineteen of 52 had initially subnormal E-function, which improved in over half (53%). H-function could be manipulated to meet functional suitability criteria for transplant even without E-function change. Neither initial thyroid status nor hormonal therapy affected LV function. Echocardiography is possible in most potential heart donors. Normal E-function predicts hemodynamic suitability for transplantation but lacks specificity. More than 50% of hearts with subnormal E-function can attain hemodynamic transplantation criteria after donor management. Repeat echocardiography is feasible but has a limited role. Both initial echocardiography and PAC-guided management should be used routinely.
