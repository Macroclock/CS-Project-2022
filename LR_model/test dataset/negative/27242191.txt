Clinical Utility of Preimplantation Homograft Cultures in Patients Undergoing Congenital Cardiac Surgery. Institutional practice at our hospital (Boston Children's Hospital) is to culture homografts before implantation during congenital cardiac surgery. Over a 4-year period, 5% (73 of 1376) of these cultures were positive, but the results had minimal clinical impact. Our experience demonstrates that there is limited utility in preimplantation cultures of cardiac homografts.
