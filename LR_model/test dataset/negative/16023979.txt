Treatment of hepatitis C in potential kidney and heart transplant patients. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is common in certain solid organ transplant recipients, most notably in those undergoing liver or kidney transplantation. Infection typically antedates transplantation but may have been acquired at the time of transplantation via infected blood products or organs. A more rapid and aggressive course of HCV-related infection and liver disease is the major concern in organ transplant recipients compared with immunocompetent patients. HCV-related liver disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease treated by dialysis or transplantation. The outcome of HCV infection in renal and liver transplant recipients has been extensively investigated, whereas literature on HCV-related liver disease among patients with orthotopic heart transplantation is scanty. This article reviews the literature concerning the treatment of HCV-related liver disease in renal and orthotopic heart transplantation.
