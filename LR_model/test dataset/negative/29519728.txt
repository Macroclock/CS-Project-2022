Optimizing risk stratification in heart failure and the selection of candidates for heart transplantation. Selecting patients for heart transplantation is challenging. We aimed to identify the most important risk predictors in heart failure and an approach to optimize the selection of candidates for heart transplantation. Ambulatory patients followed in our center with symptomatic heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40% prospectively underwent a comprehensive baseline assessment including clinical, laboratory, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing parameters. All patients were followed for 60 months. The combined endpoint was cardiac death, urgent heart transplantation or need for mechanical circulatory support, up to 36 months. In the 263 enrolled patients (75% male, age 54±12 years), 54 events occurred. The independent predictors of adverse outcome were ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO VE/VCO 'Cardiopulmonary exercise testing', 'Consumo de oxigénio de pico', 'Declive da eficiência ventilatória', 'Estratificação de risco', 'Heart failure', 'Heart transplantation', 'Insuficiência cardíaca', 'Peak oxygen consumption', 'Prova de esforço cardiorrespiratória', 'Risk stratification', 'Transplantação cardíaca', 'Ventilatory efficiency slope'
