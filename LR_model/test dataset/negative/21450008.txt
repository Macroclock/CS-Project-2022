HLA antibodies in pediatric heart transplantation. We have analyzed the impact of anti-HLA antibodies present in the patients' circulation prior and/or following heart transplantation in a population of 108 pediatric recipients. Anti-HLA class I and class II antibodies were monitored by traditional CDC using donor and panel T and B lymphocytes and by SPA for detection of DSA. There was a highly significant correlation between the development of AMR and presence of CDC- or SPA-detected DSA. However, the fraction of the transplant population which remained AMR-free was much higher among patients with SPA-detected compared to CDC-detected DSA. Furthermore, long-term graft survival was negatively affected only by cytotoxic, complement-fixing anti-HLA class I antibodies developing following transplantation. Anti-HLA class I or class II antibodies detected by SPA had no effect on long-term survival rates.
