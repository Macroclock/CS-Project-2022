Effects of immunosuppression induced by thalidomide and cyclosporine in heterotopic heart transplantation in rabbits. Because of its anti-inflammatory and immunodepressive effects, thalidomide has been used for the treatment of dermatologic diseases and of host-versus-graft reactions in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. We evaluated the immunosuppressive action of thalidomide alone or in combination with cyclosporine on the prevention of rejection of heterotopic cardiac allografts in rabbits. Fifty rabbits were used including 25 donors and 25 recipients. Recipient animals were divided into five groups (n = 5 each): group 1 (control), non-immunosuppressed animals; group II, animals immunosuppressed with cyclosporine (10 mg/kg per day); group III, immunosuppressed with thalidomide (100 mg/kg per day); group IV, immunosuppressed with cyclosporine (5.0 mg/kg per day); and group V, immunosuppressed with cyclosporine (5.0 mg/kg per day) in combination with thalidomide (50 mg/kg per day). The medications were administered through an orogastric catheter starting on the day before the transplant. The heart of the donor was implanted into the recipient's abdomen. The combination of thalidomide and cyclosporine showed the lowest histopathological rejection score (P < .05). Thalidomide administered alone or in combination with cyclosporine was effective against rejection, significantly increasing survival (P < .01). Thalidomide may be considered to be an adjuvant immunosuppressant.
