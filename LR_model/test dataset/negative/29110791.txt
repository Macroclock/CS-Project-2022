Preanesthetic evaluation of the patient with end-stage heart failure. Heart failure (HF) currently affects more than 5 million patients in the United States [1]. Advanced HF is associated with high mortality and poor quality of life. It is estimated that between 5% and 10% of all patients with HF have an advanced form of the disease [1]. Orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) is an accepted therapy for stage D HF [3] (Fig.Â 1). Unfortunately, the number of patients with the disease exceeds the number of available organs. This makes appropriate patient selection vital in the field of heart transplantation. Anesthetic evaluation of the patient presenting for OHT or mechanical circulatory support (MCS) implantation is a vital component of the patient's perioperative course. Patients often have had extensive diagnostic testing and assessment prior to being listed for OHT or considered for MCS implantation. Because of the often urgent nature of these procedures, the cardiac anesthesiologist must conduct a focused review of the relevant information and perform a focused patient interview and physical exam.
