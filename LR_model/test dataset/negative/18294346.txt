The effect of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) on ischemia/reperfusion injury in cardiac transplantation. We investigated the role of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) in ischemia/reperfusion injury in cardiac transplantation. SLPI-/- mouse hearts and wild-type (WT) controls were transplanted immediately or after 10 h of cold ischemia (CI). Recombinant SLPI (rSLPI) was added to the preservation solution or given systemically. After evaluation of myocardial performance, grafts were investigated for histology, SLPI, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, NF-kappaB and protease expression at indicated time points. Early myocardial contraction was profoundly impaired in SLPI-/- hearts exposed to CI and associated with high intra-graft protease expression. Systemic administration of rSLPI had no effect, however, when SLPI was added to the preservation solution, myocardial contraction was restored to normal. At 10 days, inflammation, myocyte vacuolization and necrosis were significantly more severe in SLPI-/- hearts. SLPI gene expression was detected in WT mice at 12 and 24 h and was significantly higher after CI. SLPI protein was observed at 24 h and 10 days. High intra-graft concentrations of SLPI after administration of rSLPI were inversely correlated with protease levels early and TGF-beta expression late after reperfusion. SLPI plays a crucial role in early myocardial performance and postischemic inflammation after cardiac transplantation. A dual inhibitory effect on protease and TGF-beta expression might be the underlying mechanism.
