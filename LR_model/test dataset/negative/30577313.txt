Terminal Ileac Ulcers Mimicked Post-transplantation Lymphoproliferative Disorder in a Heart Recipient Treated With Everolimus: A Case Report. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a well-recognized and potentially fatal complication of cardiac transplantation that commonly involves the gastrointestinal tract. Herein, we report a case of life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding from recurrent terminal ileac ulcers mimicking PTLD in a heart recipient treated with everolimus (EVL).
