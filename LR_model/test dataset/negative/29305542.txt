Monitoring of Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-Specific Cell-Mediated Immunity in Heart Transplant Recipients: Clinical Utility of the QuantiFERON-CMV Assay for Management of Posttransplant CMV Infection. The clinical utility of the QuantiFERON-CMV (QFN-CMV) assay in heart transplant recipients was assessed. Forty-four cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seropositive patients were enrolled: 17 received antiviral prophylaxis, and 27 were managed preemptively. CMV-DNAemia monitoring was performed by the use of a quantitative real-time PCR assay. The QFN-CMV assay was retrospectively performed on blood samples collected at five posttransplant time points. A higher proportion of patients with an indeterminate QFN-CMV result after the suspension of prophylaxis than of patients who showed a global T-cell responsiveness developed CMV infection ( 'CMV DNAemia', 'cell-mediated immunity', 'cytomegalovirus', 'cytomegalovirus prevention strategies', 'heart transplant'
