Geographic disparities in access to organ transplantation in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, geographic variations in access to transplantation seem to exist-median waiting time to transplantation ranges between 305 and 1,236 days for kidney recipients, 36 and 73 days for liver recipients, and 66 and 667 days for heart recipients (although this latter example must be interpreted with caution). These variations may result from a number of factors. Different patterns of end-stage organ disease are particularly relevant for patients with kidney failure. Protocols for transplant assessment are now available and may reduce inequality. Regional variations in donation rates also exist but are poorly understood.
