Successful heart transplantation in patients with active Staphylococcus bloodstream infection and suspected mechanical circulatory support device infection. An active bloodstream infection (BSI) is typically considered a contraindication to heart transplantation (HT). However, in some patients with Staphylococcus bacteremia and mechanical circulatory support device infection, positive blood cultures may persist until removal of the infected device, and eradicating the infection prior to HT may not be possible. We report the outcomes of six patients with active Staphylococcus BSI at the time of HT. All cases of HT performed at The Mount Sinai Hospital from 2009 through 2015 were reviewed. All patients with a mechanical circulatory support device and an active Staphylococcus BSI at the time of HT were included. Six patients with active Staphylococcus bacteremia and suspected mechanical circulatory support device infection underwent HT. All patients were bacteremic with Staphylococcus species at the time of HT. All were managed with antimicrobial therapy, radical debridement at the time of HT, and limited use of immunosuppression, and all survived until hospital discharge with no evidence of relapsed Staphylococcus infection. These results suggest that some carefully selected patients with active Staphylococcus bacteremia and suspected mechanical circulatory support device infection may safely undergo HT, and that HT may effectively eliminate the underlying infection.
