Alteration of the left ventricular contractile reserve in heart transplant patients: a dobutamine stress strain rate imaging study. Strain rate imaging (SRI), a recently developed Doppler-derived process, allows quantification of myocardial systolic function. We investigate whether SRI quantifies the contractile reserve during dobutamine stress tests in heart transplant patients (HT), when compared with normal individuals. An incremental dobutamine test (5 to 40 microg/kg per minute) was performed in 10 HT and 15 control subjects, all of whom displayed normal coronary angiography. Gray-scale and color myocardial Doppler data were acquired in standard B-mode views at baseline, low-dose, peak, and recovery. Longitudinal SR was processed from the myocardial velocities for each segment. The changes in maximal systolic SR were used to quantify myocardial contractile reserve. Dobutamine infusion failed to induce clinical symptoms or electrocardiographic (ECG) changes in either group. Visually determined wall motion score was considered normal in all segments for each stage of the dobutamine stress. Heart rate was augmented similarly in both groups during dobutamine infusion. In controls, systolic SR increased gradually with incremental dobutamine dose and returned to baseline values upon recovery. Conversely, in HT patients, the increase in systolic SR was blunted at peak dobutamine, at which point it was significantly different vs controls. Quantitative assessment of myocardial function using SRI during dobutamine stress revealed an impaired contractile reserve in HT patients with normal coronary angiography. These subtle changes in regional myocardial function could not be identified using visual wall motion scoring. Additional studies are necessary to evaluate whether SR imaging detection of contractile reserve impairment will improve clinical efficiency or event prediction in this population.
