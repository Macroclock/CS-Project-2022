PD-L1/PD-1 signal deficiency promotes allogeneic immune responses and accelerates heart allograft rejection. PD-L1, a ligand for programmed death 1 (PD-1), delivers a negative costimulatory signal to T cells and plays a critical role in the regulation of peripheral tolerance. We used PD-L1(-/-) mice to evaluate the role of the PD-L1 signal on allogeneic immune responses in vivo and the underlying mechanisms. Heart transplantation was performed from PD-L1(-/-) donors or recipients in major histocompatibility complex fully mismatched mouse combinations. The immunologic function of allograft recipients was evaluated ex vivo by enzyme-linked immunospot, mixed lymphocytes reaction, cytotoxic T lymphocyte, and flow cytometry. Our results demonstrated that PD-L1(-/-) T cells proliferated vigorously under alloantigen stimulation, and also that the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from PD-L1(-/-) mice exhibited a stronger allostimulatory activity compared with that in wild-type mice. Heart allografts were rejected at an accelerated rate in both PD-L1(-/-) donors and recipients. This was associated with significantly augmented donor specific T-cell proliferation and antidonor cytotoxic T lymphocyte activities, and enhanced Th1- or Th2-type immune responses of heart allograft recipients. Absence of PD-L1 input triggers a stimulatory signal to effector T cells and APCs, accelerating heart allograft rejection. Engagement of the PD-L1 signal on T cells or APCs may be necessary to induce transplant tolerance.
