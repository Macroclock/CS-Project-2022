Accepting hepatitis C virus-infected donor hearts for transplantation: Multistep consent, unrealized opportunity, and the Stanford experience. The current mismatch between supply and demand of organs has prompted transplant clinicians to consider innovative solutions to broaden the donor pool. Advancements of direct-acting antiviral agent (DAA) therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) have allowed entertaining the use of viremic donor organs in nonviremic recipients. In this report, we describe the evolution of HCV treatment, ethics and informed consent, cost-effectiveness of HCV medications in treating acute HCV post-transplantation, and the Stanford experience with two HCV-viremic donor heart transplantations. We describe excellent short-term outcomes post-heart transplantation with HCV NAT-positive organs. The availability of this therapy may expand the donor pool. While we await larger-scale clinical data on the effectiveness and safety of DAA therapy in patients after heart transplantation, many transplant centers have already started accepting organs from HCV-infected donors, balancing the unknown long-term risks versus the benefits of shorter wait times and expansion of the donor pool. Protocols and multidisciplinary teams are needed to effectively communicate risk to potential recipients, to ensure timely DAA access, and to implement appropriate clinical follow-up in order to achieve excellent clinical outcomes and to maximize the donor pool by utilizing HCV-infected organs for heart transplantation.
