Tricuspid annuloplasty significantly reduces early tricuspid regurgitation after biatrial heart transplantation. The incidence of tricuspid annuloplasty (TR) observed early after cardiac biatrial implantation is unpredictable and in our experience not infrequently problematic. Although the bicaval method of implant may reduce the incidence of TR, its benefit has not been conclusively documented. In an attempt to reduce the incidence of TR observed early after cardiac transplantation, 25 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac transplantation received donor heart tricuspid annuloplasty (TA) with either a DeVega or Ring technique. Early transthoracic echocardiograms were analyzed and compared with an immediately prior and consecutive cohort of 25 patients undergoing transplantation without TA. The biatrial technique of cardiac transplantation with a Cabrol modification was used for donor heart implant in both groups. Echocardiograms obtained 5 days after cardiac transplantation were reviewed in blinded fashion. TR was scored 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. Donor and recipient characteristics were not different between groups. No hospital deaths occurred in either group. Patients undergoing transplantation without TA had a higher TR score, 1.3 (range 0-3), than did patients with TA, 0.7 (range 0-1.5, p = 0.002). Moderate or severe TR was present in 8 of 25 patients without TA compared with 0 of 25 patients with TA (p = 0.004). No patients required permanent pacemaker. TA can significantly reduce the incidence of early postoperative TR after biatrial cardiac transplant without adding to the complexity of operation.
