Nontransplant surgical options for congestive heart failure. A wide array of surgical options are currently available for the treatment of congestive heart failure ranging from traditional coronary artery bypass grafting to total artificial heart implantation. The indications for each procedure depend on the severity of disease and the individual patients desires. Some surgical options are indicated for patients with moderate disease and prevent worsening heart failure, whereas other procedures are limited to patients who will only survive with high-risk surgery. Ongoing technologic advances are increasing the number of patients that benefit from the reparative surgical treatment of congestive heart failure.
