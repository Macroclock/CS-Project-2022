Utility of the Biomarker CA125 in the Diagnosis of Cellular Rejection in Allogeneic Heart Transplantation. To analyze the relationship of the antigen carbohydrate 125 (CA125) biomarker with the cellular rejection of the heart graft during the first year after transplantation. Retrospective study of consecutive heart transplant (HTx) patients for 1.5 years. The total number of patients included in the study was 23 with a total of 103 follow-ups. In all patients, CA125 was determined before HTx and determined post-HTx in every follow-up. These were performed during months 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12. Endomyocardial biopsy was performed in all revisions to assess the degree of graft rejection in the pathologic study. The biopsy results were grouped into 1. absence of rejection and 2. presence of some degree of rejection. The mean pretransplant CA125 value presented a median of 120 U/mL with an interquartile range of 28.8 U/mL. One month after transplantation, the value was reduced by 20% and at 2 months by 81%. In subsequent reviews, plasma values were always between 10 and 20 U/mL. When comparing the values by periods and according to the presence or absence of rejection, no significant differences were found other than a slight elevation at the 6-month checkup (P = .03) but without clinical relevance, because the CA125 value was slightly higher in biopsy results without rejection. The rapid reduction of CA125 corroborates its usefulness as a marker of congestion in heart failure. This biomarker is not useful for predicting rejection. However, in cases of very severe rejections that occurred with systemic congestion, it could be raised. It would be necessary to corroborate this hypothesis in a larger study with a higher number of severe rejections.
