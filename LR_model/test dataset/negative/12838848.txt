[Case history of mitochondrial cytopathy with cardiac expression]. Childhood dilated cardiomyopathies comprise a wide aetiological spectrum for which the prognosis and treatment sometimes vary considerably. We report the case of a patient affected by a rare form of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy in whom the diagnosis of acute myocarditis had initially been made. The progression was fatal even though the patient was awaiting a cardiac transplant. Beyond the difficulties of diagnosis and treatment of this pathology, this clinical case underlines the significance of an early aetiological diagnosis based on the results of an endo-myocardial biopsy. Cardiac transplantation should be envisaged for this type of patient based not only on the clinical status but equally by taking account of the prognosis of this disease for which deterioration can sometimes be very rapid.
