Triple bridge-to-transplant in a case of giant cell myocarditis complicated by human leukocyte antigen sensitization and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II. Bridge-to-bridge experience has documented the feasibility of a switch from short-term to long-term mechanical circulatory support until heart transplant. We describe a case of irreversible cardiogenic shock due to giant cell myocarditis treated consecutively with extracorporal membrane oxygenation, bi-ventricular assist device, and total artificial heart. The postoperative course was complicated by human leukocyte antigen sensitization and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II. Our patient successfully underwent heart transplant after 10 months of support and was discharged in good condition. This case illustrates suitable device selection for myocarditis and represents two treatable immunological complications.
