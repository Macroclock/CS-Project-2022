HeartWare-HVAD for end-stage heart failure: a review of clinical experiences with ≥50 patients. Despite the improvements in medical and surgical treatments, the incidence of end-stage heart failure (ESHF) continues to increase. Different mechanical systems have been adopted to support failing left ventricles. Among continuous-flow devices, the HeartWare-HVAD was the first to use a centrifugal pump rather than an axial one. Areas covered: In this review article, we provide an overview of the HeartWare-HVAD as a ventricular assist device for ESHF, discussing indications, echocardiographic assessment, surgical techniques, outcomes, concerns and controversies. Scientific literature was reviewed with a MEDLINE search strategy combining 'HeartWare' or 'HVAD' with 'heart failure'. A total of 263 papers were found using the reported search. From these, 16 were identified to provide the best evidence on the subject reporting outcomes in ≥50 patients. Expert commentary: HeartWare-HVAD is a minute device that provides full circulatory support in patients with ESHF. Its main indication remains bridge to heart transplantation (HTx). Median sternotomy is the preferred technique of implantation although less invasive procedures have been described. Early outcomes are satisfactory. Nevertheless, some fearing complications still occur during the mid- and long-term follow-up. Further technical developments and optimal medical management will guarantee better outcomes.
