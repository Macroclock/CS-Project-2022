Neurologic aspects of multiple organ transplantation. Complex multiorgan failure may require simultaneous transplantation of several organs, including heart-lung, kidney-pancreas, or multivisceral transplantation. Solid organ transplantation can also be combined with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to modulate immunologic response to a solid organ allograft. Combined multiorgan transplantation may offer a lower rate of allograft rejection and lower immunosuppression needs. In recent years, intestinal and multivisceral transplantations became viable as a rescue treatment for patients with irreversible intestinal failure who can no longer tolerate total parenteral nutrition with 70% survival after 5 years which is comparable to other types of solid organ allografts. Post-transplant neurologic complications were reported in up to 86% of allograft recipients and greatly overlap in intestinal and multivisceral allograft recipients, without a significant effect on the outcome of transplantation. Other common organ combinations in multiorgan transplantation include kidney-pancreas, which is mostly used for patients with renal failure and uncontrolled diabetes, and heart-lung for patients with congenital heart disease and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Kidney-pancreas transplantation frequently results in an improvement of diabetic complications, including diabetic neuropathy. Heart-lung allograft recipients have very similar clinical course and spectrum of neurologic complications to lung transplant recipients. At this time there are no reports of an increased risk of graft-versus-host disease with combined transplantation of solid organ allograft and hematopoietic stem cells. Chronic immunosuppression and complex toxic-metabolic disturbances after multiorgan transplantation create a permissive environment for development of a wide spectrum of neurologic complications which largely resemble complications after transplantations of individual components of complex multiorgan allografts.
