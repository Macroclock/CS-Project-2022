[Allogeneic chimerism induced by B7 antisense peptide pre-treated splenocytes prolongs the survival of allograft in mice]. To investigate the roles of B7 antisense peptide (B7AP) in blocking the CD28-B7 pathway and inducing the allogeneic chimerism. B7 antisense peptide was synthesized by solid phase synthetic methods and purified with HPLC. The C57BL/6 splenocytes of mice were pre-treated by B7AP, and subsequently injected in travenously to BALB/c mice. Three days later the mice were injected with fresh-made bone marrow cells derived from C57BL/6 mice. The B7 expression and allogeneic chimerism were analyzed with FACS. The lymphocyte proliferation reaction and the mice pinna cardiac transplantation model were exerted to study the relation between chimerism and prolongation of allograft in vitro and in vivo. Lymphoproliferation of the splenocytes derived from BALB/c mice immunized with the B7AP pretreated C57BL/6 splenocytes versus splenocytes from C57BL/6 mice was inhibited dramatically with a inhibition rates up to 43%. Under this condition, the allogeneic chimerism was successfully induced after BMT. Both the chimerism and the survival of allogeneic cardiac grafts were prolonged over 100 days (n = 6). Synthetic B7 antisense peptide can induce allogeneic chimerism in mice and consequently prolong the survival of allogeneic cardiac grafts.
