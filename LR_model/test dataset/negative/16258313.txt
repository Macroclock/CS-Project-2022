Strategies for tolerance induction in nonhuman primates. Recent advances in the field of reconstructive surgery and immunology resulted in increased interest in composite tissue allograft (CTA) transplantation. Up to date, more than 50 CTA transplants have been reported in humans. A significant number of experimental studies on CTA transplants under different protocols of tolerance-inducting strategies have been reported in small-animal models. There is however, a limited number of CTA transplants performed in nonhuman primates. To reach the ultimate clinical success in CTA transplantation, more experimental studies on tolerance induction in nonhuman primates are needed to apply these immunomodulatory protocols to CTA transplants in humans. In this review, strategies for tolerance induction in the nonhuman primate model in solid organ and CTA transplants are presented in 3 major categories: chimerism induction, T-cell depletion, and costimulatory receptor blockade.
