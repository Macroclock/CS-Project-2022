Heart transplantation. This paper briefly and subjectively reviews a number of the modest or tentative, but noteworthy, advances in heart transplantation that have been made during the past 18 months or so. The advances reviewed concern the selection of recipients, the management of the heart transplantation waiting list, the management of donors, post-heart transplant monitoring of immunological status, the early diagnosis of rejection, the role of mammalian target of rapamycine inhibitors and induction agents, and the definition and grading of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. The findings reviewed indicate progress in the clarification of issues that were in most cases already being investigated. Further studies will in general be needed before corresponding measures are adopted in clinical practice.
