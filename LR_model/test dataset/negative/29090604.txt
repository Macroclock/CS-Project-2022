Symptom Experience, Self-Care Adherence, and Quality of Life Among Heart Transplant Recipients in South Korea. Among heart transplant recipients, the perceived quality of life (QOL) is a key indicator of successful transplantation. QOL is affected by posttransplant treatments, including immunosuppressive therapy or self-care. However, few studies have evaluated QOL after heart transplantation in South Korea. This study aimed to investigate posttransplant symptoms associated with immunosuppressant, self-care adherence, and QOL in 105 heart transplant recipients in South Korea. Educational status (β = -1.05, p = .013), symptoms (β = -3.98, p = .004), and diet (β = 0.38, p < .001) were found to affect subjects' overall QOL. In addition to these factors, caregivers and the duration of heart disease (years) were found to be influencing factors, depending on the individual QOL subdimension. These findings highlight the importance of controlling symptoms and managing medications as well as of self-care (particularly dietary compliance). Educational programs targeting beneficial changes in lifestyle, including diet, are needed. 'heart disease', 'quality of life', 'self-care', 'symptom perception', 'transplantation'
