Early outcomes using hepatitis C-positive donors for cardiac transplantation in the era of effective direct-acting anti-viral therapies. Given the shortage of suitable donor hearts for cardiac transplantation, and the favorable safety and efficacy of current agents used to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV), our institution recently piloted transplantation of select patients using HCV-positive donors. Between September 2016 and March 2017, 12 HCV-naive patients and 1 patient with a history of treated HCV underwent heart transplantation (HT) using hearts from HCV-positive donors after informed consent. Patients who acquired HCV were referred to hepatology and treated with direct-acting anti-viral therapies (DAAs). Data collection and analysis were performed with institutional review board approval. At the time of HT, mean age of recipients was 53 ± 10 years, and 8 patients (61.5%) were on left ventricular assist device support. After consent to consider an HCV-positive heart, mean time to HT was 11 ± 12 days. Nine of 13 patients (69%) developed HCV viremia after transplant, including 8 who completed DAA treatment and demonstrated cure, as defined by a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment. One patient died during Week 7 of his treatment due to pulmonary embolism. DAAs were well tolerated in all treated patients. In the era of highly effective DAAs, the use of HCV-positive donors represents a potential approach to safely expand the donor pool. Additional follow-up is needed to elucidate long-term outcomes.
