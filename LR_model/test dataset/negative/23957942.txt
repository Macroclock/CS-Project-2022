Twelve-hour reanimation of a human heart following donation after circulatory death. Despite increasing use of donation after cardiac death (DCD) and encouraging results for non-cardiac transplants, DCD cardiac transplantation has not been widely adopted because, (1) the DCD heart sustains warm ischaemic injury during the death process and (2) conventional static cold storage significantly adds to the ischaemic injury. We have developed a simple system for perfusion of the DCD heart with cold crystalloid solution using gravity-feed that can reduce ischaemic injury and potentially render the heart suitable for transplantation. This report describes the first application of this technique to a human DCD heart with good functional metabolic recovery over 12h on an ex vivo rig.
