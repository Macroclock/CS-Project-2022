[Health-related quality of life after heart transplantation]. Quality of life late after heart transplantation is reported to be comparable with that of the general population. However, peak exercise capacity remained approximately 60% of what was normal between 1 and 10 years after transplantation. The gap between patients' good quality of life and their impaired exercise tolerance is not yet explained. The purpose of our study was to examine the relation between quality of life and exercise- related variables in heart transplant recipients (HTR). Then, the results of these examinations were compared with those of patients having congestive heart failure (CHF), with the use of controls (C), respectively. (Mean values+/-SD) 29 HTR 4.4 +/- 2.1 years after transplantation, 29 CHF (NYHA II n = 22, III n = 7) and 29 C (age 54 +/- 9, 61 +/- 10, 56 +/- 10 years, body mass index 28 +/- 3, 29 +/- 5, 28 +/- 4 kg x m(-2), body fat 25 +/- 4, 27 +/- 6, 26 +/- 5%, respectively) performed cardiopulmonary exercise testing and were interviewed with the standardized German "Quality of life profile for chronic diseases" questionnaire. Peak oxygen consumption was impaired in HTR and in CHF compared with C (19.0 +/- 4.5, 18.6 +/- 4.3, and 30.2 +/- 6.6 ml x min x kg(-1), respectively; p < 0.01 vs. C each). HTR and CHF patients' quality of life in the physical scores were both impaired (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 vs. C, respectively), but HTRs have reported better scores than CHF (p < 0.05). In the psychological role, CHF was impaired against C (p < 0.05), and HTR scores were comparable with C. In social functioning HTR and CHF patients both showed reduced quality of life dimensions. The Pearson correlation analysis showed that quality of life in physical functioning was related to peak oxygen consumption (p < 0.001) and percentage of predicted workload (p < 0.001). Quality of life in the social and psychological domains showed no association to exercise-related values. In HTR and in CHF, exercise testing variables were dominant predictors among the physical scales in quality of life, but not among social or psychological scales. Therefore, even late after heart transplantation, improving physical capacity should be a therapeutic goal with the intention of further increasing the quality of life.
