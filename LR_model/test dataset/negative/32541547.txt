Postoperative Psychological Disorders Among Heart Transplant Recipients: A Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression. This meta-analysis evaluates the pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among heart transplant recipients globally and determines underlying moderators. The authors searched PubMed, Embase, PsychINFO, BIOSIS, Science Direct, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases from inception to March 1, 2019, and 1321 records and 42 full-text articles were selected and reviewed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We calculated the pooled prevalence proportion of depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, and PTSD using random-effects models. Meta-regression was performed to identify important moderators that contribute to heterogeneity. Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria and comprised 2169 patients. The pooled prevalence of depression was 21.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 16.8%-27.3%), anxiety 11.1% (95% CI = 3.8%-28.5%), adjustment disorder 11.0% (95% CI = 3.1%-32.1%), and PTSD 13.5% (95% CI = 8%-21.8%). There was significant heterogeneity. Meta-regression was conducted to account for the heterogeneity of the prevalence proportion. Predisposing factors, for example, New York Heart Association classes II and III/IV, steroid treatment, and acute rejection of transplant (<3 months), were associated with high prevalence of depression. Protective factors, for example, age and higher ejection fraction after transplant of patients, were associated with low prevalence of depression. Female sex, single status, and number of months since transplant were associated with high prevalence of anxiety. Single status was associated with high prevalence of both adjustment disorder and transplant-related PTSD. The prevalence of psychiatric conditions, particularly depression, is high in heart transplant recipients. The identified protective and risk factors may guide psychological interventions in heart transplant recipients.
