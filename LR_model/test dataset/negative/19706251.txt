Reversal of protein-losing enteropathy after heart transplantation in young patients. Protein-losing enteropathy is a rare but life-threatening complication that occurs in some patients who develop intestinal lymphangiectasis secondary to increased systemic venous pressure. Although different forms of treatment have been tried, with varying results, the majority were reported to be unsuccessful. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that heart transplantation may be an appropriate therapeutic option for patients who do not respond to medical treatment. At our center, we performed heart transplantations in three patients with this condition. The mean follow-up period was 11+/-2 months. No patient died and the enteropathy regressed in all three.
