Mechanical Postconditioning Promotes Glucose Metabolism and AMPK Activity in Parallel with Improved Post-Ischemic Recovery in an Isolated Rat Heart Model of Donation after Circulatory Death. Donation after circulatory death (DCD) could improve donor heart availability; however, warm ischemia-reperfusion injury raises concerns about graft quality. Mechanical postconditioning (MPC) may limit injury, but mechanisms remain incompletely characterized. Therefore, we investigated the roles of glucose metabolism and key signaling molecules in MPC using an isolated rat heart model of DCD. Hearts underwent 20 minutes perfusion, 30 minutes global ischemia, and 60 minutes reperfusion with or without MPC (two cycles: 30 seconds reperfusion-30 seconds ischemia). Despite identical perfusion conditions, MPC either significantly decreased (low recovery = LoR; 32 Â± 5%;  'cardiac ischemia reperfusion injury', 'contractile function', 'donation after circulatory death', 'glucose metabolism', 'postconditioning'
