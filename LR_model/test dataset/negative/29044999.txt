Macrophage subpopulations and their impact on chronic allograft rejection versus graft acceptance in a mouse heart transplant model. Macrophages infiltrating the allografts are heterogeneous, consisting of proinflammatory (M1 cells) as well as antiinflammatory and fibrogenic phenotypes (M2 cells); they affect transplantation outcomes via diverse mechanisms. Here we found that macrophage polarization into M1 and M2 subsets was critically dependent on tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), respectively. In a heart transplant model we showed that macrophage-specific deletion of TRAF6 (LysM 'basic (laboratory) research/science', 'heart (allograft) function/dysfunction', 'heart transplantation/cardiology', 'macrophage/monocyte biology: differentiation/maturation', 'rejection: chronic', 'vasculopathy'
