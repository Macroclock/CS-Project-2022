Cyclosporin-induced gingival overgrowth in a child treated with CO2 laser surgery: a case report. A case of a 10 year-old boy with gingival overgrowth due to cyclosporin therapy after heart transplantation is described. Different treatment approaches are discussed and the surgical effect of CO2 laser is illustrated. The critical role of routine professional cleaning and good oral health maintenance for the healthy status of the gingival tissue is also emphasized in this paper. Replacement of cyclosporin by tacrolimus, another immunosuppressive agent associated with minimal to none gingival overgrowth, might be considered in cases with reported recurrences.
