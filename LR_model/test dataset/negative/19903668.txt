Intrinsic neural reflexes in the post-transplant human heart. Radiofrequency ablation of post-transplant flutter in a centrally denervated donor atrium at a site remote from the AV node resulted in transient worsening of AV nodal conduction, with absent central vagal reinnervation. This could be an electrophysiological marker of intact innervation to the donor AV node from the intrinsic cardiac neuronal plexus, not demonstrated in human hearts earlier.
