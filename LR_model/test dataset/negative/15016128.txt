Relationship between endomyocardial biopsy score and cyclosporine 2-h post-dose levels (C) in heart transplant patients receiving anti-thymocyte globulin induction. Cyclosporine (CsA) 2-h post-dose levels (C(2)) correlate better with the area-under-the-curve compared with trough levels. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between C(2) and endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) score in heart transplant patients receiving anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)-induction. We reviewed 517 EMB performed during the first year in 39 adult heart transplant patients receiving ATG-induction, corticosteroids, mycophenolate mofetil and CsA. C(2) obtained on the day of EMB was related to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation classification (score </=2 or >/=3A). Furthermore, EMB were related to C(2) (ng/mL), sorted according to the lower recommended range in liver (0-3 months: 850; 4-6 months: 700; 7-12 months: 500) or renal transplantation (0-1 month: 1500; 2-3 months: 1200; 4-6 months: 1000; 7-12 months: 800). Overall, C(2) did not significantly differ in patients with EMB </=2 or >/=3A. However, during the first month, EMB </=2 was associated with a trend towards a higher mean C(2) compared with EMB >/=3A (750 ng/mL vs. 530 ng/mL). When C(2) were sorted according to the lower recommended range in liver or renal transplantation, no significant difference was observed when EMB was </=2 or >/=3A. In heart transplant patients receiving ATG-induction, C(2) did not significantly differ according to EMB </=2 or >/=3A. No significant relationship was found between EMB score and C(2) based on the lower recommended range in liver or renal transplantation. However, mean C(2) >750 ng/mL appears to be associated with a lower rejection score during the first month.
