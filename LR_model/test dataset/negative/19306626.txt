[Current understanding of new standards of patient care in cardiovascular anesthesia: preface and comments]. The search to define new standards of patient care is of particular relevance for the anesthesiologists providing cardiovascular anesthesia. Because of conflicting results on multiple issues, however, it is often difficult to understand new standards of patient care especially for occasional cardiovascular anesthesiologists. The objective of this series of articles is to summarize evidence of clinical and basic research and introduce current understanding of new standards of patient care in cardiovascular anesthesia. The following topics are discussed in each article: use of cardiovascular drugs for cardiac surgery, myocardial preconditioning in anesthesia, hemostatic management for cardiac surgical patients, blood glucose control during cardiac surgery, cognitive dysfunction after cardiac surgery, spinal protection in aortic surgery, ventricular assist device and heart transplantation in Japan. Further investigations in this area are critical in order to provide optimal patient care.
