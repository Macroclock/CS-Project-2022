Clinical care of nursing reasoned in Parse: contribution in the transcendence process of cardiac transplantation. To identify how the clinical and educational nursing care based on the Theory of Human Becoming can contribute to the transcendence process of heart transplant patients in pursuit of good living. Research-intervention developed with four heart transplant patients linked to a reference transplant hospital in Ceara. Data was collected through interviews in 2014 and analyzed using Parse's theoretical framework and pertinent literature. Transplant patients revealed they gave living in such condition an ambiguous meaning, showing satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Dietary restrictions, difficulties with medication and curiosity about the transplant were identified as disharmonies involving the process. Care was developed focused on educating the transplant patients, approaching the themes healthy eating, organ rejection, immunosuppressant use and facts about heart transplantation. Educative care based on Parse favors the decision-making and autonomy of individuals regarding their health, contributing to transcendence in pursuit of good living.
