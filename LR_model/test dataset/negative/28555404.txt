Abnormal Myocardial Contractility After Pediatric Heart Transplantation by Cardiac MRI. Acute cellular rejection (ACR) compromises graft function after heart transplantation (HTX). The purpose of this study was to describe systolic myocardial deformation in pediatric HTX and to determine whether it is impaired during ACR. Eighteen combined cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR)/endomyocardial biopsy (EMBx) examinations were performed in 14 HTX patients (11 male, age 13.9 ± 4.7 years; 1.2 ± 1.3 years after HTX). Biventricular function and left ventricular (LV) circumferential strain, rotation, and torsion by myocardial tagging CMR were compared to 11 controls as well as between patients with and without clinically significant ACR. HTX patients showed mildly reduced biventricular systolic function when compared to controls [LV ejection fraction (EF): 55 ± 8% vs. 61 ± 3, p = 0.02; right ventricular (RV) EF: 48 ± 7% vs. 53 ± 6, p = 0.04]. Indexed LV mass was mildly increased in HTX patients (67 ± 14 g/m 'Acute cellular rejection', 'Heart transplant', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Myocardial deformation', 'Pediatric'
