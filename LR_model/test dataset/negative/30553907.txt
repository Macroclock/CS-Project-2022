Emerging Trends in Financing of Adult Heart Transplantation in the United States. This study examined longitudinal trends in types of payers for adult heart transplantations in the United States. In the last decade, volume of heart transplantations in the United States has substantially increased, a trend that has coincided with Medicaid expansion and greater insurance coverage in the general U.S. Limited data are available characterizing the changes in payer mix supporting these recent increases in heart transplantation activity. De-identified data were obtained from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network for heart transplantation recipients 18 to 64 years of age in the United States between 1997 and 2017. Primary sources of insurance payment were determined at the time of transplantation in aggregate and stratified by sex and race. Changes in volume and payer mix of patients added to the candidate waitlist between 1997 and 2017 were also examined. A total of 36,340 adults from 18 to 64 years of age underwent heart transplantations between 1997 and 2017. Support by public payer insurance increased from 28.2% (in 1997) to a peak of 48.8% (in 2016). Medicaid coverage increased from 9.4% in 1997 to 15.5% in 2007 and remained stable to 2017 (14.7%; β-coefficient: +0.23% [0.04]; p < 0.001 for trend). Medicare beneficiaries accounted for 18.2% of recipients in 1997, 22% in 2007, and 30.3% in 2016 (β-coefficient: +0.60% [0.06]; p < 0.001 for trend). The proportion of transplantation candidates receiving Medicare coverage increased over time across all races and both sexes. Similar aggregate patterns were observed in waitlist trends for adult heart transplantation candidates. Public payer insurance has emerged as an increasingly dominant source of funding for adult heart transplantations in the United States, supporting nearly half of all transplants in 2017.
