Impairment of the ER/mitochondria compartment in human cardiomyocytes with PLN p.Arg14del mutation. The phospholamban (PLN) p.Arg14del mutation causes dilated cardiomyopathy, with the molecular disease mechanisms incompletely understood. Patient dermal fibroblasts were reprogrammed to hiPSC, isogenic controls were established by CRISPR/Cas9, and cardiomyocytes were differentiated. Mutant cardiomyocytes revealed significantly prolonged Ca 'endoplasmic reticulum', 'engineered heart tissue', 'human-induced pluripotent stem cells', 'mitochondria', 'phospholamban p.Arg14del'
