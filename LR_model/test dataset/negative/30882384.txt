Rothia mucilaginosa bacteremia in end-stage renal disease and solid organ transplant: the need for raised awareness. Rothia mucilaginosa, previously known as Stomatococcus mucilaginosus, is a Gram-positive coccus that is a part of the oropharyngeal and upper respiratory tract microbiota. Although this organism is believed to be of low virulence, it is increasingly being recognized as an opportunistic pathogen mostly affecting immunocompromised hosts. In this article, we describe a case of Rothia mucilaginosa bacteremia in an immunocompromised heart transplant recipient with end-stage renal disease, who was getting maintenance hemodialysis via a tunneled catheter. To the best of our knowledge, no cases of Rothia mucilaginosa bacteremia have been reported previously in heart transplant patients.
