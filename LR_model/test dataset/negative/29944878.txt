Isolated Severe Right Ventricular Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. A 26-year-old woman with a diagnosis of congenital heart disease was admitted to the hospital with exertional dyspnea, cyanotic complexion, and bilateral lower limb edema. All tests revealed isolated severe right ventricular hypertrophy. She was in poor condition, with a diminishing chance for routine surgical treatment, so she was scheduled for orthotopic homologous heart transplantation. After the operation, isolated severe right ventricular hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was confirmed histologically and pathologically. After the operation, the patient's cardiac function was normal. Exertional dyspnea, cyanotic complexion, and bilateral lower limb edema all improved postoperatively.
