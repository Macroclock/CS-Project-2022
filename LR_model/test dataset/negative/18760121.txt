Treatment of chronic systolic heart failure secondary to Chagas heart disease in the current era of heart failure therapy. The treatment of chronic heart failure secondary to Chagas disease has been based on extrapolation of data achieved in the treatment of non-Chagas disease heart failure. Because beta-blockers decrease the incidence of sudden cardiac death in non-Chagas disease heart failure and sudden cardiac death occurs preferentially in patients with mild Chagas disease heart failure, beta-blockers may be administered first to class I/II patients with Chagas disease heart failure. In advanced Chagas disease heart failure, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and diuretics may be given at first to compensate for congestive symptoms. After clinical status improvement, beta-blockers should be given at targeted doses, if necessary reducing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor doses. Primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death may be accomplished with implantable cardioverter defibrillators because of the high recurrence of life-threatening arrhythmias despite amiodarone administration. In refractory heart failure, heart transplantation is the treatment of choice.
