Pyogenic psoas abscess: a rare complication after orthotopic heart transplantation. We describe a 57-year-old man who developed a primary psoas abscess after treatment for acute allograft rejection, 5 years after orthotopic heart transplantation. The infective organism was methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and the patient underwent successful treatment with computed tomography-guided percutaneous drainage combined with teicoplanin and fusidic acid.
