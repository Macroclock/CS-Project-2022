A Complex Heart Team's Approach to a Patient With Giant Cell Myocarditis. Giant cell myocarditis is known as a rare and frequently fatal type of myocarditis that is usually characterized by progressive congestive heart failure and frequent ventricular arrhythmias. We report a rare case of giant cell myocarditis in a 64-year-old previously healthy woman. The case was complicated by the rapid development of progressive acute heart failure, which required the comprehensive care of our heart team. Using a broad spectrum of therapeutic approaches, the patient successfully underwent heart transplantation.
