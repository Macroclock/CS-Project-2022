Impact of Circulatory Assistance in the Early Evolution After Heart Transplantation. Unicentric Experience. Heart transplantation (HT) is the reference treatment for patients with terminal heart failure. In recent years there has been a progressive increase in HT procedures in patients who have a circulatory support (CS). This is a retrospective single-center study of 293 consecutive patients who underwent HT from 2009 to 2018, analyzing the evolution of the 2 cohorts: patients with and without CS as a bridge to HT. Baseline and evolutionary clinical data collected following the usual follow-up protocol were recorded, including clinical events observed during the follow-up 1 year after the procedure. The subgroup of patients transplanted with CS showed a higher incidence of primary graft failure, frequent infection, and mortality. A tendency toward lower cardiac allograft vasculopathy was observed in this subgroup. Mechanical ventilation added to the CS resulted in a higher incidence of primary graft failure, infection, and renal dysfunction. The CS variable as a bridge to HT was shown to be predictive of 1-year mortality in both univariate (odds ratio, 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-3.3; P = .038) and multivariate (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-4.3; P = .047) analyses. In our experience, CS as a bridge to HT results in a higher incidence of primary graft failure, frequent infection, and mortality at 1-year follow-up. Mechanical ventilation added to CS has a clear unfavorable prognostic impact. CS as a bridge to HT was shown to be predictive of 1-year mortality in both univariate and multivariate analyses.
