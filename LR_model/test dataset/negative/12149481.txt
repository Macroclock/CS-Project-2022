Immunosuppressive effects of tautomycetin in vivo and in vitro via T cell-specific apoptosis induction. Tautomycetin (TMC) was identified as an immunosuppressor of activated T cells. Inhibition of T cell proliferation with TMC was observed at concentrations 100-fold lower than those needed to achieve maximal inhibition with cyclosporin A (CsA). TMC specifically blocked tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular signal mediators downstream of Src tyrosine kinases in a T cell-specific manner, leading to apoptosis due to cleavage of Bcl-2, caspase-9, caspase-3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, but not caspase-1. In TMC-treated rats that received a heterotopic cardiac allograft, the graft survived more than 160 days, comparable to graft survival in allografted rats treated with CsA. Thus, TMC, whose mechanism of action is different from that of CsA or FK506, can be used as a potent T cell-specific immunosuppressor.
