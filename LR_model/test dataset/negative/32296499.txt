Population pharmacokinetic analysis of tacrolimus in Chinese cardiac transplant recipients. Usage of tacrolimus is complicated by its narrow therapeutic index and wide between- and within-subject pharmacokinetic variability. We aimed to obtain more information regarding the influence of various covariates on the disposition of tacrolimus in the early phase after cardiac transplantation using a population pharmacokinetic method, and provide information for the individualisation of drug dosing in the clinical setting. Routine therapeutic drug monitoring concentrations (897 observations) were retrospectively collected from 146 hospitalised patients. One compartment model with first-order absorption (absorption rate constant K Pharmacokinetic parameter population typical estimates for clearance (CL/F) and apparent distribution volume (V/F) were 14.23 L/hour and 760.80 L, respectively. Postoperative day and co-administration of Wuzhi capsules were identified as important factors affecting CL/F. Total body weight was significantly associated with the V/F. Results of model evaluation indicated a good stable and precise performance of the final model. Based on the simulation results, a simple-touse dosage regimen table to guide clinicians with drug dosing was created. The final population model could provide information for the individualised dosing of tacrolimus for cardiac transplant recipients.
