Orthotopic heart transplant in a pediatric patient with mixed connective tissue disease. Patients with autoimmune inflammatory syndromes such as mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) and systemic lupus erythematosus have previously been considered marginal candidates for orthotopic heart transplant (OHT). A retrospective chart review was completed for this case report. We present the case of an 11-year-old girl with known MCTD who developed congestive heart failure refractory to medical therapy and underwent OHT. Despite her autoimmune condition, this patient has not experienced antibody-mediated rejection post-transplant and her inflammatory symptoms have greatly improved.
