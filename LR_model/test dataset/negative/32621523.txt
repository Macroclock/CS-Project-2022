A proposed strategy for management of immunosuppression in heart transplant patients with COVID-19. There is limited experience in management of orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) patients with COVID-19. In this study, we present our initial experience using a standardized management algorithm. Data collection was performed on OHT patients with COVID-19 after March 10, 2020 (declaration of state of emergency in Massachusetts). Among the 358 OHT patients currently followed at our program, 5 patients (1.4%) tested positive for COVID-19 (median age 50 years [IQR, 49-58], duration post-OHT 21 years [IQR, 6-25], and 4 of 5 [80%] were men). Among the 5 OHT patients, 2 of 5 (20%) had mild disease and had no change in baseline immunosuppression therapy. Two of 5 (20%) had moderate disease and received remdesivir as part of a clinical trial and reduced immunosuppression therapy. One patient (20%) died prior to presenting to the hospital, consistent with 20% case fatality rate. Four patients (80%) are doing well 4 weeks post-discharge. In this small cohort of OHT patients with COVID-19, we report a 1.4% COVID-19 infection rate and 20% case fatality rate. All OHT patients managed under our clinical management algorithm had good short-term outcomes. Further study to estimate the true risk profile of OHT patients and validate the proposed management strategy is warranted. 'COVID-19', 'heart transplantation', 'immunosuppression'
