Genetic variants identified by target next-generation sequencing in heart transplant patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a myocardial disease that can progress to a terminal stage, requiring heart transplantation. In this work we aim to contribute to knowledge of genetic variants in adult patients undergoing heart transplantation due to end-stage DCM, reporting the results obtained in our single-center tertiary hospital series using target next-generation sequencing (NGS). Genetic variants were screened in 15 genes, preselected based on variants previously identified in DCM patients. Thirteen unrelated patients were included, nine (69%) male, mean age at diagnosis 33±13 years, eight (62%) with familial DCM. Nine genetic variants were identified in six (46%) patients: five in LMNA, two in LBD3, one in TNNT2 and one in TCAP. These variants were new in most patients. The majority were classified as of uncertain significance. Two patients were double and triple heterozygotes in the LBD3 and LMNA genes, respectively. Our results highlight the potential of NGS in the genetic characterization of DCM patients. LMNA is one of the most frequently mutated genes and should be included in all target gene assessments of end-stage DCM patients until more data are available.
