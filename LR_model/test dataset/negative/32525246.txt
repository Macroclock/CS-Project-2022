Comparison of tissue Doppler imaging and conventional echocardiography to discriminate rejection from non-rejection after pediatric heart transplantation. TDI is considered superior to conventional echocardiography for detecting changes in graft function during rejection in adults but has not demonstrated after pediatric OHT. We retrospectively analyzed echocardiograms performed within 24 hours of biopsy in 122 recipients with median age of 8.7 years. Using biopsy findings as the gold standard, we compared paired rejection and non-rejection echocardiograms using each patient as their own control. We included pairs of LV dimensions, FS, volumes, mass, mass/volume, sphericity, wall stress, SSI, SVI, and TDI velocities in this comparison. C-statistic was used to assess discrimination for individual echo variables and combinations of variables. Overall, 647 non-rejection and 24 rejection biopsy-echo pairs were identified. There was a significant decline in TDI velocities and their Z-scores during rejection but not in conventional variables (P ≤ .005). The variable that best discriminated rejection from non-rejection was LV S', with C-statistic = 0.93. Conventional echo variables performed less well with C-statistic range 0.65-0.67 for LV EF, shortening fraction, and mass. TDI is superior to conventional echocardiography measures for discriminating rejection from non-rejection. The use of newer non-invasive parameters to detect myocardial dysfunction and shifting the paradigm of rejection surveillance to detection of non-rejection together provide a promising approach to reducing the need for biopsy in pediatric heart recipients.
