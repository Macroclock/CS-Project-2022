The most common complications of this device are mediastinal bleeding, infections, embolic events, right-sided heart failure, and mediastinal adhesions. We are reporting a patient who had a Levitronix left ventricular assist device implanted with mini-pericardiotomy technique for bridging to heart transplant.
