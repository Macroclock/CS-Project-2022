Study on the preservation with CO (PCO = 200-2,000 hPa), resuscitation, and heterotopic transplantation of an isolated rat heart. In this experiment, CO was used as a gas mixture in a reversible relationship with O(2). CO was added in a gas form mixed with O(2). An isolated donor rat heart was obtained, exposed to a gas mixture such as PO(2) = 1,800 hPa and PCO = 200 hPa, and PO(2) = 1,000 hPa and PCO = 1,000 hPa in a 2 ATA high-pressure chamber and preserved in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C. This report demonstrates that significant reproducibility has been verified. The heart was removed from the refrigerator 24 h later and heterotopic heart transplantation was performed in the right neck of a recipient rat and the pulsating of the transplanted heart was detected by an electrocardiogram.
