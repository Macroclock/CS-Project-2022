Relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters of cyclosporin and the incidence of acute rejection after heart transplantation. Despite two decades of use, there are limited data on the best way to monitor Cyclosporine (CsA) for heart transplantation. The aim of our study was to determine the relationships between pharmacokinetic parameters and clinical outcomes after heart transplantation and to evaluate the range of CsA trough levels provided the most effective protection against graft rejection. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical outcomes of all adult patients who received a heart transplant between January 1998 and February 2005. All had routine monitoring of CsA trough levels and scheduled endomyocardial biopsies. Rejection was defined as grade > or =3, based on International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) criteria. Follow-up period was 1 year. All patients were on CsA, corticosteroids, and azathioprine/mycophenolate mofetil with or without antilymphocyte induction (eight patients with basiliximab). Data were analyzed by unpaired Student t-test, Cox regression model, and ROC curve. Among 70 patients (60 men and 10 women) who entered the study, 34 (48.6%) had at least one acute rejection episode of grade > or =3 during the first posttransplant year. Mean CsA trough level (C(0)) measured at first week posttransplant was significantly lower in the rejection than the no-rejection group (125.17 +/- 56.9 ng/mL versus 169.33 +/- 48.27 ng/mL, P = .001). C(0) was the strongest predictor of acute graft rejection (P = .000, HR = .985.) The risk decreased by 1.5% for each unit increase of the C(0) value. ROC analysis showed that C(0) of 150 ng/mL provided the optimal cutoff. Patients with mean C(0) >150 ng/mL over the first week had less incidence of acute rejection than patients with levels <150 ng/mL (30.3% versus 64.9%) (P = .009, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test). In conclusion, our data suggest that in heart transplant patients it may be crucial to target early trough levels above 150 ng/mL during the first days postsurgery to avoid rejection.
