Prolonged Mouse Cardiac Graft Cold Storage via Attenuating Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury Using a New Antioxidant-Based Preservation Solution. One of the major events in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced heart injury in cardiac transplantation is the generation of reactive oxygen species. We hypothesized that a novel preservation solution called SBI-SEIIKU II (SS-II) contains 3 antioxidant reagents: L-cysteine, glycine, ascorbic acid/ascorbic acid-2-phosphate magnesium, which can block the generation of reactive oxygen species to result in a prolongation of the cold storage time via attenuating I/R injury. C57BL/6CrSlc(B6) mice underwent syngeneic mice heterotopic heart transplantation, and the animals were derived into 3 groups: recipients with nonpreserved grafts (control group), recipients with grafts preserved in histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) for 24 and 48 hours (HTK group), and recipients with grafts preserved in SS-II for 24 and 48 hours (SS-II group). After 48 hours of preservation, there were no grafts that survived in the HTK group; however, the SS-II group had a high survival rate. After 24 hours of preservation, SS-II decreased the oxidative damage, myocardial apoptosis, and the infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils in the cardiac grafts in the early phase and suppressed the development of myocardial fibrosis in long-term grafts compared with HTK. The SS-II prolongs the acceptable cold storage time and protects the myocardium from I/R injury via inhibiting oxidative stress-associated damage. We believe that this novel preservation solution may be simple and safe for use in the clinical transplantation field.
