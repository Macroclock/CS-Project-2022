[Specialized care program for end-stage heart failure patients. Initial experience in a heart failure unit]. End-stage heart failure is associated with very high morbidity and mortality. Palliative care has been little studied in affected patients. Between January 1998 and December 2004, 61 patients with end-stage heart failure participated in a specialized advanced heart failure care program. The program included patient education on advanced heart failure, with day-care and home-care elements, and involved intravenous drug administration when necessary. The mean age of the study population was 64 (13) years (range 32-87 years), with 92% being male. Their mean ejection fraction was 23 (6%), mean systolic blood pressure 100 (16) mm Hg, mean blood sodium level 137 (4) mEq, mean creatinine level 1.7 (0.8) mg/dL, and mean hemoglobin level 12 (2) mg/dL. The number of hospitalizations, number of days in hospital per admission, and number of emergency room visits in the year before inclusion in the specialized heart failure care program were 5.7 (0.5), 53 (5), and 8.3 (1.1), respectively. After inclusion, these figures decreased significantly to 1.9 (0.2) (P=.0001), 19 (3) (P=.0001), and 1.2 (0.2) (P=.0001), respectively. During a mean follow-up period of 11 (10) months, 28 patients died (47%) and 23 (38%) underwent heart transplantation. In addition, use of the program led to a reduction in healthcare costs. Although mortality in end-stage heart failure patients remained very high, use of a specialized advanced heart failure care program decreased the number of hospitalizations, days per hospitalization, and emergency room visits, and reduced the cost of care.
