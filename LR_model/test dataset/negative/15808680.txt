Mean xenograft survival of 14.6 days in a small group of hDAF-transgenic pig hearts transplanted orthotopically into baboons. In a discordant orthotopic xenotransplantation model (pig-to-baboon) donor pigs expressing human decay accelerating factor (hDAF) as a regulator of complement activity were used to prevent hyperacute xenograft rejection (HXR). We investigated a modified immunosuppressive therapy consisting of ERL080 (Novartis Pharma AG, Base, Switzerland), cyclosporin A (Neoral), steroids, and a cyclophosphamide (CyP) induction protocol with several reduced doses to prevent acute vascular rejection (AVR). Donor hearts were harvested from hDAF-transgenic pigs (18.8 +/- 2.6 kg, Imutran Ltd., a Novartis Pharma AG Company). Four adult baboons (25.6 +/- 2.7 kg) with high titers of xenoreactive antibodies (XAb) served as recipients. Serological and hemodynamic parameters were measured. Finally, myocardial tissue was sampled for histological and immunohistochemical examinations. In the first baboon, an acute graft failure occurred after 1 hour due to preservation injury. The second succumbed after 11.1 day due to an acute renal failure. The third died after 13.1 days of an ileus. The fourth baboon had continuously excellent cardiac function (mean echocardiographic ejection fraction, 69.2%), but succumbed on day 20 due to anemia. Corrected mean xenograft survival (excluding the first baboon because of a technical failure) was 14.6 +/- 2.6 days. XAb decreased after day 3 to constantly low levels (<1:64 titer) after CyP induction. White blood cell count decreased from 10.3 +/- 0.8 to 0.9 +/- 0.3 G/L after day 3. Macroscopically and histologically no typical signs of HXR or severe AVR could be detected. These results confirm that hDAF transgen blocks HXR in this life-supporting model. AVR was prevented by using a modified quadruple immunosuppressive drug combination (Neoral, ERL080, steroids, and several small single doses of CyP). An optimum "fine-tuning" of immunosuppression is required to achieve the best risk-benefit ratio.
