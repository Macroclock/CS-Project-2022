Uric acid is an independent predictor of cardiac allograft vasculopathy after heart transplantation. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a major complication after heart transplantation (HT). Uric acid (UA) may play a role in CAV due to its role in stimulating T-cell-mediated immunity. Sirolimus is associated with CAV attenuation through a number of mechanisms, including immune-mediated effects. We aimed to determine whether UA is an independent predictor of CAV and whether conversion to sirolimus as primary immunosuppression modulates UA levels. We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 224 patients who underwent HT between 2004 and 2015 and had serial coronary intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) studies. Serum UA levels were measured at baseline and last follow-up IVUS in all participants. CAV progression was assessed by measuring the change in plaque volume (ΔPV) and plaque index (ratio of plaque volume to vessel volume [ΔPI]) between last follow-up and baseline IVUS after correction for time of follow-up. Patients with high (≥7 mg/dl) compared with low (<7 mg/dl) UA had increased median ΔPV (0.33 [interquartile range 0.08 to 0.93] vs 0.07 [-0.17 to 0.38] mm UA is an independent predictor of CAV after HT. Sirolimus is associated with decreased UA levels and may explain one of the mechanisms by which sirolimus attenuates CAV progression.
