The 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Working Formulation for the standardization of nomenclature in the pathologic diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection in heart transplantation. During the last 25 years, antibody-mediated rejection of the cardiac allograft has evolved from a relatively obscure concept to a recognized clinical complication in the management of heart transplant patients. Herein we report the consensus findings from a series of meetings held between 2010-2012 to develop a Working Formulation for the pathologic diagnosis, grading, and reporting of cardiac antibody-mediated rejection. The diagnostic criteria for its morphologic and immunopathologic components are enumerated, illustrated, and described in detail. Numerous challenges and unresolved clinical, immunologic, and pathologic questions remain to which a Working Formulation may facilitate answers.  'activated mononuclear cells', 'antibody mediated rejection', 'complement', 'heart', 'immunofluorescence', 'immunohistochemistry', 'intravascular'
