Cutaneous and muscular microcirculation in patients with terminal heart failure awaiting transplantation. Heart failure patients are clinically characterized by extreme cardiomegaly, breathlessness, fluid retention and an early onset of fatigue. Studies have shown generalized restricted blood flow in those patients. Furthermore animal experiments proved an impaired blood flow and a diminished oxygen supply of the skeletal muscle in animals with chronic heart failure. Patients with chronic heart failure are limited to the extent of their ability to regulate their arterial pressure, especially in physical activity. It is however unclear in what way restriction of blood flow in the main arteries correlates with those in capillaries and to what extent. In this study it was examined the depth of capillary circulatory restriction as well as the disregulation of oxygen partial pressure in skeletal muscle in rest and stress conditions, in patients with terminal heart failure.
