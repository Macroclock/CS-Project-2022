Predictors of Renal Failure in Patients Treated With the Total Artificial Heart. The incidence of hemodialysis (HD)-dependent renal failure after total artificial heart (TAH) implantation is high. We sought to determine the preoperative predictors of HD after TAH implantation. We studied 87 patients after TAH implantation at our institution between April 2006 and March 2017. Baseline clinical data were obtained from the medical records, and patients were followed until death or heart transplantation. We performed logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of HD after TAH implantation. Of the patients, 24 (28%) required postimplantation HD. Those requiring HD were more likely to have histories of coronary artery disease (58% vs 29%; P = 0.01), required preoperative membrane oxygenation (33% vs 4.8%; P = 0.001) and had lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rates (54 ± 29 vs 67 ± 24 mL/min/1.73m The incidence of postimplantation HD is high and is associated with increased likelihood of mortality. Lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rates, histories of coronary artery disease and preoperative membrane oxygenation support are predictors of postimplantation requirement of HD. These data may help to identify patients at risk for adverse outcomes after TAH implantation. 'Mechanical circulatory support', 'dialysis', 'heart failure', 'renal disease'
