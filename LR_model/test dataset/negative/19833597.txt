Long-term mechanical support for complex left ventricular postinfarct pseudoaneurysms. Left ventricular free wall rupture can be a catastrophic problem. Although small lacerations can be managed with various techniques of primary closure, larger and more complex defects can be difficult to treat. We present and discuss 2 cases of chronic, complex ventricular pseudoaneurysms managed successfully with long-term mechanical support.
