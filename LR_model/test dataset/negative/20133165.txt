Paracorporeal biventricular mechanical circulatory support for more than 4 years. We present a patient who was evaluated for heart transplantation, but because of acute cardiac decompensation with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and multiorgan failure, had the indication for biventricular mechanical circulatory support. The patient was maintained on mechanical circulatory support for more than 4 years until he became eligible to receive a heart allograft.
