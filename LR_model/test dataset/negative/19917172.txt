Coexistence of oligo-articular gout and Mycobacterium kansasii joint and bursal infection in a patient with an orthotopic heart transplant. Mycobacterium kansasii septic arthritis is rare, most often occurring in immunosuppressed patients including those with organ transplants. We present a case of oligoarticular M. kansasii infection in bilateral ankles, knee, and bilateral olecranon bursae in coexistence with tophaceous gouty arthropathy in a heart transplant patient. There are no reports of M. kansasii infection occurring in joints also affected by tophaceous gout. We contend that gouty arthropathy may alter the joint in such a way as to increase the risk of development of this infection in patients already at risk. In transplant patients presenting with a history and pattern of arthritis consistent with gout, a sufficient level of suspicion should be maintained for this infectious complication, even if monosodium urate crystals are seen on joint aspiration.
