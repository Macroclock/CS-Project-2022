[Late thrombosis of a drug-eluting coronary stent after antiplatelet therapy discontinuation]. We reported the late thrombosis of a drug-eluting coronary stent related to discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy for venous surgery of the right leg more than half and a year after its implantation. After this acute myocardial infarction, a cardiac assistance device has to be used as a bridge to transplantation because of end stage ischaemic cardiopathy. Antiplatelet therapy management must be revisited for eluting stents, which can clot lately after its implantation.
