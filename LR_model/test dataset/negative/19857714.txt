Cytomegalovirus infection does not accelerate microvasculopathy development in heart transplant recipients. Clinical studies with intravascular ultrasound have suggested that even subclinical cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections increase intimal hyperplasia in transplanted heart coronary arteries after 1 year. The potential influence of CMV on microvasculopathy development is not known. The Aim of our study was to compare the occurrence of microvasulopathy in endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) of heart transplant recipients with versus without CMV infection. We performed a case-controlled, retrospective study of 58 subjects diagnosed with CMV infection by the presence of pp65 antigen. The 49 men and 91 women of overall age 49 +/- 8 years showed ischemic cardiomyopathy in 52%. We matched a control cohort of 58 subjects without CMV disease. Microvasculopathy was assessed using 4-degree grading system developed by Hiemann et al for elective EMBs performed at 1 and 12 months after transplantation. Significant acute rejection episodes were observed among 22% versus 21% of 1-month EMBs, and 3% versus 5% of 12-month EMBs for CMV(+) versus control group subjects respectively. The commonest microvasculopathy was nonstenotic thickening (grade B) 60% versus 59% (35 versus 34 patients) among 1-month EMBs; and 50% versus 60% (29 vs 35 patients) among 12-month EMBs, respectively. Progression of microvasculopathy score between 1- and 12-month EMB was observed in 40% versus 41% of subjects, and regression occurred in 22% versus 21%, respectively. None of differences was significant. Our data do not support the thesis that CMV infection promotes microvasculopathy development among heart transplant recipients.
