Sideroblastic anemia due to linezolid in a patient with a left ventricular assist device. An acquired form of sideroblastic anemia has been described in association with several drugs, especially anti-microbial agents. A case of sideroblastic anemia is presented in a patient with a left ventricular assist device drive-line infection who was receiving linezolid, an antibiotic used for serious infections with gram-positive organisms. This patient's anemia resolved after discontinuation of the drug; he subsequently underwent an uncomplicated orthotopic heart transplant with no recurrence of anemia. As linezolid has been shown to have hematologic side effects, blood count monitoring is recommended in patients receiving this drug for long-term therapy.
