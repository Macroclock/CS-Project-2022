Adult and pediatric perspectives on heart retransplant. At the Ethics of the Heart II: Ethical and Policy Challenges in Congenital Heart Disease Conference, March 16-17, 2012 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, one of the sessions focused on the issues related to end-stage heart failure in patients with congenital heart disease including utilizing the therapy of heart transplantation. This article will summarize the session related to repeat heart transplant that was based on discussion of actual patient cases, two adults and one pediatric, presented, respectively, by an adult and a pediatric heart transplant specialist. Outcome data related to retransplant for both adult and pediatric heart transplant populations are reviewed. The complicated ethical issues related to considerations of beneficence versus nonmalfeasance by a medical care team for an individual patient, patient autonomy related to adherence, and obligations to society to fairly allocate the scarce precious resource of donor organs are discussed.
