Inhibition of nitrosylation, nitration, lymphocyte proliferation, and gene expression in acute and delayed cardiac allograft rejection by an orally active dithiocarbamate. Dithiocarbamate derivatives sequester metals such as iron and may have benefits in inflammatory diseases. We examined the actions of a new dithiocarbamate-based oral formulation, NOX-700, on protein modification by nitric oxide (NO), gene expression, and lymphocyte proliferation in a model of acute and delayed cardiac rejection. Chronic treatment with NOX-700 prolonged graft survival. In combination with low-dose cyclosporine (CsA), NOX-700 produced a synergistic action to prolong graft survival. NOX-700 decreased myocardial heme nitrosylation. A single bolus injection with NOX-700 in untreated recipients did not decrease heme nitrosylation but normalized NO metabolites and caused the formation of a mononitrosyl iron complex indicating NO scavenging in vivo. NOX-700 alone given with CsA inhibited protein nitration. NOX-700 or CsA each alone decreased intragraft inflammatory cell infiltration. NOX-700 also potentiated the CsA-induced inhibition of splenocyte proliferation ex vivo stimulated by concanavalin A. In splenocytes derived from treated rats but stimulated ex vivo in a mixed lymphocyte response (MLR), interferon-gamma and cyclin D3 gene expression was inhibited by NOX-700 suggesting down-regulation of lymphocyte activation and proliferation by in vivo treatment. These studies suggest that NOX-700 is protective in cardiac rejection, in part, by scavenging of NO and by limiting lymphocyte activation infiltration.
