[Sildenafil improves right ventricular function in a cardiac transplant recipient]. We report the case of a male patient who underwent orthotopic cardiac transplantation. A marginal donor was used, because the recipient's clinical condition was critical. He experienced cardiogenic shock due to right ventricular dysfunction secondary to pulmonary hypertension associated with vasoplegia. After the introduction of sildenafil, the patient recovered hemodynamically, his pulmonary vascular resistance decreased, the vasoactive drugs were withdrawn, and his right ventricular function improved.
