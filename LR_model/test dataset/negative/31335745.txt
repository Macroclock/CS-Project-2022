Pediatric heart transplantation in the current era. To provide an international perspective and current review of pediatric heart transplantation (PHTx). Waitlist survival and long-term outcomes in PHTx continue to improve. Strategies to maximize donor pool utilization include ABO incompatible listing for infants and expanded donor-to-recipient weight ranges. However, there is a high degree of practice variation internationally, from listing strategies and donor acceptance practices to chronic immunosuppression regimens, long-term graft surveillance, and consideration for retransplantation. Common indications for PHTx include end-stage congenital heart disease and cardiomyopathy. Current median graft survival among PHTx recipients ranges from 13 to 22 years. Common morbidities include infection, rejection, renal dysfunction, coronary allograft vasculopathy, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease. International registry data, collaborative initiatives to standardize management, and multicenter studies continue to improve knowledge and advancement of the field.
