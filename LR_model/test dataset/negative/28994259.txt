Long distance heart transplantation: a tale of two cities. In this 'paired' case report, we describe two heart transplants performed 3â€‰days apart at our centre. Both cases involved very prolonged transportation time of the donor heart. In one case, the donor heart was transported in an ice chest, while in the other case the organ was transported using a normothermic ex vivo perfusion (NEVP) system. The additional retrieval costs incurred by the use NEVP were more than offset by the reduction in subsequent inpatient costs.
