Use of calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors after cardiac transplantation. Hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes are very common problems following heart transplantation and may contribute to the development and progression of graft coronary artery disease. This article reviews current data on clinical use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers in patients who have had heart transplants. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers are established therapy for patients with cardiovascular disease. Use of these medications correlates with decreasing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. After heart transplantation, hypertension associated with calcineurin inhibitors can be managed effectively with antihypertensive therapy, but it may require use of more than one antihypertensive agent. Calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been associated with improved outcome measures in graft coronary artery disease.
