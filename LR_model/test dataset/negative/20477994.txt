Angiographic assessment of cardiac allograft vasculopathy: results of a Consensus Conference of the Task Force for Thoracic Organ Transplantation of the German Cardiac Society. Angiograms of cardiac transplant (HTx) recipients were to be evaluated in a ring experiment and a joint consensus on criteria of angiographic evaluation of coronary arteries of HTx patients was to be reached. Twenty-four coronary angiograms from 11 hospitals were circulated. One hundred eighty-eight blinded evaluations were returned. A joint evaluation by six experienced cardiologists was used as reference standard and a consensus evaluation form was developed. Significant lesions (stenosis 75%, 50% in the left main coronary artery) were diagnosed in 10/23 abnormal coronary angiograms (41.7%). Interventional revascularization was recommended in 8/10 (80%). In 21 coronary angiograms distal pruning was found and in 11/21 (52.4%) cases with distal pruning occlusion of at least one peripheral vessel was detected. The best kappa value (0.7) was found for the presence of at least one clinically significant stenosis. Agreement on the site and grade of local stenosis was much less. Some agreement on remodeling was found in assessing diffuse narrowing in the LCA (kappa=0.371, P<0.001). The kappa value for peripheral obliteration was 0.331 (P=0.001). Angiographic evaluation of cardiac allograft vasculopathy, particularly of diffuse and peripheral disease and remodeling, needs standardization. This should be performed in a downward compatible improvement process.
