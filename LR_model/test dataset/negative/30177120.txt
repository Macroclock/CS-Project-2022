Relationship Between Satisfaction With Social Support and Self-Efficacy and the Occurrence of Depressive Symptoms and Stress in Heart Transplant Recipients. Heart transplantation is a recognized and effective therapeutic method for treating end-stage circulatory failure. Physical factors and psychosocial issues among heart transplant recipients have been addressed in an increasing number of studies. According to the transactional model of stress, social support is one of the resources that facilitate coping with stress. The use of social support is related to a lower severity of depression and stress. The research objective was to assess the relationship between satisfaction with social support and self-efficacy and the occurrence of depressive symptoms and stress in heart transplant recipients. The study involved 123 participants, including 30 women and 93 men with mean age of 54.8 years (SD = 13.25). Berlin Social Support Scales, Beck Depression Inventory, and General Self-Efficacy Scale were used in the study. According to the analysis, the degree of depression decreased with increased emotional social support (r = -34; P < .001), instrumental social support (r = -378; P < .01), and perceived support (r=-387; P < .001); the degree of stress decreased with an increase in the application of instrumental support (r= 0.36; P<.001), emotional support (r=-0.31; P<.001), and perceived support (r=0,363; P<.001). The level of self-efficacy had a positive impact on emotional and instrumental support as well as on the perceived and actually received support. A regression analysis proved the level of (instrumental) social support and self-efficacy act as predictors of the incidence of depression (R The obtained results support the positive impact of social support and self-efficacy on the occurrence of depressive symptoms and stress.
