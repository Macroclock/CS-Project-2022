An approach to endomyocardial biopsy interpretation. The endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) remains the gold standard mode of investigation for diagnosing many primary and secondary cardiac conditions. Through a percutaneous and transvenous route, tissue fragments are generally procured from the right ventricular septum, with very few complications. Widespread use of EMB followed the development of heart transplantation as a means to follow allograft rejection. It has since been useful in helping to diagnose conditions affecting the heart, including cardiomyopathies, myocarditis, infiltrative lesions, arrhythmias, and drug toxicities. The procedure has also been used as a research tool to investigate the natural history of disease and the cardiotoxicity of new medications. This review presents an approach to the evaluation of the EMB, which is particularly directed towards those who may be asked to interpret such biopsies, but are not dedicated cardiovascular pathologists. Through a systematic evaluation of the endocardium, myocardium, interstitium, and intramural vessels, in the context of a complete clinical history, enough information can be deduced to diagnose or exclude specific conditions of clinical value.
