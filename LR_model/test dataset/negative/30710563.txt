Molecular events contributing to successful pediatric cardiac transplantation in HLA sensitized recipients. Antibodies to HLA resulting in positive cytotoxicity crossmatch are generally considered a contraindication for cardiac transplantation. However, cardiac transplantations have been performed in children by reducing the Abs and modifying immunosuppression. To identify mechanisms leading to allograft acceptance in the presence of Abs to donor HLA, we analyzed priming events in endothelial cells (EC) by incubating with sera containing low levels of anti-HLA followed by saturating concentration of anti-HLA. Pre-transplant sera were obtained from children with low levels of Abs to HLA who underwent transplantation. EC were selected for donor HLA and exposed to sera for 72â€¯h (priming), followed by saturating concentrations of anti-HLA (challenge). Priming of EC with sera induced the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt mediated by the BMP4/WNT pathway and subsequent challenge with panel reactive antibody sera increased survival genes Bcl2 and Heme oxygenase-1, decreased adhesion molecules, induced complement inhibitory proteins and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, EC which did not express donor HLA showed decreased anti-apoptotic genes. Primed EC, upon challenge with anti-HLA, results in increased survival genes, decreased adhesion molecules, induction of complement inhibitory proteins, and downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may result in accommodation of pediatric cardiac allografts despite HLA sensitization.
