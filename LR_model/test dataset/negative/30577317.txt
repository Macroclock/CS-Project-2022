Successful Heart Transplantation After Desensitization in a Patient With Extremely High Panel-Reactive Antibody Levels and Pretransplant Donor-Specific Antibody: A Case Report. Elevated panel-reactive antibody (PRA) levels serve as a significant risk factor for allograft survival and episodes of rejection after heart transplantation (HTX). Patients with high PRA levels tend to show expressions of donor-specific human leukocyte antigen antibodies (DSA), which can cause catastrophic hyperacute rejection after HTX. Therefore, such highly sensitized patients are required to undergo strategic perioperative desensitization therapy. We describe a successful HTX after desensitization in a patient with extremely high PRA levels and pretransplant DSA positivity.
