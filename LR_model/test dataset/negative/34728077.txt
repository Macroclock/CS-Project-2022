Incidence of Post-Heart Transplant Chronic Thyroiditis and Its Association With Pretransplant Amiodarone Use. Chronic thyroiditis (CT) is a common cause of thyroid dysfunction and could therefore adversely affect outcomes in patients undergoing heart transplant (HT). The incidence of post-HT CT and whether amiodarone, a commonly used anti-arrhythmic drug in patients with heart failure during pre-HT period, is associated with the development of post-HT CT are unknown. A retrospective review of HT recipients from February 2, 2010 to October 16, 2018 was performed. Patients who lacked relevant pre-/post-HT records, underwent thyroidectomy, had pre-HT thyroid dysfunction or thyroiditis within 15 days post-HT, and those on amiodarone during the post-HT period were excluded, yielding a final cohort of 75 patients. Patients had a mean age of 63.3 ± 1.4 years and were predominantly male (90.7%) and white (80%). The incidence of post-HT CT was 32% with the majority (83.3%) manifesting as hypothyroidism. Median time to diagnosis of CT after transplant was 10.2 months (interquartile range, 4-27.4). Additionally, the CT group had higher pre-HT use of amiodarone (non-CT vs CT: 21.6% vs 50%, P = .01), higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (non-CT vs CT: 23.5% vs 45.8%; P = .05), and more stage IV/V chronic kidney disease (non-CT vs CT: 2% vs 16.7%, P = .02). On multivariate analysis, pre-HT amiodarone use was associated with the development of post-HT CT after adjustment for age, sex, and chronic kidney disease (odds ratio, 3.65; 95% CI, 1.17-11.44; P = .03). The incidence of post-HT CT is high and is strongly associated with pre-HT amiodarone use underpinning the importance of closely following the post-HT thyroid profile in these patients.
