Graft survival after cardiac transplantation for alcohol cardiomyopathy. Alcohol cardiomyopathy (ACM) constitutes up to 40% of patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Transplant-free survival is worse for patients with ACM versus idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) with continued exposure. The prognosis for patients with ACM after cardiac transplantation is unknown. We evaluated adults who underwent single-organ, cardiac transplantation from 1994 to 2009 with a diagnosis of ACM (n=134) or IDCM (n=10,243) in the Organ Procurement Transplantation Network registry. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated by cohort for time until graft failure, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and hospitalization for rejection. A Cox proportional hazards model was created to determine factors associated with each outcome. Patients with ACM were more likely to be males (P<0.0001), minorities (P<0.0001), and smokers (P=0.0310) compared with IDCM. Overall graft survival was lower for the ACM cohort (P=0.0001). After multivariate analysis, ACM was not independently associated with graft survival (HR 1.341, 95% CI 0.944-1.906, P=0.1017). Creatinine, total bilirubin, minority ethnicity, graft under-sizing, life support, diabetes, and donor age were independent predictors of graft failure. There were no significant differences between primary cause of death, vasculopathy, or rejection. There was no association between ACM and graft survival in this large registry study, but poorer overall survival in the ACM cohort was associated with other recipient characteristics.
