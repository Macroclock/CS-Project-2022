Steroid withdrawal and reduction of cyclosporine A under mycophenolate mofetil after heart transplantation. Survival and quality of life after heart transplantation are limited by a significant incidence of cardiovascular complications. Side effects of immunosuppressives contribute unfavorably. Aim of this study was to determine (1) whether withdrawal of corticosteroids and dose reduction of cyclosporine A can be performed safely under immunosuppressive therapy with mycophenolate mofetil and (2) if this is beneficial for renal function and cardiovascular risk reduction. Long term heart transplant recipients on steroids and cyclosporine A were examined in a monocentric, prospective, single-arm cohort study. Steroids were withdrawn, mycophenolate mofetil introduced and cyclosporine A dose reduced (target level 50-90 ng/ml). Follow up was 24 months. 23 patients were analyzed: Renal parameters (creatinine, urea, uric acid) improved significantly (p<0.01), as did cardiovascular parameters (heart rate [p<0.05], systolic and diastolic blood pressure [p<0.01]), HbA1c (p<0.05) and triglycerides (p<0.05). In contrast, the self-percepted state of health (SF36â„¢) decreased. Drop outs occurred mostly due to steroid withdrawal syndrome [n=7]. The incidence of adverse events reflected the usual course after heart transplantation. We conclude that CS free immunosuppression comprising reduced cyclosporine levels and addition of MMF in long term heart transplant recipients is safe and improves the cardiovascular risk profile, carbohydrate metabolism and renal function.
