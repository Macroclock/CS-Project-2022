[Combined heart and kidney transplantation in Fabry's disease: Long-term outcomes in two patients]. Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder linked to an alpha-galactosidase A deficiency that can lead to heart and kidney failure. There is little data about the prognosis of patients who undergo a combined heart and kidney transplantation. Two brothers who were diagnosed with Fabry disease after the age of 30 years underwent a combined heart and kidney transplantation at respectively 49 and 42 years of age because of a severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with end stage renal failure. They are alive respectively 4 and 9 years after the transplantation. No recurrence of the disease in the transplanted organs has been found. Combined heart and kidney transplantation in Fabry disease is an efficient therapy for the cardiomyopathy and kidney failure. Its prognosis can be good when the patients are carefully selected. However, an early diagnosis is critical in order to avoid a procedure associated with a high perioperative mortality.
