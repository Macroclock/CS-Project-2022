Center Variation in Indication and Short-Term Outcomes after Pediatric Heart Transplantation: Analysis of a Merged United Network for Organ Sharing - Pediatric Health Information System Cohort. The relationship between center-specific variation in indication for pediatric heart transplantation and short-term outcomes after heart transplantation is not well described. We used merged patient- and hospital-level data from the United Network for Organ Sharing and the Pediatric Health Information Systems to analyze outcomes according to transplant indication for a cohort of children (≤ 21 years old) who underwent heart transplantation between 2004 and 2015. Outcomes included 30-day mortality, transplant hospital admission mortality, and hospital length of stay, with multivariable adjustment performed according to patient and center characteristics. The merged cohort reflected 2169 heart transplants at 20 U.S. centers. The median number of transplants annually at each center was 11.6, but ranged from 3.5 to 22.6 transplants/year. Congenital heart disease was the indication in the plurality of cases (49.2%), with cardiomyopathy (46%) and myocarditis (4.8%) accounting for the remainder. There was significant center-to-center variability in congenital heart disease as the principal indication, ranging from 15% to 66% (P < 0.0001). After adjustment, neither center volume nor proportion of indications for transplantation were associated with 30-day or transplant hospital admission mortality. In this large, merged pediatric cohort, variation was observed at center level in annual transplant volume and prevalence of indications for heart transplantation. Despite this variability, center volume and proportion of indications represented at a given center did not appear to impact short-term outcomes. 'Heart transplantation', 'Outcomes', 'Pediatrics'
