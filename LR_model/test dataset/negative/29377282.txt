Impact of intraoperative cytokine adsorption on outcome of patients undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation-an observational study. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of intraoperative cytokine adsorption on the perioperative vasoplegia, inflammatory response and outcome during orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). Eighty-four OHT patients were separated into the cytokine adsorption (CA)-treated group or controls. Vasopressor demand, inflammatory response described by procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, and postoperative outcome were assessed performing propensity score matching. In the 16 matched pairs, the median noradrenaline requirement was significantly less in the CA-treated patients than in the controls on the first and second postoperative days (0.14 vs 0.3 μg*kg Intraoperative CA treatment was associated with reduced vasopressor demand with a favorable tendency in length of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and renal replacement therapy. CA treatment was not linked to higher rates of adverse events. 'cardiac surgery', 'cytosorb', 'heart transplantation', 'hemoadsorption', 'inflammatory response', 'procalcitonin'
