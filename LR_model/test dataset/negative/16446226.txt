Statin-associated QTc interval shortening as prognostic indicator in heart transplant recipients. Statin treatment promotes survival after cardiac transplantation by reducing cholesterol levels, allograft rejection, and transplant coronary artery disease. Analysis of data from 114 heart transplant recipients (including 86 treated with statins for < or =1 year post-transplantation) revealed that statins were associated with shortened corrected QT intervals (QTc), reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and reduced transplant coronary artery disease incidence at 1 year and improved survival at 5 years. Statin-associated QTc shortening thus appears to be a favorable prognostic sign after transplantation.
