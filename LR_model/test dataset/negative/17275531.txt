Nesiritide as bridge to multi-organ transplantation: a case report. Nesiritide, an intravenous form of human B-type natriuretic peptide, has been approved as treatment for patients with acute decompensated heart failure. Due to its action on different receptors, nesiritide has many effects, including vasodilation and natriuresis. Cardiac preload and afterload decrease, leading to an increase in cardiac output through effects on smooth muscle and the kidneys. As a bridge to cardiac transplantation, nesiritide has been used to maintain vasodilation and diuresis without sacrificing kidney function. Our patient, prior to multi-organ transplantation, had a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 41 mm Hg on milrinone monotherapy, which decreased slightly with nitroprusside and further decreased to 4 mm Hg after the addition of nesiritide. The patient's measured creatinine clearance level was calculated to be 40 mL/min. When nesiritide therapy was begun, the renal function did not improve, but, as the hemodynamics improved, renal function did not decrease.
