Myocardial Fibrosis as a Predictor of Sudden Death in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease. The "gray zone" of myocardial fibrosis (GZF) on cardiovascular magnetic resonance may be a substrate for ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). The purpose of this study was to determine whether GZF predicts sudden cardiac death (SCD) and VAs (ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and a wide range of left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEFs). In this retrospective study of CAD patients, the presence of myocardial fibrosis on visual assessment (MF Among 979 patients (mean age [± SD]: 65.8 ± 12.3 years), 29 (2.96%) experienced SCD and 80 (8.17%) met the arrhythmic endpoint over median 5.82 years (interquartile range: 4.1 to 7.3 years). In the whole cohort, MF In CAD patients, MF 'cardiovascular magnetic resonance', 'gray zone mass', 'implantable cardioverter-defibrillator', 'peri-infarct mass', 'primary prevention', 'ventricular fibrillation', 'ventricular tachycardia'
