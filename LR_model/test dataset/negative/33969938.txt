Treatment of donor-specific antibody-mediated rejection after heart transplantation by IgM-enriched human immunoglobulin. Antibody-mediated graft rejection caused by donor-specific antibodies (DSA-MR) remains a serious problem after heart transplantation (HTx). IgM-enriched human intravenous immunoglobulin (IGM-IVIG) consists of 76% IgG, 12% IgM, and 12% IgA and provides a new multifactorial approach for DSA-MR. Between 2017 and 2020, four (P1-4) of 102 patients developed DSA-MR after HTx in our department and were repetitively treated with IGM-IVIG in combination with anti-thymocyte globulin. While in P1 and P4, DSA-MR occurred within the early post-operative interval, P2 and P3 developed DSA-MR approximately 1Â year after transplantation. An impairment of ventricular function was observed in three of four patients. Furthermore, P1 and P4 suffered from malign ventricular arrhythmias. After the application of IGM-IVIG, the ventricular function recovered, and all patients could be discharged from the hospital. As part of a multifactorial therapeutic approach, treatment with IGM-IVIG seems to be a safe and effective strategy to address DSA-MR.
