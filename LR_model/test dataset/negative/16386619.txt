Value of NT-proBNP determinations in the follow-up of heart transplantation. The N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) has been useful in the diagnosis and follow-up of heart failure. Whether it can be useful in the detection of acute rejection (AR) after heart transplantation (HT) has not been addressed. Our aim was to assess the prognostic value of NT-proBNP determinations after HT. We analyzed 137 endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) performed in 51 patients as assessment of AR and correlated them with NT-proBNP determinations. The value of NT-proBNP in the early follow-up of the novo HT was also assessed. AR grade > or =3A was diagnosed in 10 of the 137 performed biopsies. There were no significant differences in NT-proBNP values between patients with or without AR (1047 +/- 629 versus 1886 +/- 3026 pg/mL, P = NS). There were 24 de novo HT, in these patients increased NT-proBNP levels showed an inverse significant correlation with time since HT (r = -0.40, P = .0001). During follow-up, 15 of the novo HT had a descending NT-proBNP curve over time, and in the remaining 9 (37%) a late increase of NT-proBNP values were observed. Those 9 patients had the following complications: AR > or =3A in 5 cases, 1 death, 2 required a permanent pacemaker, and in the last patient a significant EMB could not be obtained. NT-proBNP values follow a descending curve early after HT. During the first months, a late increase of NT-proBNP value was associated with HT complications, with AR being the most frequent. Isolated increased NT-proBNP levels were not useful for the detection of AR. More studies are needed to establish the prognostic value of NT-proBNP after HT.
