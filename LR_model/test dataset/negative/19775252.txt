Luminex-based virtual crossmatching facilitates combined third-time cardiac and de novo renal transplantation in a sensitized patient with sustained antibody-mediated cardiac allograft rejection. Allosensitization represents a major obstacle to successful re-transplantation since circulating antibodies can elicit antibody-mediated rejection episodes with subsequent graft failure. Since sensitization is primarily considered a contraindication to transplantation the duration for patients waiting for a suitable donor organ to become available is considerably prolonged. Herein, we report on the successful application of a Luminex-based virtual crossmatch approach to facilitate combined third-time cardiac and de novo renal transplantation in a sensitized patient with sustained antibody-mediated cardiac allograft rejection.
