Cardiac transplantation: five years' activity. To analyze the initial five years experience of the new heart transplant program of Coimbra University Hospitals. Between November 2003 aid December 2008, 132 patients were transplanted, with a mean age of 52.0 years (range 3-71 years), of whom 98 were male (74%). Half of the patients had dilated cardiomyopathy and 33% ischemic cardiomyopathy. The mean age of donors was 31.7 years and 102 were male (77%). Donor hearts were harvested at a distance in 62% of cases. There was a gender mismatch between donor and recipient (F:M) in 19% of cases and ABO blood type disparity (not identical but compatible) in 11%. In all cases we used the technique of total transplantation with bicaval anastomosis, modified in this center. Mean ischemia time was 88.9 +/- 32.2 minutes. All patients received induction therapy with basiliximab and methylprednisolone. Six patients (4.5%) died within 30 days or during hospitalization, due to graft failure in four and hyperacute rejection in two. Two patients required prolonged ventilation, ten (8%) required inotropic support for more than 48 hours, and four required pacemaker implantation. Mean hospital stay was 15.6 +/- 15.2 days (median 13 days). Ninety percent of patients (116/129) were maintained on triple immunosuppressive therapy, including cyclosporine, the remainder receiving tacrolimus. In 23 patients it was necessary to change the immunosuppressive regimen due to renal and/or tumoral complications, or humoral rejection. All patients are followed regularly in the Surgical Center. Thirteen patients (10%) died late of cancer (6 patients), infection (4 patients), and pancreatitis, pulmonary hypertension and suicide (one patient each). Twenty-two patients (17%) had 25 episodes of cellular rejection (> or = 2R), with clinical consequences in only one case, and five had humoral rejection (3.9%). No patients died of late rejection, but there is evidence of mild graft vascular disease in one. Actuarial survival (Kaplan-Meier) at one and five years was 90% and 82%, respectively. In this initial series of five years we obtained results equivalent to or bette than those in centers with wider and longer experience, aided by self-correction arising from our own experience. This program has increased the rate of cardiac transplantation in Portugal to above the European average.
