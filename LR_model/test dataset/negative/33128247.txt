Micro- and macrovascular cardiac allograft vasculopathy in relation to 91 cardiovascular biomarkers in heart transplant recipients-An exploratory study. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) limits survival after heart transplantation (HTx), and the pathogenesis is not fully clarified. We aimed to investigate a wide range of biomarkers and their correlation with micro- and macrovascular CAV and major adverse cardiac events in HTx patients. We evaluated 91 cardiovascular disease-related proteins in 48 HTx patients using a novel proteomic panel. Patients were dichotomized according to micro- and macrovascular CAV burden determined by coronary angiography, optical coherence tomography, and  We found consistent differences in two proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis: significantly increased proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) (p < .05) and significantly decreased paraoxonase 3 (PON3) (p < .05). N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was significantly increased in patients with microvascular CAV (p < .05) and borderline significantly increased in patients experiencing major adverse cardiac events (p = .10) and patients with macrovascular CAV (p = .05). We identified consistent changes in two proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis which may be important players in the pathogenesis of CAV: PON3 and PCSK9. NT-proBNP also showed consistent changes across all groups but only reached statistical significance in patients with microvascular CAV. Our results warrant further validation in future studies.
