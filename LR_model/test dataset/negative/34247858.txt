Redo Heart Double-Lung Transplant in a Previous Double-Lung Transplant Recipient With Pneumonectomy: A Case Report. Placing a new donor lung into a postpneumonectomy pleural space has many potential surgical challenges. We report the technical challenges we faced in a case of a 42-year-old man who had initially undergone a double-lung transplant for idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Unfortunately, his left transplanted lung failed, which required a left pneumonectomy. Eight years later, his remaining right lung failed. He was evaluated and deemed suitable for retransplant. Our report presents the first successful redo heart double-lung transplant surgery preceded by pneumonectomy. There were significant technical intraoperative challenges; however, the procedure was performed successfully with an uneventful postoperative course and follow-up.
