Pediatric Heart Transplant Recipients Bridged with Biventricular Assist Device Have Worse 1 Year Graft Survival. There are little data on postheart transplant (HT) outcomes for pediatric patients that were supported to HT with biventricular assist device (BiVAD). The United Network for Organ Sharing database was queried for patients <18 years old at time of HT between January 2005 and March 2018, excluding patients bridged with total artificial hearts and right ventricular assist device (VAD). Of 4,904 pediatric HT recipients, patients were grouped by no VAD support (3,934; 80.2%), left ventricular assist device only (736; 15%), and BiVAD (234; 4.8%). Overall graft survival analysis indicates crossing hazard rates between groups over time with the BiVAD group having a significantly lower graft survival at 1 year post-HT. A Cox model adjusted for age, era, diagnosis, and time by group interaction demonstrated increased 1 year hazard ratio (HR) of 8.5 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 6.15-11.79) comparing BiVAD to no VAD. Comparable hazard between BiVAD and no VAD groups were found at 5 years (HR 1.01; 95% CI: 0.67-1.51), while lower hazard for the BiVAD group was found at 10 years post-HT (HR 0.07; 95% CI: 0.03-0.18). Although pre-HT BiVAD support leads to worse graft survival 1 year post-HT, long-term survival is acceptable.
