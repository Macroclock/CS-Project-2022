Recurrent cardiac amyloidosis following previous heart transplantation. Recurrent cardiac amyloidosis has been reported in the literature. We present two cases, one at 41 months after heart transplant and autologous stem cell transplant, and the other, at 83 months following heart transplantation. The former is the first case ever reported of a patient with amyloid light chain amyloidosis with systemic recurrence following these two treatment modalities, and the latter is a patient with hereditary amyloidosis, whose interval to disease recurrence is the longest ever reported for this type.
