Transcatheter stenting of superior vena cava obstruction after pediatric heart transplantation: A single-center experience assessing risk factors and outcomes. Transcatheter stent implantation for SVC obstruction following OHT has been well described, particularly in pediatric patients. This study describes a large single-center pediatric heart transplant experience that investigates the risk factors for SVC stenosis requiring stent implantation and its associated outcomes. All pediatric OHTs between January 1, 2000, and December 12, 2016, were examined for risk factors. Twelve of 349 (3.4%) OHTs required SVC stent implantation. Patients who required stents were younger (2.5 years vs 10.0 years, P = 0.0097), weighed less (8.6 kg vs 26.0 kg, P = 0.0024), and were more likely to have had CHD (83% vs 32%, P = 0.001) or previous SCPA (58% vs 18%, P = 0.002). Bicaval anastomosis was not associated with subsequent SVC stent implantation. Symptoms included SVC syndrome and chylous effusions. All 12 patients had evidence of significant SVC obstruction by both echocardiographic Doppler interrogation and transcatheter angiography. There were no acute procedural complications; however, reinterventions were common (four of 12 patients) and occurred at a mean of 5.7 ± 3.6 months poststent implantation. In conclusion, transcatheter SVC stent implantation is safe and effective after OHT. There were significant associations between SVC stent implantation and younger age, smaller weight, CHD, and history of SCPA, but not with bicaval anastomosis or donor-recipient weight ratio.
