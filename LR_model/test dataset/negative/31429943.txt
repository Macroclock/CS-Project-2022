Biventricular Impella use in pediatric patients with severe graft dysfunction from acute rejection after heart transplantation. Rejection with severe hemodynamic compromise is a significant source of morbidity and mortality for pediatric heart transplant patients. Traditionally, treatment for these patients includes inotropes and escalation to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) when necessary. There is increasing interest in using percutaneous ventricular assistive devices in the pediatric population as a less invasive alternative to ECMO. We report the largest case series to date of biventricular support using percutaneous Impella devices. Retrospective case series was performed by chart review. Hemodynamics, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and indices of end organ function were collected before and after Impella placement. A 14-year-old male, 18-year-old male, and 19-year-old female, all status post heart transplant, presented with severely decreased biventricular function due to presumed clinical rejection, requiring maximal inotropic support without improvement. In all the three cases, simultaneous Impella CP and RP devices were placed percutaneously. Prior to implantation, LVEFs were 40%, 23%, and 25%, respectively. Hemodynamics measured invasively prior to device placement showed elevated filling pressures. Adverse events while on support included bleeding, hemolysis, and right femoral arterial dissection during implantation. All patients were successfully weaned from the devices and survived to discharge. The average time of right-sided support and total support was 11 days and 13Â days, respectively. After device removal, right-sided pressures and echocardiographic measurements showed improvement in all patients. Bilateral Impella configuration (BiPella) is a viable option for temporary mechanical circulatory support in pediatric patients with significant graft dysfunction.
