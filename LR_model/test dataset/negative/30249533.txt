Promising utilization areas of therapeutic plasmapheresis in cardiovascular surgery practice. Apheresis is performed for treatment of numerous diseases by removing auto-antibodies, antigen-antibody complexes, allo-antibodies, paraproteins, non-Ig proteins, toxins, exogenous poisons. In current study, we present our experience of using therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in patients with different types of clinical scenarios. Between January 2013 and May 2016, we retrospectively presented the results of 64 patients in whom postoperative TPE was performed in ICU setting after cardiac surgery. Patients were grouped into four as; 1-sepsis (n = 26), 2-hepatorenal syndrome(n = 24), 3-antibody mediated rejection(AMR) following heart transplantation(n = 4) and 4-right heart failure(RHF) after left ventricular asist device(LVAD)(n = 10). Hemodynamic parameters were monitored constantly, pre- and post-procedure peripheral blood tests including renal and liver functions and daily complete blood count (CBC), sedimentation, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin (ng/ml) levels were studied. The mean age was 61 ± 17.67 years old and 56.25% (n = 36) were male. Mean Pre TPE left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (%), central venous pressure (CVP)(mmHg) pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)(mmHg) and pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP)(mmHg) were measured as 41.8 ± 8.1, 15.5 ± 4.4, 17.3 ± 3.24 and 39.9 ± 5.4, respectively. Procalcitonin (ng/ml) level of patients undergoing TPE due to sepsis was significantly reduced from 873 ± 401 ng/ml to 248 ± 132 ng/ml. Seventeen (26.5%) patients died in hospital during treatment, mean length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay(days) was 13.2 ± 5.1. This study shows that TEP is a safe and feasible treatment modality in patients with different types of complications after cardiac surgery and hopefully this study will lead to new utilization areas.
