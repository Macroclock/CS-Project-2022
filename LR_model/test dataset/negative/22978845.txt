HeartMate-II left ventricular assist device infections resulting from gastrointestinal-tract fistulas. In patients with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), pump-related infection can cause adverse effects that may result in death. We describe three patients who had infections related to a fistula between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the LVAD pocket and who subsequently underwent successful heart transplantation without developing sepsis. In no case did the LVAD-related infection adversely affect the outcome of transplantation. For detecting the fistulas, full upper-GI endoscopy and colonoscopy were superior to other types of diagnostic imaging studies.
