Donor heart selection: the outcome of "unacceptable" donors. The decline in the number of suitable donor hearts has led to an increasing interest in the use of previously unacceptable donors. In the United Kingdom, if one centre declines a donor heart on medical grounds it may be offered to other centres. This multi-centre study aimed to evaluate the outcome of recipients of donor hearts considered medically unsuitable for transplantation by one centre that were used in other centres. Between April 1998 and March 2003, ninety-three donor hearts (group A) were transplanted, after being considered medically unsuitable for transplantation by another centre. During the same period, 723 hearts (group B) were transplanted in the UK using donors not previously rejected. Data on the donors and recipients was obtained from the UK transplant database. Comparative analysis on the two groups was performed using SPSS 11.5 for Windows. The characteristics of recipients were similar in both groups. The main reasons for refusal of hearts are listed below. In most cases there was more than one reason for refusing the donor heart. We did not find significant differences in the post-operative mortality (up to 30 days), ICU and hospital stay and cardiac cause of death between the two groups. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed no significant difference in the long-term survival, with Log Rank test = 0.30. This study demonstrates that some hearts declined on medical grounds by one centre can safely be transplanted and should be offered out nationally. The use of these hearts was useful to expand the scarce donor pool and there does not seem to be a justification for denying recipients this extra source of organs.
