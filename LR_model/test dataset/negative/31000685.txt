Colchicine: An Impressive Effect on Posttransplant Capillary Leak Syndrome and Renal Failure. Capillary leak syndrome is a critical condition occasionally occurring posttransplant and is characterized by acute endothelial hyperpermeability leading to systemic protein-rich fluid extravasation and consequent hypovolemia, hypoperfusion, and acute kidney injury. Treatment is merely supportive and is based on osmotic drugs, diuretics, continuous renal replacement therapy, and surgical drainage. However, removal of the underlying inflammatory cause is mandatory to achieve stable resolution. Herein, we report the first successful treatment with colchicine in 2 life-threatening pediatric cases of capillary leak syndrome with renal failure occurring after transplant (heart and bone marrow) and unresponsive to any other line of therapy. Both cases were only palliated by supportive therapy and revealed an impressively rapid response to colchicine both in terms of diuresis and clinical condition recovery, allowing for the cessation of renal replacement therapy in a few hours. In both patients, colchicine was temporarily discontinued for transient leukopenia (attributed to an additive effect with mycophenolate mofetil), resulting in extravasation, and renal failure recurrence was restored only after colchicine reintroduction. Although the association of colchicine with an immunosuppressive drug was formerly contraindicated, no other adverse events were noted when using a minimized dose. Both patients are now maintaining a good renal function without recurrence of extravasation after 6 months of follow-up. In conclusion, this strikingly positive experience forces physicians to consider this old and cost-effective drug as a new, powerful rescue tool in such critical cases.
