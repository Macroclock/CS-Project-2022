Novel Application of Localized Nanodelivery of Anti-Interleukin-6 Protects Organ Transplant From Ischemia-Reperfusion Injuries. Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) evokes intragraft inflammatory responses, which markedly augment alloimmune responses against the graft. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these responses is fundamental to develop therapeutic regimens to prevent/ameliorate organ IRI. Here, we demonstrate that IRI results in a marked increase in mitochondrial damage and autophagy in dendritic cells (DCs). While autophagy is a survival mechanism for ischemic DCs, it also augments their production of interleukin (IL)-6. Allograft-derived dendritic cells (ADDCs) lacking autophagy-related gene 5 (Atg5) showed higher death rates posttransplantation. Transplanted ischemic hearts from CD11cCre/Atg5 conditional knockout mice showed marked reduction in intragraft expression of IL-6 compared with controls. To antagonize the effect of IL-6 locally in the heart, we synthesized novel anti-IL-6 nanoparticles with capacity for controlled release of anti-IL-6 over time. Compared with systemic delivery of anti-IL-6, localized delivery of anti-IL-6 significantly reduced chronic rejection with a markedly lower amount administered. Despite improved allograft histology, there were no changes to splenic T cell populations, illustrating the importance of local IL-6 in driving chronic rejection after IRI. These data carry potential clinical significance by identifying an innovative, targeted strategy to manipulate organs before transplantation to diminish inflammation, leading to improved long-term outcomes.
