Quality of life after pediatric solid organ transplantation. Long-term survival after pediatric solid organ transplantation is now the rule rather than the exception for increasing numbers of children with end-stage organ diseases. While transplantation restores organ function it does not necessarily return one to a normal life. Therefore, it is prudent to focus on assessment of not only traditional biologic outcomes but also the quality life for these children and their families. This article gives a brief overview of current definitions, conceptualizations, approaches to measurement of, and unique considerations in the evaluation of quality of life in children who have undergone solid organ transplant. Current understanding of quality of life in children who have undergone solid organ transplantation is reviewed, followed by limitations of current knowledge. Clinical implications are discussed and future research directions suggested.
