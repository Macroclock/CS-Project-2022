Impact of Insurance Type on Initial Rejection Post Heart Transplant. Heart transplantation allocation is often restricted from patients with low socioeconomic status (SES) due to concern for worse outcomes. We hypothesised that comorbidities would have a greater impact on risk of severe rejection post-orthotopic heart transplant than would Medicaid insurance and Median Household Income (MHI). A retrospective study of 171 patients who underwent orthotopic heart transplant between 7/1999-11/2013 at our facility were followed until 9/2014 for rejection hospitalisations or death. Survival and multivariable analyses with adjustment for age, race, and gender were performed to estimate the risk of severe cellular rejection, ≥2r (hazard ratio [HR], 95% confidence interval [CI]). Eighteen per cent of patients had Medicaid, and 72% of patients had low or medium MHI. Severe rejection occurred in 23% of patients. In the univariable analysis, Medicaid and diabetes were associated with increased risk of rejection while age >60 years, Caucasian race, and male sex were associated with reduced risk [Medicaid 2.32(1.20,4.51), diabetes 2.49(1.09,5.69), age 0.41(0.20,0.84), Caucasian 0.44(0.21,0.93), male 0.49(0.26,0.92)]. Median Household Income had no correlation [MHI 0.79(0.51,1.23)]. In the multivariable adjusted model, Medicaid was not associated with rejection [1.65(0.79,3.41)]; diabetes was strongly associated with risk of severe rejection [3.9(1.59,9.39)], and age >60 years was associated with risk reduction [0.42(0.20,0.82)]. Medicaid insurance and MHI were not associated with increased risk of severe cellular rejection requiring hospitalisation post-orthotopic heart transplant in the adjusted model. Rather the presence of diabetes and age ≤60 years were associated with increased risk. 'Diabetes', 'Outcomes', 'Socioeconomic status'
