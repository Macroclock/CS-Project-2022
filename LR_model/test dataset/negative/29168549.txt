First Polish analysis of the treatment of advanced heart failure in children with the use of BerlinHeart EXCOR mechanical circulatory support. The treatment of advanced heart failure (HF) in children and infants poses a serious management problem. Heart failure in that patient group is usually of congenital aetiology. The treatment schedules for paediatric patients are in most cases adapted from the guidelines for treatment of adults. Up to 2009, the treatment of that extremely difficult group of patients was limited to pharmacological therapy and occasional heart transplantations. Constantly increasing problems with recruiting donors, especially for the paediatric group, contribute to the fact that mechanical support with the use of ventricular assist devices is for many children the only chance of surviving the period of waiting for a heart donor. The aim of the study was to analyse the outcomes of circulatory support in Poland and to assess the advisability of this method for treatment of children with severe HF. This treatment of paediatric patients is currently used in three Polish centres. From December 28, 2009 to August 1, 2015, 27 implantations of BerlinHeart EXCOR® mechanical circulatory support system were performed in children aged from one month to 16 years (10 patients below one year of age; 37%). Left ventricular assist devices were implanted to 21 patients, whereas the remaining children received biventricular support. The most common reason for using this method was HF developed in the course of cardiomyopathy. In one case, HF after Fontan operation was the indication. The duration of the circulatory support period ranged from six to 1215 days. It was followed by successful heart transplantations in 10 (37%) patients, in five (18.1%) it resulted in regeneration of the heart, enabling explantation of the device, whereas three children are still waiting for transplantations. Nine (33%) children died during the therapy because of thromboembolic complications. As follows from our data, circulatory support utilising the BerlinHeart EXCOR® system is an effective and promising method used as a bridge to cardiac transplantation, or for regeneration of the myocardium in paediatric patients. In the group of the youngest and the most difficult patients, the method requires close cooperation of the medical and nursing personnel.
