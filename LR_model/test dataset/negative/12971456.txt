Lung and heart-lung transplantation at the University of Pittsburgh: 1982-2002. The University of Pittsburgh lung transplantation program began in 1982 and through 2002 we have performed 576 lung and 101 heart-lung transplants. One-, 3- and 5-year survival rates over the past decade have been 77%, 62% and 55%, respectively, comparing favorably to ISHLT registry outcomes of 73%, 57% and 46%. We continue to utilize a very thorough evaluation process but have been flexible and aggressive with potential recipients with regard to age, coronary artery disease and disease state (eg., scleroderma). Despite worldwide progress in the field of lung transplantation, many difficulties remain. The limited number of lungs deemed acceptable for transplantation continues to hinder application to a greater number of patients. Our efforts in this regard have focused on cooperation with our OPO in education and detailed donor management protocols. Chronic rejection also remains a major difficulty frequently leading to death. Recent work utilizing aerosol cyclosporine in patients with established chronic rejection suggests that this therapy may prolong life. We are also hopeful that recently initiated therapies utilizing T-cell induction strategies may contribute to further improvement in outcomes.
