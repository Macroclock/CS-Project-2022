Characteristics of cardiac allograft vasculopathy induced by immunomodulation in the miniature Swine. We aimed to develop swine cardiac transplantation model for study of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) and to characterize the mechanisms of its formation. Heterotropic cardiac transplantation was performed in swine leukocyte antigen mismatched miniature swine, and CAV was induced by immunomodulation by cyclosporine A (CyA). Histology and immunohistochemistry were performed to identify cellular components of CAV. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was developed for detection of 1 and Y-chromosome for identification of cell origin in the female donor to the male recipient heart transplantation model. CAV was successfully developed by immunomodulation of CyA. Severity of CAV revealed more prominent in the distal epicardial coronary arteries than proximal coronary arteries. Phenotype of the SMCs proliferated in the intimal thickening of CAV were mostly embryonal/secretory type. Our new chromosome specific probes for FISH method were useful for discrimination of sex of each cell, and proliferated SMCs were revealed to be mainly donor origin. CAV mimicking human heart transplantation can be developed by appropriate immunomodulation in the swine. In swine CAV, proliferated SMCs seen in the intimal thickening were demonstrated to be from the donor origin.
