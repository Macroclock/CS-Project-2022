A young male heart transplant recipient who developed CKD due to cyclosporine therapy after a decade. We report cyclosporine-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD) in a 38year old man who underwent cadaveric orthotopic heart transplant done 13 years ago. He was on triple immuno-suppression including micro-emulsion form of cyclosporine (neoral) with monitoring of his blood cyclosporine levels and serum creatinine. We discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms of cyclosporine toxicity in heart transplant recipients.
