Percutaneous dilational tracheotomy in solid-organ transplant recipients. Pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia and respiratory failure, are important contributors to posttransplantation morbidity and mortality among solid-organ transplant recipients. Percutaneous dilational tracheotomy (PDT) is cost-effective in critically ill patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation; however, the literature lacks reports about the effectiveness of this procedure in organ transplant recipients. Between August 2001 and February 2003, five recipients underwent PDT in our intensive care unit: two kidney, two liver, and one heart transplant recipient. The respective mean values for age, weight and APACHE II score were 41 +/- 7 yrs (range, 33-51 years), 63 +/- 14 kg (range, 40-80 kg), and 23 +/- 9 (range, 15-35). All PDTs were performed at the bedside by an experienced staff anesthesiologist under endoscopic guidance using the Griggs forceps dilational technique. The mean interval from transplantation to PDT was 58 +/- 56 months (range, 8 days to 132 months). In all cases, the indication for PDT was prolonged mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. The mean duration of endotracheal intubation before PDT was 4 +/- 3 days (range, 1-8 days). Transient hypoxemia (n = 1) and mild extratracheal bleeding (n = 1) were the only early complications. There were no late complications (including peristomal infection) or deaths associated with the procedures. Among the two patients who survived their stay in the intensive care unit, the functional and cosmetic outcomes of PDT were excellent. We recommend this technique for prolonged airway management in solid-organ transplant recipients.
