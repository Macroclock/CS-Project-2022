The role of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in heart transplantation. The number of centers that perform heart transplants has increased rapidly in recent years. Although transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography (TTE and TEE) are utilized frequently to diagnose and manage cardiac complications commonly found in this population postoperatively, little has been written about the routine use of intraoperative TEE. Intraoperative echo is ideally suited to identify acute complications during cardiac transplantation. This can include immediate signs of rejection, valvular abnormalities, and mechanical complications related to the surgical procedure. Many of these patients might require ventricular assist devices (VAD) to provide circulatory support, and intraoperative TEE can be used to verify correct positioning of the VAD hardware. In addition, many of the chronic complications that patients with heart transplants are at risk for may be serious yet asymptomatic. Therefore, a high quality, complete intraoperative echocardiographic study might serve as an important baseline to compare postoperative changes.
