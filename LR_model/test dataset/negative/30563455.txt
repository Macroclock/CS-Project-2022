Cardiac autotransplantation and ex vivo surgical repair of giant left atrium: a case presentation. Chronic Mitral Valve disease is strongly associated with Left atrial enlargement; the condition has a high mortality risk. Clinical manifestations include atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, thromboembolic events, and in cases of Giant Left Atrium (GLA) and a distorted cardiac silhouette. Full sternotomy, conventional open-heart surgery, reductive atrioplasty and atrioventricular valve repair are required to resolve symptoms. However, these procedures can be complicated due to the posterior location of the GLA and concomitant right lateral protrusion. Cardiac autotransplantation is superior under these conditions; it provides improved visual access to the posterior atrial wall and mitral valve, hence, facilitates corrective surgical procedures. We aimed to assess the clinical outcome of patients undergoing cardiac autotransplantation as the primary treatment modality to resolve GLA. Moreover, we evaluated the procedural safety profile and technical feasibility. Four patients, mean EuroSCORE II of 23.7% ± 7.7%, presented with heart failure, atrial fibrillation, left atrial diameter > 6.5 cm and a severe distorted cardiac silhouette; X-ray showed prominent right lateral protrusion. We performed cardiac autotransplantation using continuous retrograde perfusion with warm blood supplemented with glucose followed by atrioplasty, atrial plication, valve annuloplasty and valve repair on the explanted beating heart. The surgical approach reduced the left atrial area, mean reduction was - 90.71 cm Cardiac autotransplantation is an elegant surgical procedure that facilitates the surgical remodelling of Giant Left Atrium. Surgical repair on the ex vivo beating heart, under continuous warm blood perfusion, is a safe procedure applicable also to high-risk patients.
