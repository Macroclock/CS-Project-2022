Pharmacokinetic optimization of immunosuppressive therapy in thoracic transplantation: part II. Part I of this article, which appeared in the previous issue of the Journal, reviewed calcineurin inhibitors--ciclosporin and tacrolimus. In part II, we review the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic drug monitoring of mycophenolate and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors--sirolimus and everolimus--in thoracic transplantation, and we provide an overall discussion and suggest various areas for future study.
