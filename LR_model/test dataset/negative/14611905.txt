Anti-ICAM-1 antibody and CTLA-4Ig synergistically enhance immature dendritic cells to induce donor-specific immune tolerance in vivo. Immature dendritic cells (DC) have been demonstrated to induce T-cell hyporesponsiveness in vitro and immune tolerance in vivo. However, immature DC (iDC) may become mature once infused in vivo, thus limiting the prolongation of the allograft survival. Considering that mature DC express high level of B7, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and T-cell activation needs costimulation signals provided by DC, we selected anti-ICAM-1 mAb and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4Ig fusion protein (CTLA-4Ig) for in vivo administration to block costimulation pathways in order to further improve the efficacy of iDC to induce immune tolerance. Seven days before allogeneic cardiac transplantations, the recipients were intravenously (i.v.) pretreated of donor-derived iDC with or without simultaneous injections of anti-ICAM-1 mAb and CTLA-4Ig. CTLA-4Ig or anti-ICAM-1 mAb administration alone resulted in significant prolongation of cardiac allograft survival induced by iDC. When used simultaneously, CTLA-4Ig and anti-ICAM-1 mAb induced permanent allografts acceptance even in 90% recipients. The recipients could keep the skin alive for a longer time in the donor-specific second transplantation, but no effect was observed on the skin from C3H third-party mice. The efficient induction of donor-specific tolerance observed above may be related to the more potent inhibition of donor-specific T-cell responses including cytotoxicity activity, Th1 cytokines production, and alloantibody production by the combined use of anti-ICAM-1 mAb and CTLA-4Ig. Our data suggest that anti-ICAM-1 antibody and CTLA-4Ig can synergistically enhance iDC to induce donor-specific immune tolerance in vivo.
