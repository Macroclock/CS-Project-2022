Transplant Operative Considerations in Pulmonary Hypertension With Severe Right Heart Failure. Over the past several decades, the operation of choice for end-stage lung disease secondary to severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) has shifted from heart-lung transplantation (HLT) to bilateral lung transplantation (BLT). This change has maintained excellent long-term outcomes and is appropriate for the majority of patients presenting with end-stage disease in need of transplantation. However, a distinct subset of patients with severe PH have an excessive early mortality within 90 days of transplantation. Based on the different causes of this early mortality compared to BLT recipients with other indications, right heart failure and refractory primary graft dysfunction appear to play a significant role. It is therefore critical to identify this subset of patient during their evaluation for transplant. This distinction would allow specific patient referral for HLT, which may mitigate those causes of early mortality. Similarly, there is a subgroup of BLT recipients for severe PH that fail to recover right ventricular function, with suboptimal long-term functional status that is independent of early survival. Identification and referral for HLT of these patients may also be important. In this manuscript, we describe our institutional approach and consideration for the risks of early mortality from right heart failure and primary graft dysfunction, as well failure of right ventricular recovery long term. The described evaluation is used to ascertain those patients with severe PH who may benefit from an HLT over BLT.
