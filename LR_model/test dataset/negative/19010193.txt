Safety and efficacy of ezetimibe in a sample of cardiac transplant patients. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ezetimibe in a sample of transplanted cardiac patients. We undertook a descriptive retrospective observational study of 19 transplanted cardiac patients in whom treatment with ezetimibe was initiated at doses of 10 mg/d between 2004 and 2006, assessing tolerability and changes in lipid levels (total cholesterol and triglycerides), doses of immunosuppressive drugs, and the hepatic profile after 12 months of treatment. There was no effect on the doses required of any immunosuppressive drugs. We observed a reduction in cholesterol levels, with a normal distribution (mean +/- standard deviation 26.84 +/- 14 mg/dL) among patients with ezetimibe addition, despite no change in the statin doses. There were no changes in the levels of triglycerides, transaminases, or bilirubin, and no cases of rhabdomyolysis or myalgia. All patients continued to take the drug after 1 year of treatment. In our sample, the administration of ezetimibe to transplanted cardiac patients for 1 year was associated with a reduction in cholesterol levels by 26.8%. No substantial changes in the doses of immunosuppressive drugs could be attributed to the use of ezetimibe. Tolerance was good, with no need for drug withdrawal in any case.
