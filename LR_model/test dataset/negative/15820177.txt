Effect of exercise training on VO2peak and left ventricular systolic function in recent cardiac transplant recipients. This study examined the effect of 12 weeks of combined aerobic and resistance training on aerobic capacity, left ventricular ejection fraction, and arterial afterload during submaximal cycle exercise in 18 recent (<1 month from transplantation) cardiac transplant recipients. The main finding of this study is that 12 weeks of combined aerobic and resistance training is an effective intervention to increase aerobic capacity in this population. However, exercise training was not associated with favorable improvements in left ventricular systolic function, because stroke volume and ejection fraction were reduced after training because of an increase in arterial afterload.
