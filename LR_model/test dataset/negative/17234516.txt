Human herpesvirus-6 and -7 after lung and heart-lung transplantation. The impact of herpesvirus-6 and -7 (HHV-6, HHV-7) activation in lung transplant recipients is still poorly understood. We report the appearance of HHV-6 and HHV-7 antigenemia after lung transplantation and evaluate the efficacy of anti-viral drugs against these viruses. Twenty-two lung or heart-lung recipients were monitored for HHV-6, HHV-7 and cytomegalovirus (CMV) during 12 post-operative months. HHV-6- and HHV-7-specific antigens and CMV pp65 antigens were analyzed in blood leukocytes and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells by monoclonal antibodies. Ganciclovir or valganciclovir prophylaxis for a minimum of 3 months was given to 19 recipients at risk for CMV infection. HHV-6, HHV-7 and CMV antigenemia was detected in 20 (91%), 11 (50%) and 12 (55%) recipients (median 16, 31 and 165 days) after transplantation, respectively. HHV-6 antigenemia occurred in 15 (79%), HHV-7 antigenemia in 7 (37%) and CMV antigenemia in 1 (7%) of these patients during anti-viral prophylaxis. HHV-6 or HHV-7 antigenemia was frequently associated with CMV antigenemia, which was detected 3 to 12 months after transplantation. Ganciclovir or valganciclovir treatment of CMV infection was effective against the concomitant HHV-6 and HHV-7 antigenemia in 9 of 12 (75%) and 5 of 6 (83%) cases, respectively. One case of pneumonitis and 1 of encephalitis were temporally associated with HHV-6. No other clinical manifestations could be linked solely to HHV-6 or -7. HHV-6 and -7 antigenemia was common and appeared early after lung transplantation. CMV prophylaxis was not able to prevent the appearance of HHV-6 and -7 antigenemia.
