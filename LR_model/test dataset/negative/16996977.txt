Levosimendan reversing low output syndrome after heart transplantation. After heart transplantation primary graft failure is a major cause of early mortality. Treatment options include inotropes and mechanical assist devices. Developing better methods would impact on patients' short- and long-term survival. We present a case of primary graft failure manifested as cardiogenic shock unresponsive to catecholamines and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Reversal of low output syndrome was achieved with a new type of inotropic agent, levosimendan, leading to the later complete recovery.
