A specific COX-2 inhibitor attenuates cell infiltration but does not prolong graft survival in murine cardiac transplantation. COX-2 is a key factor in the progression of inflammation, the effects of a specific COX-2 inhibitor in cardiac transplantation have not yet been elucidated. To test the hypothesis that a COX-2 inhibitor can alter cardiac rejection, we analyzed graft survival using totally allomismatched grafts. Although the COX-2 inhibitor attenuated myocardial cell infiltration, the inhibitor did not prolong survival. We conclude that the COX-2 inhibition may have potential for the suppression of inflammation in cardiac allografts.
