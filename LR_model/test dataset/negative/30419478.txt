Endomyocardial fibrosis and myocardial infarction leading to diastolic and systolic dysfunction requiring transplantation. Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) is an endemic disease in tropical areas, characterized by restrictive physiology due to endocardial fibrous thickening of the ventricular chambers. We report the case of a 25-year-old man of African origin who presented with end-stage heart failure due to both diastolic and systolic dysfunction and extensive endocavitary thrombosis as proven by echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance. EMF diagnosis was confirmed by endomyocardial biopsy and the patient had eventually cardiac transplantation. The explanted heart revealed, besides features consistent with EMF, transmural post- myocardial infarction scarring, in the absence of significant coronary artery disease, most probably thromboembolic in origin.
