Orthotopic Heart Transplantation for Congenital Heart Disease with Dextrocardia: A Single-Center Clinic Experience. We report a modified transplantation surgical technique for CHD with dextrocardia which is rare and surgically challenging. From January 2015 to May 2018, 5 patients with end-stage CHD with dextrocardia underwent heart transplantation at our institute. They were 10, 29, 13, 15, and 22 years old, respectively; 3 of them had dextroversion, and the other 2 had mirror-image dextrocardia and post-TCPC. The atrial-atrial anastomosis was performed first between the donor's upper-left PVO and the recipient's lower-left PVO. The apex thereby rotated approximately 90° clockwise (to the right). The end-to-end donor and recipient aortas, vena cava, and pulmonary arteries were then anastomosed. The cold ischemic time of the donor heart was 284.6 ± 108.3 min, and the CPB time was 190.2 ± 43.8 min. The postoperative X-ray showed the apex on the right. Four patients were successfully discharged, and the follow-up times were 47 months, 36 months, 12 months, and 12 months. One post-TCPC patient died because of pneumonia and hypoxia at 59 postoperative days. Heart transplantation with dextrocardial CHD is rare. A 90° rotation at the left atrial level, aortic end-to-end anastomosis, and vena cava reconstruction by vascular prosthesis or systemic atrial cuff is a simple and effective surgical strategy.
