Solid Organ Transplantation Activities Evolution in Brazil: Analysis of 20 Years. From 1968 until 1997, transplantation-related activities were not properly regulated and were informally practiced. During 20 years, many legal and political changes influenced it. To provide a historical overview of the 20 years with a descriptive data analysis of a 20-year data set. We investigated information from Brazilian Transplantation Reports between 1997 and 2017. In this way, we classified all data into 5 Brazilian macro regions: Center-West, Northeast, North, Southeast, and South. In total, we included 27 states (including Capital District) and limited study to the heart, liver, and kidney. We analyzed 2835 data entries and associated population information from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. We observed 2 distinct groups, one uniquely formed by the North region, with figures significantly lower than the remaining regions. After 2003, Southeast, South, and Northeast regions indicated a growing movement, whereas Center-West indicated certain stability in 50 and ranging between 50 and 100 cases (yearly basis) after 2011. Recently (2016 and 2017), the South region indicates another crescendo movement suggesting another detachment from the other regions, but it is something not clearly observed and, if true, should be figured in new reports of Brazilian Association of Organ Transplantation. This study identified and observed the time-spatial progress of organ transplantation in Brazil. In conclusion, after analysis of this 20-year data consolidation related to organ transplantation in Brazil, we observed a public investment in implementing quality evaluation and safety to provide figures that deliver visibility to the numbers reported in this article.
