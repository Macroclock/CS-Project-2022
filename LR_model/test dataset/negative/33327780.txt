Immunomodulatory effects of mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of cardiac allograft rejection. Heart transplantation continues to be the gold standard clinical intervention to treat patients with end-stage heart failure. However, there are major complications associated with this surgical procedure that reduce the survival prognosis of heart transplant patients, including allograft rejection, malignancies, infections, and other complications that arise from the use of broad-spectrum immunosuppression drugs. Recent studies have demonstrated the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) against allotransplantation rejection in both  'Mesenchymal stem cells', 'heart transplantation', 'immunological tolerance', 'immunomodulation', 'rejection'
