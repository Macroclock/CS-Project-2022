Unusual heart transplantation for iterative disinsertion of mitral prosthesis. Heart transplantation is the gold standard of care for end-stage heart failure, usually associated with an impairment of left ventricular systolic function. We describe a case of heart transplantation in a 58-year-old man with normal left ventricular systolic function, because of recurrent mitral prosthesis disinsertion after multiple reoperations for infective endocarditis.
