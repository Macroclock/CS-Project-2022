Pediatric patient with restrictive cardiomyopathy on staged biventricular assist device support with Berlin Heart EXCOR® underwent heart transplantation successfully: the first case in Japan. Pure restrictive cardiomyopathy is a strong risk factor for poor outcomes in children with cardiomyopathy on ventricular assist devices. Owing to concomitant right heart failure, children with end-staged restrictive cardiomyopathy who are supported with a ventricular assist device often require a biventricular assist device, which is another risk factor for waitlist mortality in heart transplantation candidates. Herein, we report the case of a 3-year-old boy with pure restrictive cardiomyopathy who successfully underwent heart transplantation after 12 months of support with staged biventricular assist devices. Owing to the progression of diastolic dysfunction, the left ventricular assist device could not provide adequate circulation support. Despite the provision of biventricular assist device support, the patient required a complex management strategy that involved balancing the left and right ventricular assist device supports. We were able to stabilize the patient by careful synchronization of the supports and proceeded to heart transplantation.
