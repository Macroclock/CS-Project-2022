Transplantation of yeast-infected cardiac allografts: a report of 2 cases. For the first time in the literature to date, we report 2 cases of transplantation of yeast-infected cardiac allografts. In both cases, endocardial vegetations were observed before graft implantation. Microbiologic samples grew yeasts: Rhodotorula glutinis was found close to the left atrial appendage in the first case and Candida parapsilosis was identified in a vegetation located at the base of the tricuspid valve in the second case. We discuss the possible routes of donor organ infection and management of these 2 unusual cases.
