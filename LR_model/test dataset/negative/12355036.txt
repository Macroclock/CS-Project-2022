Outpatient management of venous thromboembolic disease with subcutaneous lepirudin: a case report. Outpatient treatment of deep venous thrombosis has gained widespread acceptance and is facilitated by the use of subcutaneous low molecular weight heparins (LMWH). We report two patients in whom subcutaneous lepirudin was used for long term anticoagulation after heart transplant or surgical pulmonary embolectomy because treatment with LMWH or warfarin was contraindicated, unsuccessful, or impractical. Neither bleeding complications nor recurrent thromboses developed. Subcutaneous lepirudin may be safely and effectively employed for the outpatient treatment of venous thrombosis in selected cases including patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and in those who fail LMWH.
