CTLA4-Ig abrogates the anti-globulin response and prolongs cardiac allograft survival after anti-CD2 treatment. CD2 is expressed on T cells and NK cells and is important in T cell activation, making it a potential target for immune intervention. Here, we report a series of experiments aimed at defining the ability of mAbs directed against the CD2 molecule to prevent cardiac allograft rejection in low and high responder rat strain combinations. Administration of the mouse anti-rat CD2 mAbs OX34 or OX55 around the time of transplantation prolonged survival of fully allogeneic Lewis (RT1l) cardiac allografts in low responder DA (RT1a) recipients (MST 14 days for OX55 and >100 days for OX34). Treatment with OX34 prolonged graft survival in the reciprocal high responder DA to Lewis rat strain combination (MST 19 days) and when combined with CTLA4-Ig resulted in long-term graft survival (MST>100 days). Despite these in vivo effects, OX34 had little effect on in vitro assays of lymphocyte activation. Instead, the ability of OX34 to extend allograft survival correlated with T cell depletion. Administration of OX34 induced a similar degree of CD4 T cell depletion in DA and Lewis recipients, but the CD4 depletion observed was more transient in Lewis recipients. Lewis, but not DA strain rats, developed an anti-murine Ig response. Combined treatment with CTLA4-Ig abolished the anti-globulin response to OX34 in Lewis recipients, prolonged circulation of OX34 and increased the extent and duration of CD4 depletion. We conclude that anti-CD2 treatment effectively prolongs cardiac allograft survival and addition of CTLA4-Ig increases its efficacy by abrogating the production of neutralising antibodies.
