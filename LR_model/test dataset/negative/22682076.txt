Atrial masses post cardiac transplantation: diagnostic and treatment dilemmas. Atrial masses postcardiac transplant are not well reported and their diagnosis and treatment can be challenging. In the asymptomatic patient, differentiating thrombus from cardiac tumor can sometimes be difficult and the use of multiple imaging modalities is recommended. Accurate diagnosis is imperative to inform a treatment plan that balances the benefits and risks of a medical versus surgical approach. We present three cases of atrial masses postcardiac transplant to illustrate this clinical dilemma.
