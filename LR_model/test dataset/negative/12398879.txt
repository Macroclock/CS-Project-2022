Risk of anaphylaxis from aprotinin re-exposure during LVAD removal and heart transplantation. Aprotinin has been shown to reduce transfusion requirements in re-operative cardiac surgery and in implantation of long-term left ventricular assist devices (LVAD). However, it is an antigenic polypeptide and re-exposure is associated with a small incidence of anaphylaxis. This report describes 2 cases of anaphylactic response to aprotinin when the agent was employed for both the LVAD implant and for the subsequent explant and cardiac transplant. Early re-exposure to just the test dose was associated with a significant incidence of anaphylaxis.
