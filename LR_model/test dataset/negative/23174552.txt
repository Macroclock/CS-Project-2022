Exercise in cardiovascular diseases. Analysis of extensive data has shown that exercise training provides significant impact on prevention and modification of cardiovascular diseases and mortality. In general, exercise recommendations for patients with cardiovascular diseases are based on individual aerobic capacity and comorbidities. Patients with acute syndromes benefit from participating in a cardiac rehabilitation program, whereas patients with chronic syndromes benefit from a life-long home-based program. In general, exercise prescription should involve aerobic activities in combination with resistance, flexibility, and balance exercises. This review will discuss an exercise prescription for patients with coronary artery disease, heart failure, and after heart transplantation. Detailed precautions for particular groups of patients will be discussed.
