Endogenous stress contributes to cardiac injury after heart transplantation in rats. Stress effect plays an important role in the development of some myocardial diseases. We hypothesized it was important nosogenesis to myocardial damage and cardiac allograft vasculopathy. The transplanted hearts from Lewis to Wister rats served as allografts and from Lewis to Lewis rats as isografts based Ono's model. The differential proteins in the transplanted hearts were separated by comparative proteome, and then identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and searched by Matrix Science software system. All transplanted hearts were characterized by lumen loss [(total vessel area-luminal area)/total vessel area] in the coronary artery 2 weeks after the operation [(2.07%+/-0.93%) vs. (27.58%+/-11.14%), P<0.01], but more predominant after 8 weeks [(2.34%+/-1.06%) vs. (72.29%+/-20.57%), P<0.01]. All samples of the left ventricle were analyzed by proteomic techniques and 37 distinct proteins involving their respective isoforms and subunits were identified. Nine proteins were correlated to endoplasmic reticulum stress effect and myocardial damage, and 2 proteins were verified by Western blot. Stress plays an important role in cardiac allograft damage and the development of rat cardiac allograft vasculopathy.
