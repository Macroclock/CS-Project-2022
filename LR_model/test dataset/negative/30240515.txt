Longitudinal changes in kidney function following heart transplantation: Stanford experience. Many heart transplant recipients experience declining kidney function following transplantation. We aimed to quantify change in kidney function in heart transplant recipients stratified by pre-transplant kidney function. A total of 230 adult heart transplant recipients between May 1, 2008, and December 31, 2014, were evaluated for up to 5 years post-transplant (median 1 year). Using 19 398 total estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) assessments, we evaluated trends in eGFR in recipients with normal/near-normal (eGFR ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m 'combined/dual heart-kidney transplant', 'heart transplant', 'kidney transplant', 'kidney/renal function'
