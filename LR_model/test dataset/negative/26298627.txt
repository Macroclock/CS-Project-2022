Assessment of Transition Readiness in Adolescents and Young Adults with Heart Disease. To evaluate transition readiness, including perceived knowledge deficits, self-efficacy, and self-management behaviors, in 13- to 25-year-olds with congenital heart disease or heart transplant and to examine the relationships between transition readiness assessment, information seeking behavior, and quality of life (QOL). In this cross-sectional study, patients (n = 164) completed the Transition Readiness Assessment and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory using an e-tablet, web-based format at a routine clinic visit. Median patient age was 18.1 years (range 13.0-25.5). Average perceived knowledge deficit score (% of items with no knowledge) was 25.7% (range 0%-75%). On a 100-point scale, the mean score was 72.0 ± 17.2 for self-efficacy and 49.7 ± 17.5 for self-management. Knowledge deficits were negatively correlated with self-efficacy (r = -0.45, P < .0001) and self-management (r = -0.36, P < .0001). Overall, 66% of patients requested information (73% ≥ 18 years old). Higher psychosocial QOL scores were correlated with lower knowledge deficit scores (r = -0.21, P = .01) and higher perceived self-efficacy scores (r = 0.41, P < .0001). Transition knowledge deficits are common and associated with decreased self-efficacy and self-management skills in adolescents and young adults with heart disease. Greater transition knowledge and perceived self-efficacy are associated with better psychosocial QOL. Routine assessment of transition readiness is recommended to facilitate recognition of deficits and interventions to promote successful transition outcomes.
