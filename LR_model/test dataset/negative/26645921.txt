Heart transplant recipient with history of Chagas disease and elevated panel-reactive antibodies. Chagas disease is caused by a protozoan named Trypanosoma cruzi transmitted to humans by reduviid bugs. Severe dilated cardiomyopathy from chronic T cruzi infection is the most common finding, leading to end-stage heart failure. Heart transplant is an effective treatment for Chagas heart disease. However, T cruzi reactivation is of great concern, predisposing patients to episodes of myocarditis and rejection. A 56-year-old woman with a history of Chagas disease and elevated calculated panel reactive antibodies (CPRAs) underwent induction therapy and desensitization strategies aimed at lowering CPRAs, as elevated CPRAs have been implicated in the development of antibody-mediated rejection and reduced allograft survival. Clinical phases and signs and symptoms of Chagas disease are briefly described in an attempt to promote awareness of the disease among clinicians. In addition, serology assays approved in the United States as well as recommendations of experts on Chagas disease to assess tissues and blood specimens from endemic areas are outlined. Ultimately, the importance of ongoing surveillance is emphasized, as the future of heart transplant recipients with Chagas disease is unpredictable and the presence or reactivation of the disease requires prompt attention in an effort to prevent graft failure and death.
