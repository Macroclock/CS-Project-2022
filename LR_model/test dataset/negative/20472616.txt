Left ventricular assist devices: an evolving state of the art. Heart failure is a disease of increasing prevalence around the world. The treatment options for patients suffering from this ailment range from pharmacologic to surgical. Heart failure, however, continues to harbor a dismal prognosis despite conventional treatments. The high mortality rate among this patient population has spawned interest in alternative therapies. Mechanical circulatory support has emerged as a treatment option for patients with refractory heart failure. Over the past years a number of studies have highlighted the effectiveness of left ventricular assist devices (LVAD's) in improving patient's outcomes. The technologies that support these devices have evolved and provide new opportunities to manage patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Heart transplantation continues to generate the most reproducible survival benefit to patients with advanced heart failure, but is limited by a lack of donors. It is therefore the goal of mechanical assist therapy to improve patient survival and quality of life in heart failure in light of the limitations of heart transplantation. In this article we examine the evolving utility of LVAD's in the treatment of heart failure.
