Total ischemia time alters the longitudinal and circumferential shortening of the right ventricle in transplanted hearts. Ischemia time is a risk factor for mortality and right ventricular (RV) failure after heart transplantation. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of ischemia time on known transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) parameters of RV function and on a novel quantitative measurement of RV circumferential shortening. Right and left ventricular (LV) function was evaluated retrospectively in 20 consecutive patients after heart transplant using known TEE parameters as well as a quantitative measurement of circumferential contraction. The control group consisted of 20 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with no documented RV dysfunction. Posttransplant TEE parameters of RV function were depressed compared with post-cardiopulmonary bypass CABG patients. Significant correlation was observed between tricuspid annular planar systolic excursion, basal, mid, and global circumferential shortening and total ischemia time. Total ischemia time of the transplanted heart may play a role in deterioration of longitudinal and circumferential shortening of the RV.
