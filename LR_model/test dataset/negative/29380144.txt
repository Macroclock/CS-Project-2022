Contemporary Perspectives in Durable Mechanical Circulatory Support: What Did We Learn in the Last 3 Years? In this paper, we will review developments in the field of durable mechanical circulatory support over the past 3 years. The role of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement in non-inotrope-dependent ambulatory heart failure patients remains controversial in light of recent clinical trials. New devices are on the horizon for destination therapy in advanced heart failure patients. The concept of hemocompatibility and the calculation of hemocompatibility scores represent a novel approach to common adverse events. Recent research in mechanical circulatory support has impacted our approach to durable LVAD therapy and set the stage for further advancements in the field.
