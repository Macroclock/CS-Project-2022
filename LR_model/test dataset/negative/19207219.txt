Percutaneous coronary intervention using drug-eluting stents in pediatric heart transplant recipients. PCI has been used for palliation of CAV in adults, but there are limited data available in children. We sought to evaluate our experience with PCIs for CAV in pediatric heart transplant recipients. Retrospective review of the medical records of all four patients who were diagnosed with CAV, including demographic data and catheterization reports was performed. Of the 149 pediatric heart transplant recipients followed at our institution, 10 were identified with CAV. Four of these 10 underwent 12 PCI procedures for CAV. One donor heart had documented coronary artery disease. Two patients had significant risk factors for coronary artery disease including morbid obesity, hyperlipidemia, and systemic hypertension. PCI involved deployment of bare metal stents (n = 2), paclitaxel-eluting stent (n = 6), and sirolimus-eluting stents (n = 4) with procedural success in all and no early or late mortality. One procedure was complicated by coronary dissection that was successfully treated with stent placement. One patient has been re-transplanted while the other three are not candidates for re-transplantation and have remained asymptomatic as palliation with PCI. PCI using coronary stents is a safe and effective palliative measure for CAV in pediatric heart transplant recipients.
