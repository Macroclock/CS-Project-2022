Young woman with breast cancer and cardiotoxicity with severe heart failure treated with a HeartMate IITM for nearly 6 years before heart transplantation. Cardiotoxicity is a multifactorial problem, which has emerged with the improvement of cancer therapies and survival. Heart transplantation is relatively contraindicated in patients with breast cancer, until at least 5 years after complete remission. We present a case where a young woman who in 2001, at the age of 31, was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was considered cured, but 4 years later she suffered a relapse. During her second treatment, in 2006, she suffered from severe heart failure. She received a HeartMate II, as a long-term bridge to transplantation and 6 years later she was successfully transplanted. In this case report we discuss the use of mechanical circulatory support in cancer patients with drug-induced heart failure.
