Fulminant hepatic failure due to varicella zoster in a heart transplant patient: successful liver transplant. Fulminant hepatic failure is a rare complication of infection by varicella zoster virus that is favored by immunosuppression. Within 1 week, a 43-year-old male heart transplant recipient who was admitted with epigastric pain successively developed a generalized vesicular rash, hepatitis, and secondary multiorganic failure involving encephalopathy, despite treatment with acyclovir (since Day 2) and varicella zoster virus immunoglobulin (since Day 6). Emergency liver transplantation was performed on Day 9, and 36 months later, his heart and liver function are normal.
