Kidney transplantation in valvular heart disease and pulmonary hypertension: Consensus in waiting. Kidney transplantation induces a lesser anesthetic, surgical, and physiological alterations than other solid organ transplantation. Concomitant valvular pathologies expose these patients to poor postoperative outcome. There is a critical gap in knowledge and lack of coherence in the guidelines related to the management in patients with end-stage renal disease with valvular heart disease. The individualized diagnostic and management plan should be based on the assessment of perioperative outcomes. Similarly, pulmonary hypertension in end-stage renal disease poses a unique challenge, it can manifest in isolation or may be associated with other cardiac lesions, namely left-sided valvular heart disease and left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Quantification and stratification according to etiology are needed in pulmonary hypertension to ensure an adequate management plan to minimize the adverse perioperative outcomes. Lack of randomized controlled trials has imposed hindrance in proposing a unified approach to clinical decision-making in these scenarios. In this review, we have described the magnitude of the problems, pathophysiologic interactions, impact on clinical outcomes and have also proposed a management algorithm for both the scenarios.
