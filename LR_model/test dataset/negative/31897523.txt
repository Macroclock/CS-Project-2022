Spontaneous "Coronary Bypass" in a Paediatric Transplanted Heart. We report an asymptomatic 5-year-old boy with coronary artery fistulas to pulmonary parenchyma and to systemic thoracic arteries, like a "natural bypass", detected during a coronary angiography performed 11Â months after his heart transplant. One year later, a new coronary angiography showed no fistula. Some changes to immunosuppressive therapy during this time could be related to this evolution.
