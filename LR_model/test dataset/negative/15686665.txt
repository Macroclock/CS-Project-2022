The role of antioxidant supplementation in cardiac transplantation: an experimental study in rats. We investigated three antioxidants, inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT), using a Langendorf model of heart transplantation. Rat hearts were mounted on a Langendorf perfusion apparatus with addition of IP6, SOD+CAT, IP6+SOD+CAT to St. Thomas Hospital solution (n=6 for each) versus a control group (n=6), not containing supplementation. Global ischemia was achieved for 6 hours. The worst peak-to-peak (PP) and +dp/dt maximum values were observed in the IP6+SOD+CAT group, the values being significantly lower than those in the SOD+CAT group. The lowest plasma creatine kinase (CK), CK-muscle-band (CK-MB), and lactate dehydrogenase levels were measured from the SOD+CAT group. The highest values for CK were in the control group, and those for CK-MB were in the IP6 group. The lowest myocardial malondialdehyde and adenosine triphosphate values were observed in the SOD+CAT group. Supplementing St. Thomas Hospital solution with IP6 did not ameliorate myocardial damage following global ischemia. The contractility deteriorated further when IP6+SOD+CAT were used together; however, SOD+CAT improved cardiac mechanical functions, and significantly reduced myocardial damage.
