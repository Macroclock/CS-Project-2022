Validation of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance-Derived Equation for Predicted Left Ventricular Mass Using the UK Biobank Imaging Cohort: Tool for Donor-Recipient Size Matching. Current guidance from International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation recommends using body weight for donor-recipient size matching for heart transplantation. However, recent studies have shown that predicted heart mass, using body weight, height, age, and sex, may represent a better method of size matching. We aim to validate a cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)-derived equation for predicted left ventricular mass (LVM) in a cohort of normal individuals in the United Kingdom. This observational study was conducted in 5065 middle-aged (44-77 years old) UK Biobank participants who underwent CMR imaging in 2014 to 2015. Individuals with cancer diagnosis in the previous 12 months or history of cardiovascular disease were excluded. Predicted LVM was calculated based on participants' sex, height, and weight recorded at the time of imaging. Correlation analyses were performed between the predicted LVM and the LVM obtained from manual contouring of CMR cine images. The analysis included 3398 participants (age 61.5±7.5 years, 47.8% males). Predicted LVM was considerably higher than CMR-derived LVM (mean±SD of 138.8±28.9 g versus 86.3±20.9 g). However, there was a strong correlation between the 2 measurements (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.802,  Predicted LVM calculated using a CMR-derived equation that incorporates height, weight, and sex has a strong correlation with CMR LVM in large cohort of normal individuals in the United Kingdom. Our findings suggest that predicted heart mass equations may be a valid tool for donor-recipient size matching for heart transplantation in the United Kingdom.
