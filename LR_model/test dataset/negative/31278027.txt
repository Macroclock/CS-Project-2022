Rationale and design of the optical coherence tomography observation of pulmonary ultra-structural changes in heart failure (OCTOPUS-CHF) study. The assessment of vascular remodeling using optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been previously described in some types of pulmonary hypertension. However, evidence about its feasibility and clinical utility for evaluation of pulmonary arterial vasculopathy in advanced heart failure (HF) is scarce. Optical Coherence Tomography Observation of Pulmonary Ultra-Structural Changes in Heart Failure (OCTOPUS-CHF) study is designed to study the correlation between OCT-morphometric parameters and hemodynamic data measured or derived from right heart catheterization (RHC). OCTOPUS-CHF is an observational, prospective, multicentre study aiming to recruit 100 patients with advanced HF referred for heart transplantation (HTx) evaluation. As part of such evaluation, all patients will undergo RHC in order to rule out severe pulmonary hypertension. After RHC, a Dragonfly™ OPTIS™ imaging catheter will be used to perform OCT evaluation of a right-lower-lobe pulmonary artery with a luminal diameter ≤ 5 mm. The primary objective is to study the correlation of OCT parameters with hemodynamic RHC data. The secondary objective is to determine if OCT parameters improve prognostic stratification. The OCTOPUS-CHF study will investigate the feasibility and clinical utility of pulmonary arterial vasculopathy evaluation with OCT in advanced HF patients and its correlation with hemodynamic RHC data. The ability of OCT-morphometric parameters to improve prognostic stratification will also be tested. 'Advanced heart failure', 'Optical coherence tomography', 'Pulmonary arterial remodeling'
