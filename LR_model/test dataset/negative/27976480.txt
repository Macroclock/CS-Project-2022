Social framework of pediatric heart recipients who have survived more than 15 post-transplant years: A single-center experience. To evaluate social development of pediatric heart transplant (tx) recipients who have lived 15 or more years after transplantation. Among 498 pediatric patients, age less than 18 years, who underwent heart transplantation, at a single institution, 337 were performed between 1985 and 1998. We identified all who survived more than 15 years and engaged them in a survey regarding employment, education, marital, and social status. One hundred and eighty-three recipients (54.3%; 183/337) have survived greater than 15 years; of these, 150 (81.9%) subjects are alive with age ranging from 15.04 from 28 years (median, 23.6 years). Forty-two patients (23%) are independent, 127 (69%) were living at home, and 14 (8%) have been lost to follow-up. Ninety-nine survivors (66%) responded to the survey study. Currently, five recipients are married. Seventy-four completed high school, 21 are enrolled in high school, and four did not complete high school. Of the 47 recipients who started college, 27 are currently enrolled, 11 graduated, and nine did not finish college. Ninety-four patients have health insurance, 40 are employed, and 31 receive financial assistance for a disability. The majority of recipients of pediatric heart transplantation are able to reach reasonable academic milestones, achieve social well-being, and professional independence.
