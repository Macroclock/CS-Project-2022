Airbag trauma induced cutaneous fistulae in a heart transplant patient. In recent years, trauma resulting from airbag inflation has been reported to cause skin injuries. These include minor abrasions and lacerations, chemical and thermal burns, and irritant dermatitis. We report what we believe to be the first case of airbag related cutaneous fistulae in a heart transplant patient. We believe that the increasing frequency of placement of subcutaneous and relatively superficial appliances in transplant and other surgical patients will result in an increasing frequency of similar injuries. Dermatologists may be uniquely suited to identify and treat such cutaneous trauma.
