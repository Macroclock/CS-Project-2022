C-reactive protein: the harbinger of cardiovascular diseases. Coronary heart disease remains the major cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States and other western countries despite major advances in its treatment. During the last decades, many markers of coronary artery disease have been found which help predict future risk of cardiovascular events. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein has been studied extensively and was seen to be associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes and/or peripheral artery disease. Discussed in this review is the latest literature about this marker and its association with cardiovascular disease, as well as the latest therapeutic options available.
