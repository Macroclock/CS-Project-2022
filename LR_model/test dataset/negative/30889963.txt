Bioengineering approaches to organ preservation ex vivo. Over the past several decades, ex vivo perfusion has emerged as a promising technology for the assessment, preservation, and recovery of donor organs. Many exciting pre-clinical findings have now been translated to clinical use, and successful transplantation following ex vivo perfusion has been achieved for heart, lung, and liver. While machine perfusion provides distinct advantages over traditional cold preservation, many challenges remain, including that of long-term (multi-day) ex vivo support. Here, we provide an overview of the current status of ex vivo machine perfusion in the pre-clinical and clinical setting and share our perspective on the future direction of the field.
