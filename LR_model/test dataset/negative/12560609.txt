[History of Lithuanian heart surgery]. The aim of the article is to review Lithuanian cardiac surgery development, as well as authors and timing of the first operations performed. Historical review involves two periods: initial (1900-1964) and contemporal (1964-2002). Benevolent rivalry between Vilnius and Kaunas heart surgeons is given to show their contribution into Lithuanian surgery. Chronological development and amelioration of the main heart surgery fields are described: heart injuries, ischemic heart disease, congenital and acquired defects, heart rhythm disturbances, heart transplantation.
