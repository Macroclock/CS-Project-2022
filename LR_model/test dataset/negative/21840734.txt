Safety and efficacy of early aggressive versus cholesterol-driven lipid-lowering strategies in heart transplantation: a pilot, randomized, intravascular ultrasound study. Statins are recommended in heart transplantation regardless of lipid levels. However, it remains unknown whether dosing should be maximized or adjusted toward a pre-defined cholesterol threshold. This pilot, randomized, open-label study compares an early maximal dose of fluvastatin (80 mg/day) with a strategy based on 20 mg/day subsequently titrated to target low-density lipoproteins (LDL) <100 mg/dl. Efficacy outcomes consisted of achieving an LDL level of <100 mg/dl at 12 months after transplant, and change in intracoronary ultrasound parameters. Fifty-two patients were randomized. Overall safety, and efficacy in achieving LDL targets (13 [50%] vs 14 [54%]; p = 0.8) were comparable between study arms, but 17 (65%) patients needed a dose increase in the titrated-dosing arm. Early LDL levels and average LDL burden were lower in the maximal-dosing arm (p < 0.05). Few patients developed an increase in maximal intimal thickness of >0.5 mm, with numerical prevalence in the titrated-dosing arm (3 [12.5%] vs 1 [5%]; p = 0.3). Intimal volume increased in the titrated-dosing (p < 0.01) but not in the maximal-dosing arm (p = 0.1), which accordingly showed a higher prevalence of negative remodeling (p = 0.02). Despite being as effective as the titrated-dosing approach in achieving LDL <100 mg/dl at 12 months after transplant, the maximal-dose approach was associated with a more rapid effect and with potential advantages in preventing pathologic changes in graft coronary arteries.
