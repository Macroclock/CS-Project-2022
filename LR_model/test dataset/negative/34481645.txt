Calcineurin-Inhibitor Induced Pain Syndrome in a Heart Transplant Patient. Calcineurin-inhibitor induced pain syndrome (CIPS) also called the "symmetrical bone syndrome" is a condition describing reversible lower extremity pain in patients after organ transplantation who are receiving calcineurin inhibitors, especially tacrolimus. We present a case of CIPS after orthotopic heart transplant complicated with concurrent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We emphasize the presentation; diagnostic evaluation, and findings. We then discuss the proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms of CIPS and conclude with discussion of management strategies. Additionally, we present a table to guide clinicians in assessing posttransplant bone pain syndromes. To our knowledge, this is the first article to describe a case of CIPS with concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
