Evidence supporting total cardiac volumes instead of weight for transplant size-matching. Total cardiac volume (TCV)-based size matching for heart transplantation offers individualization in size matching that increases the number of suitable donors. Here we describe our clinical protocol for using TCV to determine an acceptable donor weight range for heart transplant candidates. We compare candidate imaging-derived TCV to a nomogram of subjects with normal TCV to determine a precise maximum donor weight at the time of listing. For nearly half of our transplant patients, we have increased weight range by an average of 70% with no oversizing related adverse events, such as delayed chest closure to avoid tamponade or bronchial compression. Widespread adoption of TCV-based size matching can lead to a more efficient heart allocation system by the data-driven bypass of poor size matches.
