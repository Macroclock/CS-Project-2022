Neighborhood Socioeconomic Status and Outcomes Following the Norwood Procedure: An Analysis of the Pediatric Heart Network Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial Public Data Set. Children with single ventricle heart disease require frequent interventions and follow-up. Low socioeconomic status (SES) may limit access to high-quality care and place these children at risk for poor long-term outcomes. Data from the SVR (Pediatric Heart Network Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial Public Use) data set were used to examine the relationship of US neighborhood SES with 30-day and 1-year mortality or cardiac transplantation and length of stay among neonates undergoing the Norwood procedure (n=525). Crude rates of death or transplantation at 1Â year after Norwood were highest for patients living in neighborhoods with low SES (lowest tertile 37.0% versus middle tertile 31.0% versus highest tertile 23.6%,  Low neighborhood SES is associated with worse 1-year transplant-free survival after the Norwood procedure, suggesting that socioeconomic and environmental factors may be important determinants of outcome in critical congenital heart disease. Future studies should investigate aspects of SES and environment amenable to intervention. URL:http://www.clinicaltrials.gov> http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT00115934.
