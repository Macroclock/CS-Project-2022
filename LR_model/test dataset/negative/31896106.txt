Rapid Complete Response to Single-Agent Bcl-2 Inhibitor Venetoclax in a Heart-Transplanted Patient with Triple Refractory Immunoglobulin Light-Chain Amyloidosis. Immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis (AL) is a disease with limited treatment options due to the frailty of patients caused by organ damage. Since the clonal plasma cells often contain the cytogenetic aberration t(11;14), the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax is suggested to have a role in the treatment of AL. Here, we report of a heart-transplanted patient, refractory to multiple therapies, reaching a rapid complete response with single-agent venetoclax.
