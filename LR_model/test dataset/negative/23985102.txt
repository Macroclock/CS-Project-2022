Heart failure and mechanical circulatory assist devices. During the last 20 years, the management of heart failure has significantly improved by means of new pharmacotherapies, more timely invasive treatments and device assisted therapies. Indeed, advances in mechanical support, namely with the development of more efficient left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), and the total artificial heart have reduced mortality and morbidity in patients with end-stage heart failure awaiting for transplantation. However, the transplant cannot be the only solution, due to an insufficient number of available donors, but also because of the high number of patients who are not candidates for severe comorbidities or advanced age. New perspectives are emerging in which the VAD is no longer conceived only as a "Bridge to Transplant", but is now seen as a destination therapy. In this review, the main VAD classification, current basic indications, functioning modalities, main limitations of surgical VAD and the total artificial heart development are described.
