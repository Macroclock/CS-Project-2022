Continuous flow left ventricular assist device implantation concomitant with aortic arch replacement and aortic valve closure in a patient with end-stage heart failure associated with bicuspid aortic valve. Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation has become an established treatment for patients with end-stage heart failure as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. During LVAD implantation, some patients require concomitant surgeries, including tricuspid valve repair, aortic valve repair or replacement, and patent foramen ovale closure. However, concomitant aortic surgeries are rare in patients requiring LVAD implantation. We successfully performed total arch replacement with an open distal technique, aortic valve closure, and continuous flow LVAD implantation simultaneously.
