Exchange transfusion during extra corporeal membrane oxygenation used as a bridge to ABO-mismatch cardiac transplantation. We report a case in which exchange transfusion was performed directly from the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit in a child being bridged to cardiac transplantation. This allowed preparation for ABO-mismatched heart transplant in a child dependent on extracorporeal support, awaiting a suitable ABO-matched donor. Exchange transfusion or plasmapheresis in this setting would normally be performed on cardiopulmonary bypass to allow exsanguinations under hypothermia immediately pre-transplant. This allows little time for depletion of isohemagglutinins, occasionally leading to prolonged bypass times. We believe our method to be a safe alternative, allowing ample time for immunological preparation for ABO-incompatible transplant.
