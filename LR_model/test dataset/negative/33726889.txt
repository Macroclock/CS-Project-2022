["Staghorn" heart. The pathology of the explanted heart of a patient with clinical diagnosis and genetic variants of non-compacted myocardiopathy]. Non-compacted myocardiopathy is rare, the prevalence ranging between 0.01-0.26%. in adults. We present the macroscopic, microscopic and electron microscopy findings of cardiac transplant samples from a 36-year-old patient diagnosed with non-compacted myocardiopathy. This condition shows a high genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, with superposition of different phenotypes and variability in the hereditary patterns. Clinical diagnosis is established by coupling imaging results to clinical characteristics. The clinical manifestations of non-compacted myocardiopathy are variable, including arrhythmic events and variable degrees of cardiac failure, although some patients may be asymptomatic. In certain cases a heart transplant may be necessary. The differential diagnosis should be made with hypertrophic and dilated myocardiopathy. However, only a few reports can be found in the literature that discuss the pathology of this condition.
