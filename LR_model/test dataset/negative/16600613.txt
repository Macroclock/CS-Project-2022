Cardiac transplantation following ACORN CorCap device implantation. Passive ventricular restraint devices, such as the ACORN CorCap, have been introduced as a potential therapy for congestive heart failure (CHF). These mesh devices act as a mechanical support for the dilated heart. Due to incorporation of the device to the epicardium, concerns about the feasibility of reoperation following CorCap placement have been raised. This case illustrates that although technically challenging, reoperation for heart transplantation after CorCap implantation is feasible and safe.
