Usefulness of dual imaging stress echocardiography for the diagnosis of coronary allograft vasculopathy in heart transplant recipients. Coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the main factor limiting long-term survival after cardiac transplantation. Dual imaging stress echocardiography with wall motion and Doppler-derived coronary flow reserve (CRF) of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) is a state-of-the-art methodology during dipyridamole stress echocardiography (DiSE). This study involving 74 heart transplanted patients has the purpose to assess the diagnostic value of dipyridamole stress echocardiography with evaluation of wall motion (WM) and Doppler-derived coronary flow reserve for the diagnosis of coronary allograft vasculopathy. All patients underwent DiSE and coronary angiography. Moderate-severe CAV was defined according to International Society of Heart and Lung Transplant (ISHLT) recommended nomenclature for CAV, and CFR < 2 was considered to be impaired. Moderate-severe CAV was present in 11 patients. WM analysis revealed four patients (5%) with rest WM abnormalities. CFR analysis revealed that 40 (54%) individuals had an abnormal result. The combined evaluation of WM analysis and CFR resulted in a sensitivity of 72.7% (95% CI: 39.3 to 92.6%), a specificity of 49.2% (95% CI: 36.5 to 61.9%), a positive predictive value of 20% (95% CI: 9.6 to 36.1%), and negative predictive value of 91.1% (95% CI: 75.1 to 97.6%) for the diagnosis of CAV. Our results support the inclusion of DiSE performance in Heart transplant follow up protocol. The addition of CFR evaluation offers valuable information to the angiography findings in the detection of CAV and could be helpful in selected patients to adjust the time and indications of coronary angiography.
