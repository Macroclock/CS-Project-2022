Cutaneous alternariosis with trichosporon infection in a heart transplant recipient: a case report. Cutaneous alternariosis infection occurs mainly in immunocompromised individuals. The incidence of alternariosis in a heart transplant recipient is infrequent. Coincidence of the aforementioned infection with additional fugal agents is rare. We describe a case of alternariosis with Trichosporon fungal infection in a patient who was successfully treated with combined antifungal therapy, modulation of immunosuppressive regimen, and blood glucose management. The patient had a good response to treatment, and has had an uneventful 1-year follow-up at the time of this writing.
