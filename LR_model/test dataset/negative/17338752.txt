Repeated paracentesis for treatment renal failure after heart transplantation in patient with ascites. We report a case of orthotopic heart transplantation in a 42-year-old man who had cardiomyopathy with severe biventricular heart failure, ascites, and large umbilical hernia. He successfully received an orthotopic heart transplantation. After heart transplantation, renal failure was noted. Ascites and renal failure were successfully managed with repeated paracentesis. His cardiac and abdominal symptoms subsided gradually following transplantation. His umbilical hernia was repaired 55 days after the heart transplantation because of strangulation. In this case study, we report a patient with ascites who was treated for postoperative renal failure with repeated paracentesis.
