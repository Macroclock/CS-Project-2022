B cell clonal expansion within immune infiltrates in human cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is associated with intragraft B cell infiltrates. Here, we studied the clonal composition of B cell infiltrates using 4 graft specimens with CAV. Using deep sequencing, we analyzed the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region repertoire in both graft and blood. Results showed robust B cell clonal expansion in the graft but not in the blood for all cases. Several expanded B cell clones, characterized by their uniquely rearranged complementarity-determining region 3, were detected in different locations in the graft. Sequences from intragraft B cells also showed elevated levels of mutated rearrangements in the graft compared to blood B cells. The number of somatic mutations per rearrangement was also higher in the graft than in the blood, suggesting that B cells continued maturing in situ. Overall, our studies demonstrated B cell clonal expansion in human cardiac allografts with CAV. This local B cell response may contribute to the pathophysiology of CAV through a mechanism that needs to be identified.
