Radiofrequency ablation of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia in an orthotopic heart transplantation patient. Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) after orthotropic heart transplant (OHT) is rare, in absence of rejection. We report a case of a 51-year-old male who underwent simultaneous kidney and heart transplant. Three months after implantation he developed episodes of dyspnea, dizziness, and palpitations. Presenting electrocardiogram showed supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and an inducible typical AVNRT was revealed by electrophysiologic study. Radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation successfully eliminated the AVNRT without any complications. Even with existing sinus rhythm of the donor heart, AVNRT can occur in transplanted heart and RF catheter ablation is safe and feasible at treating symptomatic SVT post-OHT.
