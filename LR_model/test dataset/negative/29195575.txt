Twenty-Five Year Outcomes of the Lateral Tunnel Fontan Procedure. The objective of this study was to characterize late outcomes of the lateral tunnel (LT) Fontan procedure. The outcomes of all patients who underwent an LT Fontan procedure in Australia and in New Zealand were analyzed. Original files were reviewed and outcomes data were obtained through a binational registry. Between 1980 and 2014, a total of 301 patients underwent an LT Fontan procedure across 6 major centers. There were 13 hospital mortalities, 21 late deaths, 8 Fontan conversions and revisions, 8 Fontan takedowns, and 4 heart transplantations. Overall survival at 15 and 25 years was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 86%-93%) and 80% (95% CI: 69%-91%), respectively. Protein-losing enteropathy or plastic bronchitis was observed in 14 patients (5%). Freedom from late failure at 15 and 25 years was 88% (95% CI: 84%-92%) and 82% (95% CI: 76%-87%), respectively. Independent predictors of late Fontan failure were prolonged pleural effusions post Fontan operations (hazard ratio [HR] 3.06, 1.05-8.95, P = 0.041), age >7 years at Fontan (vs 3-5 years, HR 9.7, 2.46-38.21, P = 0.001) and development of supraventricular tachycardia (HR 4.67, 2.07-10.58, P < 0.001). Freedom from tachy- or bradyarrhythmias at 10 and 20 years was 87% (95% CI: 83%-91%) and 72% (95% CI: 66%-79%), respectively. Thromboembolic events occurred in 45 patients (16%, 26 strokes), and freedom from symptomatic thromboembolism at 10 and 20 years was 93% (95% CI: 89%-96%) and 80% (95% CI: 74%-86%), respectively. Over a 25-year period, the LT technique has achieved excellent late survival. As this population ages, it is at an increasing risk of failure and adverse events. We are likely to see an increasing proportion requiring heart transplantation and late reintervention.
