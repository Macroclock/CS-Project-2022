Therapy for acute rejection in pediatric organ transplant recipients. Despite the availability of potent immunosuppressive drugs, rejection after organ transplantation in children remains a serious concern, and may lead to significant morbidity, graft loss, and death of the patient. Acute graft rejection in pediatric recipients is first treated with methylprednisolone pulses, followed by progressive taper of corticosteroid doses. After control of the rejection episode, baseline immunosuppression has to be adjusted and closely monitored since rejection (especially late episodes, occurring more than 6 months after transplantation) may be due to a lack of compliance or sub-therapeutic drug concentrations. The management of corticosteroid resistant rejection is not standardized, and depends on the transplanted organ and previous immunosuppressive regimen. In patients experiencing corticosteroid resistant acute rejection while on a cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive regimen, cyclosporine is generally changed to tacrolimus. In case of tacrolimus-based immunosuppression, tacrolimus blood levels may be increased, and/or mycophenolate mofetil (which nowadays tends to replace azathioprine) or sirolimus may be added, although pharmacodynamic data and clinical studies with these agents are still scarce in pediatric recipients. The use of antithymocyte globulins or monoclonal anti-CD3 antibodies, muromonab CD3 (OKT3) is hampered by numerous adverse effects, including a significant risk of over-immunosuppression. These therapies are nowadays indicated in very selected cases. Other treatments such as plasmapheresis and high dose immunoglobulins may be useful in difficult cases. In patients with refractory rejection despite therapeutic escalation, the risks of over-immunosuppression, including opportunistic infections and malignancies (especially the Epstein-Barr virus related post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease) have to be balanced with the consequences of graft loss due to rejection. Detransplantation or retransplantation may, in some instances, be preferable to severe infectious or tumoral complications.
