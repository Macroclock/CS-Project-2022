This article reviews take-home messages from the 7th BSH HF revalidation and training meeting. It emphasises what every physician needs to know about the latest acute HF guidelines, diagnostics in HF, management strategies (including pharmacotherapeutics and device therapy), and when to consider referring to a transplant centre for mechanical circulatory support or transplantation.
