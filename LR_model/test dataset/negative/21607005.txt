[Heart recruiment of elderly donors by pharmacological echostress]. The heart transplant is a treatment of the heart failure, which is not responding to medications. To counteract heart donor shortage, we should screen aged potential donor hearts for initial cardiomyopathy and functionally significant coronary artery disease, in order to exclude donors with a history of cardiac disease. A simple way to evaluate this should be stress echocardiography. A marginal donor (a 57 year old woman meeting legal requirements for brain death) underwent a transesophageal (TE) dipyridamole stress echo (6 minutes accelerated protocol) to rule out moderate or severe heart and coronary artery disease. Wall motion was normal at baseline and at peak stress, without signs of stress inducible ischemia, and there was no latent myocardial dysfunction. The marginal donor heart was transplanted to a recipient marginal for co-morbidity (a 63 year old man with multiple myeloma and cardiac amyloidosis , chronic severe heart failure, NYHA class IV). The transplanted heart was assessed normal for dimensions and ventricular function at transthoracic (TT) echocardiography on post-transplant day 7. Coronary artery disease was ruled out at coronary angiography one month after transplant. For the first time stress echo was successfully used for the selection of hearts "too good to die", representing a critical way to solve the mismatch between donor need and supply.
