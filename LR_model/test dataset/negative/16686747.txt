Contemporary concepts in prevention and treatment of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), is characterized by heterogeneous proliferative thickening of the vascular intima of the cardiac allograft vasculature. Since its presentation is commonly clinically silent, early diagnosis and preventative therapy are critical. Preventative therapy including optimization of immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of comorbidities associated with CAV progression must be initiated early since most of the intimal thickening occurs during the first year posttransplant. Long-term use of calcineurin inhibitors is associated with a high incidence of chronic renal disease and also contributes to hyperlipidemia and hypertension, all of which may exacerbate CAV. In addition, statins, antihypertensive agents and anti-CMV agents all have demonstrated benefits in reducing CAV. Once established, the limited treatment options include nonpharmacologic interventions such as retransplantation, percutaneous coronary interventions, coronary artery bypass grafting, transmyocardial laser revascularization and heparin-induced/mediated extracorporeal LDL plasmapheresis (HELP). As the use of new assessment tools increases our understanding of this disease, better preventative and treatment strategies are evolving.
