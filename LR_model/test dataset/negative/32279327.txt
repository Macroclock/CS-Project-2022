Evolution of pediatric ventricular assist devices and their neurologic and renal complications-A 24-year single-center experience. Utilization of ventricular assist devices (VADs) in adult populations with severe heart failure as a bridge to transplant has become the standard of care over the past two decades. Analogously, the use of VADs in pediatric populations has become more commonplace as pediatric heart transplantation has become more prevalent. We still have much to learn, however, about the complications after VAD placement in pediatric patients, their impact on transplantation and, in particular, how outcomes have changed over time. The objectives of this study were to (a) review the experience of a single pediatric VAD center, (b) identify risk factors that could lead to poor outcomes in patients on the transplant waitlist after VAD implantation and (c) demonstrate changes in outcomes over time. A retrospective cohort analysis was performed comparing death as a primary outcome and stroke and acute kidney injury (AKI) as secondary outcomes, across the study period divided into three timed eras. We analyzed 88 patients supported by a VAD over a 24-year timeframe. The duration, age at implant and indication for VAD support did not change significantly across the eras. We found that the incidence of stroke decreased over the study period and, while the rates of AKI did not change over the study period, those who developed AKI, while supported on VAD, had an increased risk of death.
