Saphenous vein graft flow during left ventricular assistance with an axial-flow pump. The effects of continuous-flow support on bypass graft flow have not been quantified clinically. Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices unload the left ventricle throughout the cardiac cycle, which narrows pulse pressure and converts passive left ventricular filling during diastole to active flow throughout the cardiac cycle. We report the case of a 63-year-old man with severe congestive heart failure who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and was supported with an axial-flow pump. In this patient, saphenous vein graft flow during left ventricular assistance provided adequate coronary perfusion.
