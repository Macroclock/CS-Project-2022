The effects of tolerance on allograft damage caused by the innate immune system. It is not known whether tolerance can be induced in a strong proinflammatory milieu or whether the induction of tolerance can prevent interferon (IFN)-gamma-associated graft injury. To address these questions, we studied the effects of rIFN-gamma infusion on porcine cardiac allograft survival. Recombinant interferon (rIFN)-gamma was continuously infused into the left anterior descending artery of hearts transplanted into major histocompatibility complex-inbred miniature swine treated with a 12-day course of cyclosporine A. Group 1 recipients received a nearly syngeneic heart, group 2 recipients received a class I disparate heart, and group 3 recipients were cotransplanted with a class I-disparate heart and kidney, a procedure demonstrated to induce tolerance to both grafts. A fourth group of animals were not transplanted but received intracoronary rIFN-gamma infusion into the native heart. rIFN-gamma perfusion not only accelerated the acute rejection of class I-disparate hearts (mean survival time, 19+/-7.21 vs. 38+/-8.19; P=0.025) but caused near-syngeneic heart transplants, which otherwise survived indefinitely, to reject within 35 days. In contrast, rIFN-gamma perfusion had no demonstrable effects on hearts grafts in tolerant recipients or on autologous hearts. These results suggest that tolerance induction can occur in the presence of IFN-gamma-mediated inflammation, and that tolerance induction can prevent the tissue injury caused by the overproduction of IFN-gamma. This suggests that the beneficial effects of tolerance may include protection from nonspecific inflammatory responses, such as those produced by ischemia-reperfusion injury and brain death.
