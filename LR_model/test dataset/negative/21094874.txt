Recurrent non-melanoma skin cancer: remission of field cancerization after conversion from calcineurin inhibitor- to proliferation signal inhibitor-based immunosuppression in a cardiac transplant recipient. Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) are the most common malignancies after solid organ transplantation. Their incidence increases with time after transplantation. Calcineurin-inhibitors (CNIs) and azathioprine are known as skin neoplasia-initiating and -enhancing immunosuppressants. In contrast, increasing clinical experience suggests a relevant antiproliferative effect of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, also named proliferation signal inhibitors (PSIs). We report the case of a cardiac allograft recipient with an impressive and consolidated reduction of recurrent NMSC, observed after conversion from CNI-therapy to a PSI-based protocol.
