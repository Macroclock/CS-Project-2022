A High-Fidelity, Tissue-Based Simulation for Cardiac Transplantation. Several operations in cardiothoracic surgery have been accurately modeled with tissue-based simulations. These have been shown to be beneficial in the training of residents. Cardiac transplantation has not been simulated. We describe a high-fidelity, tissue-based simulation that can be used to teach trainees to perform a cardiac transplant. We modified the existing Ramphal Cardiac Surgery Simulator to accommodate cardiac transplantation. An attending cardiac surgeon successfully performed the simulated transplant, demonstrating each of the component tasks of the operation. We believe our simulation will enhance the training of cardiothoracic surgery residents.
