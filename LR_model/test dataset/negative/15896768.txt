Ascending aortic aneurysm after pediatric heart transplantation: case report of an unusual complication. A 28-month-old boy, weighing 11 kg, with severe dilated cardiomyopathy, was transplanted on December 1995. Hypertension and supraventricular tachycardia were detected in the immediate post-operative period, with favorable outcome. After 5 months of clinically asymptomatic follow-up, a dilation in the ascending aorta was observed on routine echocardiogram. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI) confirmed an ascending aortic aneurysm, with a diameter of 38 mm. An operation was performed, a bovine pericardium patch was sutured with reconstruction of the aortic wall, excluding the aneurysm. Good recovery was obtained and the child was discharged on Day 7 postoperatively. A post-operative echocardiogram showed absence of the aortic aneurysm and good surgical results. Another NMRI was done 5 months later, showing an intact ascending aorta. After 64 months, the patients clinical condition was confirmed as normal by echocardiogram. Surgical treatment was successful and the positive results have been maintained.
