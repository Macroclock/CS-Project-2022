Minimally invasive biventricular mechanical circulatory support with Impella pumps as a bridge to heart transplantation: a first-in-the-world case report. Cardiogenic shock from biventricular failure that requires acute mechanical circulatory support carries high 30Â day mortality. Acute mechanical circulatory support can serve as bridge to orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) in selected patients. We report a patient with biventricular failure secondary to rapidly progressive cardiac sarcoidosis refractory to medical management who was bridged to OHT with Impella 5.0 and Impella RP-temporary left and right ventricular assist devices, respectively. This is the first successful bridge to transplantation using these devices in biventricular heart failure and cardiogenic shock. We discuss considerations for using this strategy over veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or surgically implanted assist devices in patients with cardiogenic shock and biventricular failure as a bridge to OHT.
