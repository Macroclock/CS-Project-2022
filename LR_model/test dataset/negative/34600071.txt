The effect of paracorporeal pulsatile biventricular assist devices on allosensitization in adults: A comparison with left ventricular assist devices. Ventricular assist devices (VADs) have been associated with the development of anti-HLA antibodies ('allosensitization'), but data on devices providing biventricular support in adults are limited. We sought to characterize differences in anti-HLA antibody formation in adult patients receiving left- (LVAD) versus biventricular- (BiVAD) assist devices as bridge to transplantation (BTT) by retrospectively reviewing the records of adult patients who have undergone VAD implantation at our institution. We assessed 82 patients supported with a pulsatile-flow paracorporeal BiVAD and compared them with 40 patients receiving LVAD till 2018. Forty-eight (58.5%) of the BiVAD and 23 (57.5%) of the LVAD patients were eventually transplanted (p = 0.91) with an average time to transplantation 559 and 598 days, respectively (p = 0.73). Evidence of sensitization pre-VAD was found in 11.0% of the BiVAD patients and 15.0% of the LVAD ones (p = 0.53); these percentages rose to 43.9% (p < 0.001) and 40.0% (p = 0.01), respectively. The post-VAD sensitization status was not significantly different between the BiVAD and the LVAD group (p = 0.68). De novo sensitization was comparable between the two groups (p = 0.55). Post-transplantation outcomes regarding rejections and cardiac allograft vasculopathy were also similar. Conclusively, BiVAD- and LVAD- induced allosensitization do not appear to differ significantly. 'Allosensitization', 'BiVAD', 'Heart transplantation', 'Ventricular assist devices'
