Commemorating 50 years since the first heart transplantation in Bratislava - Czechoslovakia. The first human-to-human heart transplantation in Czechoslovakia, and the 25th transplantation in the world, was performed in Bratislava, the second largest city in Czechoslovakia on July 9, 1968. The operation was carried out by a team led by Professors Karol Siska and Ladislav Kuzela at the second Surgical Clinic at the Comenius University of the Medical Faculty in Bratislava, Partizanska Street-only seven months after the first heart transplantation performed by Dr. Christiaan Barnard in Cape Town. Other members of the team in Bratislava included surgery recipients Siska, Kuzela, Pivkova, Holoman; surgery donors Schnorrer, Kuzela, Holoman; an extracorporeal circulation team of Treger, Carsky, Podolay; anesthesiologists Sobesky and Neumanova; operating room nurses Machkova, Homerova, Kralova, and operating room laboratory technician Malinova. The donor was P.V., a 46-year-old man, who suffered from a deadly brain trauma. The recipient was S.H., a 54-year-old woman with a failing heart, heavily affected diseased lungs, kidneys and liver. Her heart began to work, but lasted only for five hours. (Additional members of the team, Prof. Simkovic and Drs. Silvay and Sujansky were in the USA at the moment of transplantation, in Houston and New York, subsequently) (Tab. 1, Fig. 2, Ref. 62).
