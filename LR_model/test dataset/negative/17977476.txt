Mutations in the cardiac Troponin C gene are a cause of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in childhood. The role of familial disease in childhood dilated cardiomyopathy is unknown. A novel mutation in the cardiac Troponin C gene has been identified recently in a family with dilated cardiomyopathy. Here we present a subsequent case of dilated cardiomyopathy occurring in a child from the same family, and emphasise the implications for future screening and counselling.
