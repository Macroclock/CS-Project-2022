Diagnosis and clinical management of long-QT syndrome. To give an overview over the substantial advances in the diagnosis and management of Long-QT syndrome since its first description 60 years ago. LQT syndrome remains the most common inherited arrhythmia and is a leading cause for sudden unexplained death accounting for up to 20-25% of cases. Rapid progress of genetic technology over the past 2 decades has significantly improved our understanding of molecular and genetic mechanisms of LQT. Despite all those novel insights, phenotype assessment and appropriate risk stratification in LQT remains challenging - even for the expert. This review outlines our current understanding and approach to the clinical diagnosis and management of LQT as well as recent insights into genotype-phenotype correlations. Genetic testing has evolved beyond a pure diagnostic tool and is in addition increasingly integrated as complementary prognostic marker. With regard to the management of LQT, there is now evidence that the protective effect of beta-blockers is rather substance-specific than a class effect. Novel approaches - in conjunction with standard beta-blockers - are emerging including gene-specific treatment for certain subtypes of LQT. A specialized inherited arrhythmia clinic is the preferred resource for the complex risk stratification and individualized management of individuals with LQT.
