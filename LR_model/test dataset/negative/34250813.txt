Caregiver Health-Related Quality of Life, Burden, and Patient Outcomes in Ambulatory Advanced Heart Failure: A Report From REVIVAL. Background Heart failure (HF) imposes significant burden on patients and caregivers. Longitudinal data on caregiver health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and burden in ambulatory advanced HF are limited. Methods and Results Ambulatory patients with advanced HF (n=400) and their participating caregivers (n=95) enrolled in REVIVAL (Registry Evaluation of Vital Information for VADs [Ventricular Assist Devices] in Ambulatory Life) were followed up for 24Â months, or until patient death, left ventricular assist device implantation, heart transplantation, or loss to follow-up. Caregiver HRQOL (EuroQol Visual Analog Scale) and burden (Oberst Caregiving Burden Scale) did not change significantly from baseline to follow-up. At time of caregiver enrollment, better patient HRQOL by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire was associated with better caregiver HRQOL ( 'caregiving', 'heart failure', 'left ventricular assist device', 'quality of life'
