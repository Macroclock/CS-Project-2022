Microaxial Flow Left Ventricular Assist Device as a Bridge to Transplantation after LVAD Malfunction. Evolving technology and improvements in the design of modern, continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices have substantially reduced the rate of device malfunction. As the number of implanted devices increases and as survival prospects for patients with a device continue to improve, device malfunction is an increasingly common clinical challenge. Here, we present our initial experience with an endovascular microaxial flow left ventricular assist device as a successful bridge to transplantation in a 54-year-old man who experienced left ventricular assist device malfunction.
