Dual Procurement of Lung and Heart Allografts Does Not Negatively Affect Lung Transplant Outcomes. The data that exists regarding multiorgan procurement outcomes is conflicted. Given the increasing demand for pulmonary allografts, it is critical to assess the impact of dual procurement on lung transplant recipient outcomes. The United Network for Organ Sharing transplant registry was queried for all first-time adult (age ≥18) lung transplant recipients between 2006 and 2018 and stratified by concurrent heart donor status. Multiorgan transplant recipients and recipients with missing survival time were excluded. Donors were excluded if they were donating after circulatory death, did not consent or were not approached for heart donation, the heart was recovered for nontransplant purposes, or the heart was recovered for transplant but not transplanted. Post-transplant survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. A total of 18,641 recipients met inclusion criteria, including 6230 (33.4%) in the nonheart donor group (NHD) and 12,409 (66.6%) in the heart donor group (HD). HD recipients demonstrated longer survival at 10 years posttransplant, with a median survival of 6.5 years as compared with 5.9 years in NHD recipients. On adjusted analysis, HD and NHD recipients demonstrated comparable survival (AHR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90-1.01). Concomitant heart and lung procurement was not associated with worse survival. This finding encourages maximizing the number of organs procured from each donor, particularly in the setting of urgency-driven thoracic transplantation. 'Heart', 'Lung', 'Outcomes', 'Transplant'
