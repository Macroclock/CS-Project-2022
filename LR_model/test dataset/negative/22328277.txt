Safety of anidulafungin in solid organ transplant recipients. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the safety of anidulafungin in adult solid organ transplantation (SOT) recipients. During the study period (14 months), we included all consecutive SOT recipients from 14 centers who received anidulafungin for at least 48 hours for the treatment of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) or as prophylaxis. Relevant clinical and analytical information on clinical charts was reviewed. Clinical side effects, liver function tests, and serum creatinine levels were assessed at least weekly. The need for the modification of immunosuppressive drugs was also recorded by the investigators. All patients were followed for at least 1 week after the end of treatment (EOT) or until death. Eighty-six SOT recipients were evaluated (56 transplant recipients, 20 lung transplant recipients, 8 kidney transplant recipients, and 2 heart transplant recipients). Sixty-two patients (72%) received anidulafungin for prophylaxis, and 24 (28%) received anidulafungin for the treatment of IFIs [candidemia/invasive candidiasis (16) or invasive aspergillosis (8)]. At the baseline, only 5% of the patients were neutropenic (<500 neutrophils/mL). There was no need for the modification of immunosuppressive drug doses because of anidulafungin therapy. No patient discontinued anidulafungin because of severe adverse effects. While receiving anidulafungin, 1 patient developed mild liver toxicity, but the liver function normalized without the discontinuation of anidulafungin. At EOT, the median serum creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase levels were significantly lower than the baseline levels, even in liver transplant recipients and patients who had higher baseline levels of serum creatinine. In conclusion, these results show that anidulafungin is a well-tolerated drug in SOT recipients.
