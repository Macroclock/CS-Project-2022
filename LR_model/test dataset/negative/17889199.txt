Ezetimibe in heart transplantation: initial experience. Dyslipidemia is a common problem among heart transplant (HT) recipients; it is a frequent risk factor in these patients that is exacerbated by immunosuppressive drugs. Statins are effective drugs to treat dyslipidemia in HT recipients, but control is suboptimal in some patients. Ezetimibe acts through inhibition of the enterohepatic recirculation, a mechanism different from but complementary to statins. Our objective was to assess the effect of the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy among a population of HT patients. We included 19 stable patients on statin therapy with suboptimal control of cholesterol. Determinations were performed at baseline on statins and at 6 months (statins + ezetimibe). The analyzed variables were total cholesterol and fractions, triglycerides, cyclosporine levels, CPK, SGOT/SGPT, and bilirubin. The statistics were Student's t test for paired samples. The overall mean age was 59 +/- 9 years with 95% males and mean BMI 27.5 +/- 3.5. The time since HT was 7 +/- 3 years. The reason for HT included ischemic heart disease in 68%. Pre-HT risk factors included in arterial hypertension in 32% and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in 10%, Dyslipidemia occurred in 68%; hypertriglyceridemia in 16% and hyperuricemia in 21%. Immunosuppression was cyclosporine in 100% and steroids in 94%. Type of lipid-lowering agent was simvastatin in 5%; pravastatin, 32%; atorvastatin, 58%; fibrates, 10%. The ezetimibe dose was 10 mg/day in 95% of cases. When ezetimibe was added we observed differences in total cholesterol values (total cholesterol at baseline: 279 +/- 74, total cholesterol with ezetimibe: 198 +/- 47 mg/dL; P = .0001) and LDL-cholesterol values (LDL-cholesterol at baseline: 171 +/- 69, LDL-cholesterol with ezetimibe: 109 +/- 41 mg/dL; P = .001). The remaining variables did not show significant differences. The addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy among heart transplant patients was effective to control dyslipidemia and showed an excellent safety profile.
