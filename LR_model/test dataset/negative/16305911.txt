Three cases of orthotopic heart transplantation for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a cardiomyopathy that primarily affects the heart muscle in the right ventricle. The ventricular muscle is replaced by fatty or fibrous tissue in a diffuse or spotty process. We performed orthotopic heart transplantations in 3 patients and all patients are alive. When ARVC has progressed to heart failure in the right or left ventricles, orthotopic heart transplantation is an effective therapeutic option.
