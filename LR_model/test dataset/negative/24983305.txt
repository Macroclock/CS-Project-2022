Time-dependent specificity of immunopathologic (C4d-CD68) and histologic criteria of antibody-mediated rejection for donor-specific antibodies and allograft dysfunction in heart transplantation. In heart transplantation, antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is diagnosed and graded on the basis of immunopathologic (C4d-CD68) and histopathologic criteria found on endomyocardial biopsies (EMB). Because some pathologic AMR (pAMR) grades may be associated with clinical AMR, and because humoral responses may be affected by the intensity of immunosuppression during the first posttransplantation year, we investigated the incidence and positive predictive values (PPV) of C4d-CD68 and pAMR grades for clinical AMR as a function of time. All 564 EMB from 40 adult heart recipients were graded for pAMR during the first posttransplantation year. Clinical AMR was diagnosed by simultaneous occurrence of pAMR on EMB, donor specific antibodies and allograft dysfunction. One patient demonstrated clinical AMR at postoperative day 7 and one at 6 months (1-year incidence 5%). C4d-CD68 was found on 4,7% EMB with a "decrescendo" pattern over time (7% during the first 4 months vs. 1.2% during the last 8 months; P < 0.05). Histopathologic criteria of AMR occurred on 10.3% EMB with no particular time pattern. Only the infrequent (1.4%) pAMR2 grade (simultaneous histopathologic and immunopathologic markers) was predictive for clinical AMR, particularly after the initial postoperative period (first 4 months and last 8 months PPV = 33%-100%; P < 0.05). In the first posttransplantation year, AMR immunopathologic and histopathologic markers were relatively frequent, but only their simultaneous occurrence (pAMR2) was predictive of clinical AMR. Furthermore, posttransplantation time may modulate the occurrence of C4d-CD68 on EMB and thus the incidence of pAMR2 and its relevance to the diagnosis of clinical AMR.
