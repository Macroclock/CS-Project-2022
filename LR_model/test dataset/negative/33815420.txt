Allograft or Recipient ST2 Deficiency Oppositely Affected Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy  The role of IL-33/ST2 signaling in cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is not fully addressed. Here, we investigated the role of IL-33/ST2 signaling in allograft or recipient in CAV respectively using MHC-mismatch murine chronic cardiac allograft rejection model. We found that recipients ST2 deficiency significantly exacerbated allograft vascular occlusion and fibrosis, accompanied by increased F4/80 'IL-33', 'ST2', 'cardiac allograft vasculopathy', 'chronic rejection', 'heart transplantation'
