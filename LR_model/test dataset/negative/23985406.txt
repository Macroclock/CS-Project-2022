[Clinical results of continuous-flow left ventricular assist device(LVAD) for severe heart failure patients]. Continuous-flow left ventricular assist device(LVAD)has undergone dramatic change into strategy of treating severe heart failure. In this report, we describe our clinical results and problems of continuous-flow LVAD and discuss the future strategy for heart failure patients. Twenty-nine heart failure patients (34.9Â±12.2 year-old, 20 male) underwent continuous-flow LVAD at Osaka University Hospital since approval of reimbursement of health insurance at 2010. The overall survival and the LVAD related complications were retrospectively evaluated in these 29 patients. The overall survival rate was 96% at 1 year and 96% at 2 years. Seven patients required right ventricular assist device (RVAD) including 3 patients converted to durable RVAD. Cerebrovascular complications was developed in 7 patients and 1 of the 7 patients died from hemorrhagic infarction. Device related infection was detected in only 1 patient with immunosuppressive therapy. The clinical results of continuous-flow LVAD were sufficient and the trend of recent increment of aging donor demands reconsideration of comprehensive strategy for severe heart failure.
