[Osteoporosis after solid organs transplantation]. Osteoporosis is a common complication following kidney, heart, liver and lung transplantation. Immunosuppressive regimens to prevent graft rejection after transplantation commonly include glucocorticoids, cyclosporin A and tacrolimus which are detrimental to bone and mineral homeostasis and are superimposed on an already compromised skeleton. Additional factors likely to contribute to post-transplantation osteoporosis pathogenesis are vitamin D insufficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism and hypogonadism. Measures should be taken to optimize bone health prior transplantation: bone mineral density and spinal X-rays should be performed, and vitamin D and gonadal status assessed. Prophylaxis against bone loss after transplantation should be considered for all patients. Data from clinical trials suggest that bisphosphonates are the most promising agents for the prevention and treatment of post-transplantation osteoporosis.
