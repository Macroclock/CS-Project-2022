Clinical and hemodynamic outcomes of the Dor procedure in adults with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Ischemic cardiomyopathy continues to be a major contributor to congestive heart failure, which places a significant burden on our healthcare system. Improving medications and different coronary revascularization strategies are the mainstays in the management of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Although medications and mechanical circulatory support are playing an ever-increasing role, cardiac transplantation remains the gold standard for treating advanced heart failure. Given the small number of available and suitable donor hearts, transplantation is limited for the majority of patients. Surgical ventricular restoration has repeatedly been suggested as a viable alternative in managing heart failure in select patients, as it is believed that surgically returning the ventricle to its original dimensions is possible and associated with favorable outcomes. The purpose of this manuscript is to comprehensively review the current literature on various surgical strategies for ventricular restoration. We also contextualize the published data with respect to ventricular function, volume, structure, arrhythmias, mitral regurgitation, and clinical outcomes.
