Acinetobacter mediastinitis in a heart transplant patient. We report a 56-year-old who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation following left ventricular assist device bridge to transplantation. His postoperative course was complicated by severe sternal wound infection with Acinetobacter species requiring extensive debridement and reconstruction with a pectoralis major flap. This was followed by a total sternectomy, pectoralis flap debridement, and vacuum-assisted dressing.
