Determinants of outcome after heterotopic heart transplantation. Donor availability is currently the major factor limiting the use of heart transplantation as a treatment for severe heart failure. Heterotopic heart transplantation may address this issue by allowing the use of smaller donor organs, which otherwise may not be used. We analyzed the outcome of 42 consecutive, adult heterotopic transplantations performed between 1993 and 1999 at our center and compared them with the 303 consecutive orthotopic transplants performed in adult patients during the same period. Univariate analysis showed a relative risk for death of 1.8 at 1 year after transplantation for the heterotopic group compared with the orthotopic transplantation group (p = 0.04). Multiple regression analysis using a proportional hazards model showed that donor-recipient size-mismatch, i.e., donor body surface area < or =75% of recipient body surface area (p = 0.0001), donor age (p = 0.0001), and use of a female donor (p = 0.04) were significant risk factors but heterotopic transplantation per se was not. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of heterotopic vs orthotopic transplantation showed that 30-day survival was 76% vs 87%. By 1 year, this was 59% vs 74%. At 3 years, the comparison was 56% vs 69%. Repeating this analysis after sub-dividing the heterotopic group into those size-matched vs size-mismatched, the 1-year survival was 81% vs 45%, respectively (p = 0.02). Heterotopic transplantation using a size-matched graft resulted in similar survival to that seen after orthotopic transplantation during the same period. Heterotopic transplantation with an undersized graft resulted in significantly decreased survival.
