Long-term administration of intravenous inotropes in advanced heart failure. Patients in heart transplantation (HTx) waiting list for advanced heart failure (HF) are susceptible to acute deterioration refractory to standard HF medical therapies. Limited data are available on long-term in-hospital continuous intravenous (IV) inotropic therapy as bridge to definite therapies. We reviewed medical records of all heart transplant recipients treated in the pre-HTx phase with in-hospital continuous IV inotropes at our institution between 2012 and 2018. We analysed data before the beginning of continuous IV therapy and at the moment of HTx. We report data of 24 patients (mean age of 43.5 ± 15.7 years) treated with IV inotropes as bridge to HTx (median follow-up of 28 months after HTx). The main length of IV inotropic therapy was 84 ± 66 days (min 22; max 264 days). At the beginning, the most frequently used inotrope was dopamine (median dosage of 3 mcg/kg/min, interquartile range 2.5-3.75), alone (n = 11, 46%) or in combination with other inotropes (n = 13, 54%). In 18 patients, the class of inotropes was changed during the hospitalization. We registered a progressive improvement of perfusion markers and neuro-hormonal activation. In-hospital continuous parenteral inotropic therapy may serve as a temporary pharmacological bridge to HTx in patients with advanced HF that are actively listed to HTx with good reply in terms of prognosis and perfusion markers.
