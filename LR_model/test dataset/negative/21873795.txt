[Effect of interleukin-17 and T helper cell 17 on acute heart allograft rejection in mice]. To investigate the role of T helper cell 17(Th17) cells and their cytokines IL-17 in heart allograft rejection in mice. The heart transplantation models were randomly divided into 2 groups: a allograft group (n=12) and an isograft group (n=12).On the post-operative day (POD) 3 and 7, serum IL-17 level was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Th17 cells in heart grafts were measured by flow cytometry. The heart grafts were harvested and saved in 10% formalin, and then embedded in paraffin. Compared with the iso-graft group, the allograft group had a higher serum level of IL-17 on POD3 and POD7 (P<0.05), and the level of IL-17 was higher on POD7 than that on POD3 (P<0.05). The allograft group had more Th17 cells infiltrating in grafts on POD3 and POD7 (P<0.05) and there were more Th17 cells infiltrating on POD7 than that on POD3 (P<0.05). Histological examination showed that the prolongation of post transplantation time resulted in more rejection pathological changes. Th17 cells may play an important role in the development of heart transplant rejection. IL-17 may serve as a predictive parameter for allograft rejection in the future.
