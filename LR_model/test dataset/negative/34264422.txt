Shared Care to Destination Therapy Left Ventricular Assist Device Site: a Novel Strategy to Start a Successful Mechanical Circulatory Support Program. Heart failure is an important healthcare issue because of its high prevalence, mortality, and morbidity. Advanced heart failure therapies have improved significantly over the years with improved outcomes. Heart transplantation remains an elusive treatment option for most patients; hence, the need for alternative therapy has given rise to the use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, initially as bridge to transplantation, but with more recent use as destination therapy. This review focuses on the intricacies of establishing a successful left ventricular assist device (LVAD) program for destination therapy in the setting of a growing anticipated need for wider availability of such treatment options. Guidelines have established the role of MCS in patients with advanced HF refractory to optimal guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and cardiac device interventions. Multiple studies have shown generational improvement in the overall safety profile of MCS devices with the use of newer devices for destination therapy showing improved outcomes. Heart failure is a growing cardiovascular problem with an anticipated growing need for advanced HF therapies including MCS devices. A model of shared care LVAD to destination therapy implanting site should be considered as a strategy to start a successful LVAD program.
