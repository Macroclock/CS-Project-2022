The natural killer cell activating receptor, NKG2D, is critical to antibody-dependent chronic rejection in heart transplantation. Chronic rejection is among the most pressing clinical challenges in solid organ transplantation. Interestingly, in a mouse model of heterotopic heart transplantation, antibody-dependent, natural killer (NK) cell-mediated chronic cardiac allograft vasculopathy occurs in some donor-recipient strain combinations, but not others. In this study, we sought to identify the mechanism underlying this unexplained phenomenon. Cardiac allografts from major histocompatibility complex (MHC) mismatched donors were transplanted into immune-deficient C57Bl/6.rag 'animal models: murine', 'basic (laboratory) research / science', 'heart (allograft) function / dysfunction', 'heart transplantation / cardiology', 'immunobiology', 'natural killer (NK) cells / NK receptors', 'rejection: antibody-mediated (ABMR)', 'rejection: chronic'
