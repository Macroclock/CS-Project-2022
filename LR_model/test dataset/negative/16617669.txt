Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) in heart recipients. In conclusion, comparative clinical studies with tacrolimus in heart recipients tend to show a similar or increased diabetogenic potential compared with cyclosporine-ME-based therapy. However, these changes are often accompanied by a reduced effect on lipid metabolism and hypertension suggesting a superior cardiovascular risk profile. The superior control of acute rejection also positions tacrolimus as an attractive alternative to cyclosporine for heart recipients.
