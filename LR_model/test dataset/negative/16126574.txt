Surgical resection for successful treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis: report of 3 cases. We present 3 patients, 2 with recent heart transplants, complicated with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), treated successfully with surgical resection. These patients demonstrate the role of surgery in management of IPA, and 2 heart transplant patients are of particular interest as surgical treatment of IPA after solid organ transplantation is seldom reported.
