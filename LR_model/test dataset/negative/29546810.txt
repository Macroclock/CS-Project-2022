Total artificial heart implantation in a young Marfan syndrome patient. Cardiovascular complications represent the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with Marfan syndrome. Here, we describe a unique case where a total artificial heart was implanted in a young Marfan syndrome woman. A 22-year-old postpartum African American female with Marfan syndrome developed multiple severe valve dysfunction and biventricular failure that was refractory to medical management. She previously had a Bentall procedure for Type A aortic dissection and repair of a Type B dissection. We implanted a total artificial heart with a good outcome. Total artificial heart is a durable option for severe biventricular failure and multiple valvular dysfunction as a bridge to transplant in a young patient with Marfan syndrome.
