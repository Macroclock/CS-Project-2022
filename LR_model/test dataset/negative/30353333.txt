Experimental Cardiomyogenesis Under Conditions of Administration of Different Doses of the Allogeneic Biomaterial. We studied the effect of different concentrations of the allogeneic biotransplant on myocardial recovery. In Wistar rats, coronary artery was ligated and intramyocardial injection of 12 or 24 mg Alloplant biomaterial suspension was performed. Histological analysis was conducted on paraffin sections stained by Mallory. The index of the scar area was measured on preparations of transverse sections of the hearts. Allogeneic biomaterial produced cardioprotective and regenerative effect in the myocardium damaged by ischemia. After administration of Alloplant in a dose of 12 mg, the index of scar area decreased by 2.74 times; after doubling the Alloplant dose (24 mg), the index of scar area decreased by 26 times.
