[A Case of General Anesthesia for a Cardiac Transplanted Patient Undergoing Inguinal Hernia Repair under Laparoscopic Surgery]. A 52-year-old man was scheduled for the repair of inguinal hernia recurrence. When he was 48 years of age, he received a heart transplantation due to severe heart failure resulting from ischemic heart disease. When he was 50 years old, he suffered from inguinal hernia, and it was repaired under spinal anesthesia. During this surgery, he experienced pain because of the inadequate effect of anesthesia, but his blood pressure and heart rate were stable. We suspected that this was because of denervation of the heart. On hernia repair for inguinal hernia recurrence, general anesthesia was chosen, induced with midazolam, rocuronium, and fentanyl and maintained with sevoflurane, rocuronium, fentanyl, and remifentanil. The blood pressure was mostly stable during anesthesia, but we noted an increase in the heart rate when the trachea was intubated and extubated and when surgical incision started. This phenomenon may indicate reinnervation of the transplanted heart. We could safely manage anesthesia without invasive monitoring because the transplanted heart functioned favorably and surgery was minimally invasive.
