Sinus tachycardia is associated with impaired exercise tolerance following heart transplantation. Sinus tachycardia often presents in heart transplantation (HTx) recipients, but data on its effect on exercise performance are limited. Based on mean heart rate (HR) value 3 months after HTx, 181 patients transplanted from 2006 to 2015 at University of Nebraska Medical Center were divided into two groups: (i) HR<95 beats/min (bpm, n=93); and (ii) HR≥95 bpm (n=88). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was performed 1 year after HTx. Mean HR at 3 months post-HTx was 94±11 bpm and did not change significantly at 1 year post-HTx (96±11 bpm, P=.13). HR≥95 bpm at 3 months was associated with younger donor age (OR 1.1; CI 1.0-1.1, P=.02), female donors (OR -2.4; CI 1.16-5.24 P=.02), and lack of donors' heavy alcohol use (OR -0.43; CI 0.17-0.61; P=.04). HR≥95 bpm at 3 months post-HTx was independently associated with decreased exercise capacity in metabolic equivalent (P=.008), reduced peak VO HR≥95 at 3 months following HTx is associated with reduced exercise tolerance in stable HTx recipients. Medical HR reduction after HTx could improve exercise performance after HTx and merits further investigation. 'complication', 'heart (allograft) function/dysfunction', 'quality of life'
