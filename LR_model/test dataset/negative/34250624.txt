Percutaneous mitral valve repair assisted by a catheter-based circulatory support device in a heart transplant patient. Systemic infections and chronic graft rejection represent common causes of mortality and morbidity in heart transplant patients. In severe cases, cardiogenic shock (CS) may occur and require hemodynamic stabilization with temporary mechanical circulatory support (tempMCS). Under these devastating circumstances, treatment of sequelae of left ventricular dysfunction, such as secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) is challenging, especially when surgical repair is deemed futile. In nontransplant patients, interventional mitral valve repair strategies such as the MitraClip system (Abbott Cardiovascular) have been used to successfully treat secondary MR and allow for weaning from tempMCS. We report about the first patient in whom profound CS after heart transplantation was stabilized with tempMCS followed by interventional elimination of secondary MR.
