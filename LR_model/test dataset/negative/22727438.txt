An elevated ratio of early to late diastolic filling velocity recovers after heart transplantation in a time-dependent manner. Several groups have reported that an elevated ratio of early (E) to late (A) diastolic filling velocities is observed in patients after heart transplantation. However, the mechanism has not been fully analyzed. Serial echocardiography and hemodynamic study were performed in 16 patients who had received heart transplantation and had no evidence of rejection during 1 month after the operation. On Day 1 after the surgery, E/A ratio was higher and peak velocity of A wave was lower than normal range among the patients after heart transplantation. E/A ratio and peak velocity of A wave gradually normalized during 1 moth after the surgery. Meanwhile, early mitral annular velocity and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure remained within normal range during the study period. Longer ischemic time during heart transplantation procedure may cause atrial stunning, but it appears to recover within 1 month. We have to be alert to misinterpretation of this "psuedo-psuedonormal" mitral inflow pattern early after transplantation.
