[Effect of T suppressor cells on the maintenance phase of tolerance to cardiac allografts in the rats]. To study the role of T suppressor cells in immune tolerance to cardiac allografts in the rats. Male DA rat hearts were transplanted to male Lewis rats using Ono's model and randomly divided into five groups: group 1: untreated, group 2: portal venous injection of 3 x 10(8) DA splenocytes to Lewis rat, group 3: intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide (80 mg/kg) to Lewis rat, group 4: portal venous injection of 3 x 10(8) DA splenocytes combined with intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide (80 mg/kg) to Lewis rat, 15 days later heart transplantation was performed. Group 5: intravenous injection 3 (108 splenocytes of group 4 to normal recipient, and then heart transplantation was performed. Mean survival time (MST), histological changes, mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) were measured after operation. The survival time of heart allografts in the group 4 [MST: (71.5 +/- 29.1) d, t = -14.063, -13.915, -13.777; P < 0.01] was significantly longer than in the groups of 1 [MST: (7.3 +/- 1.0) d], 2 [MST: (7.8 +/- 0.8) d], 3 [MST: (8.2 +/- 1.1) d ]. Only a few inflammatory cells infiltrated in cardiac allografts in the groups of 4 and 5. MLR in the groups of 4 and 5 were significantly decreased compared with those of normal control (t = 29.902, 23.047; P < 0.01). Portal venous injection of donor splenocytes combined with intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide could induce immune tolerance to cardiac allografts. The immune tolerance could be transferred through splenocytes. T suppressor cells play an important role in the immune tolerance.
