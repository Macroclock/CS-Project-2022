Use of mTOR inhibitors in chronic heart transplant recipients with renal failure: calcineurin-inhibitors conversion or minimization? In the last decade, mTOR inhibitors (mTOR-is) have become the cornerstone of the calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-reduced/free regimens aimed to the preservation of post-transplant renal function. We compared utility and safety of the total replacement of calcineurin inhibitors with a mTOR-i with a strategy based on calcineurin inhibitor minimization and concomitant use of m-TOR-i. In a retrospective multi-center cohort of 394 maintenance cardiac recipients with renal failure (GFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), we compared 235 patients in whom CNI was replaced with a mTOR-i (sirolimus or everolimus) with 159 patients in whom mTOR-is were used to minimize CNIs. A propensity score analysis was carried out to balance between group differences. Overall, after a median time of 2 years from mTOR-i initiation, between group differences for the evolution of renal function were not observed. In a multivariate adjusted model, improvement of renal function was limited to patients with mTOR-i usage within 5years after transplantation, particularly with the conversion strategy, and in those patients who could maintain mTOR-i therapy. Significant differences between strategies were not found for mortality, infection and mTOR-i withdrawal due to drug-related adverse events. However, conversion group tended to have a higher acute rejection incidence than the minimization group (p=0.07). In terms of renal benefits, our results support an earlier use of mTOR-is, irrespective of the strategy. The selection of either a conversion or a CNI minimization protocol should be based on the clinical characteristics of the patients, particularly their rejection risk.
