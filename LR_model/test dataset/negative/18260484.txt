Total hip arthroplasty in heart transplant patients. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (AVNFH) is a known complication after heart transplantation. In order to assess the efficacy and complications of cementless total hip arthroplasty (THA) in this population, the authors analysed 24 cementless THAs in 18 patients with advanced AVNFH (stage II affecting more than 15% of the articular surface, stage III and IV according to the Ficat-Arlet classification) after a heart transplant procedure. Average duration of follow-up was 35.4 months (range: 16 to 66). Pain and function scores (Harris Hip Score and WOMAC arthritis index) showed significant improvement from the preoperative levels. There was no evidence of component loosening, heart-related complications or infection following the THA. Cementless THA is a reasonable treatment option for advanced avascular necrosis of the femoral head following heart transplant procedures.
