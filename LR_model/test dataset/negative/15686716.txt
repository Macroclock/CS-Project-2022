Corticosteroid weaning in the tacrolimus and mycophenolate era in heart transplantation: clinical and neurohormonal benefits. Compared with cyclosporine, tacrolimus-based immunosuppression yields improved metabolic outcomes in heart transplantation. Whether corticosteroid freedom provides incremental metabolic benefits in tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil immunoprophylaxis remains uncertain. In a prospective trial, 41 heart transplant patients treated with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil underwent steroid weaning immediately after transplantation until weaning was complete. Weaning was interrupted only for treated rejection with or without hemodynamic compromise. Benefits of steroid weaning assessed following the first year included B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), late infections, lipids, blood pressure, hyperglycemia, and body mass index (BMI). Of this 41 patient cohort (age 53 +/- 9 years, 50% black American, 35% women) followed for a total of 47 +/- 5 months, 25 had corticosteroids discontinued (62%) by an average of 20 +/- 11 months. No differences between the two groups were noted in baseline characteristics. Significant predictors of failure to wean steroids included higher rejection, BNP, and lower dose of mycophenolate mofetil. No significant benefits of steroid weaning were noted on lipids, blood pressure, hyperglycemia, and BMI. However, late infections (after 1 year) requiring hospitalizations were more frequent in the failure to wean group (0.60.4 vs 0 infections/patient/y, P <.001). Unlike known metabolic benefits of steroid withdrawal with cyclosporine, heart transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil demonstrate no incremental metabolic benefits, but instead experience benefits of decreased serious late infections. Furthermore, failure to discontinue corticosteroids in this series is predicted by early allograft rejection, use of lower doses of mycophenolate mofetil, and higher BNP levels suggesting poor cardiac adaptation.
