Options for the failing ventricle in pediatric heart disease. The management of the pediatric patient with the failing ventricle poses its own therapeutic challenges, not least because patient size limits options available. Once medical management has hit its ceiling, attention is turned to surgical options for mechanical support. The approach to these options has to bear in mind that there may be many potential causes for pump failure, and that these occur often in the context of pulmonary hypertension and poor gas exchange. Although extracorporeal life support has been the mainstay of treatment for acute heart failure, in the last decade, attention has been focusing on longer-term options to bridge to recovery or eventual transplant. Added to this are more novel applications of ventricular assist devices, notable in the management of the failing Fontan circulation where there are no perfect solutions. There is growing interest in the use of such devices to power this delicate circulation and extend the functional capacity of patients without resorting to transplantation. In this review article, we explore the role each of these surgical modalities has to play in the management of the child with acute and chronic heart failure, and explore the recent developments in the rapidly growing field of pediatric ventricular assist.
