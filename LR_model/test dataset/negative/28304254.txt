Clinical  A cynomolgus macaque received a heterotopic cardiac allograft as part of a transplant study, with monoclonal antibodies targeted to specific immune costimulation molecules (CD154, CD28) but no traditional immunosuppressive therapy after surgery. Clinical anemia was detected on postoperative day (POD) 35 and had worsened (Hgb, 2.3 g/dL; Hct = 7.3%) by POD 47, despite type-matched whole-blood transfusions. After a total of 4 blood transfusions, hematologic parameters were improved (Hgb, 5.9 g/dL; Hct, 18.7%). On POD 50, a peripheral blood smear revealed trypomastigotes, and qualitative RT-PCR of whole blood identified the organism as Trypanosoma cruzi. Although clinically stable initially, the macaque soon developed sufficient weight loss to necessitate euthanasia on POD 64. The final diagnosis was clinical anemia due to T. cruzi infection. This study represents the first reported case of Chagas disease after heart transplant in a NHP.
