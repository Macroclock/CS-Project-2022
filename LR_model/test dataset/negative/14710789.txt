Neurodevelopmental outcome of solid organ transplantation in children. The literature regarding organ transplantation has emphasized graft survival in the arena of organ transplantation for life-threatening disease. The concept of "if you can't get it to work .... replace it" has been successful in the adult transplant population and has found its way into the pediatric population. With the improvement in patient and graft survival rates and management of complications, the questions multiply concerning quality-of-life issues. Neurodevelopmental outcome is emerging as one of the focal points for parents, physicians, and education specialists as they request information regarding early intervention and therapies for this growing population of children from the successful era of organ transplantation.
