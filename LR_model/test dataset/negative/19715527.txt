Concomitant Aspergillus and Cytomegalovirus infection in heart transplant: early diagnosis is the key to successful treatment. Concomitant infections, which are common in patients who have received an organ transplant, must be diagnosed and treated early to prevent high mortality rates. We describe a case of concomitant Cytomegalovirus infection and Aspergillus pneumonia in a heart transplant patient who received pulsed steroids as therapy for rejection, and we describe the successful treatment of that coinfection with ganciclovir and voriconazole.
