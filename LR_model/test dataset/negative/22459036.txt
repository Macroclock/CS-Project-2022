Effects of brain death on organ quality and transplant outcome. The inferiority of organs from brain dead donors is reflected by impaired graft survival and patient outcome. Brain death effects hemodynamic stability, hormonal changes, and neuroimmunologic effects and unleashes a cascade of inflammatory events. Despite considerable efforts in experimental and clinical research, most of the mechanisms linked to brain death are only appreciated on a descriptive level. This overview presents our current understanding of the pathophysiology and consequences of brain death on organ injury and summarizes available therapeutic interventions.
