Brief Overview of Lung, Heart, and Heart-Lung Transplantation. Lung transplantation, heart transplantation, and heart-lung transplantation are life-saving treatment options for patients with lung and/or cardiac failure. Evolution in these therapies over the past several decades has led to better outcomes with application to more patients. The complexity and severity of illness of patients in the pretransplant phase has steadily increased, making posttransplant intensive care unit management more difficult. Despite these factors and the pervasive complications of immunosuppressive therapy, outcomes continue to improve.
