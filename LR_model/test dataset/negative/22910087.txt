Total artificial heart. End-stage heart failure represents a highly morbid condition for the patient with limited treatment options. From a surgical perspective, the treatment options for effective long-term survival are usually limited to heart transplantation, heart-lung transplantation or implantation of a destination mechanical circulatory support device. Assuming an advanced heart-failure patient is indeed deemed a candidate for transplantation, the patient is subject to shortages in donor organ availability and thus possible further decompensation and potential death while awaiting transplantation. Various extracorporeal and implantable ventricular-assist devices (VADs) may be able to provide temporary or long-term circulatory support for many end-stage heart-failure patients but mechanical circulatory support options for patients requiring long-term biventricular support remain limited. Implantation of a total artificial heart (TAH) currently represents one, if not the best, long-term surgical treatment option for patients requiring biventricular mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to transplant. The clinical applicability of available versions of positive displacement pumps is limited by their size and complications. Application of continuous-flow technology can help in solving some of these issues and is currently being applied in the research towards a new generation of smaller and more effective TAHs. In this review, we discuss the history of the TAH, its development and clinical application, implications for anaesthetic management, published outcomes and the future outlook for TAHs.
