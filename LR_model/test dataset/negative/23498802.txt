The significance for chronic rejection of cardiac allograft of regulated upon activation normal T-cell cytokine and its CCR5 receptor. We sought to characterize the expression of regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) and its receptor CCR5, which can activate normal T cells during chronic rejection after cardiac allografting. The rat model of cervical cardiac transplantation using a cuff technique was established in Wistar donors and Sprague-Dawley (SD) recipients. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), myofibrosis as well as RANTES and CCR5 expressions were analyzed in the allografts. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated reduced expression of RANTES and CCR5 in allograft muscle and coronary arteries when the recipients were pretreated with donor splenocytes plus cyclophosphamide. CAV and myocardial fibrosis were remarkably reduced and graft survival extended compared with non-pretreated recipients (P < .05). We suggest that the expression of RANTES and CCR5 in cardiac allografts may play important roles in chronic rejection.
