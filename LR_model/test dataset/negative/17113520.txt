Successful management of recalcitrant groin lymphorrhoea with the combination of intraoperative lymphatic mapping and muscle flap. Recalcitrant groin lymphorrhoea in high-risk patients remains a problem. In this report, a cardiac transplant patient with recalcitrant groin lymphorrhoea was successfully treated with a combination of intraoperative lymphatic mapping and sartorius muscle flap. We believe that the combined use of these two treatment options offers a more effective approach for surgical treatment of recalcitrant groin lymphorrhoea and should be considered when managing this difficult clinical problem, especially in high-risk patients.
