Comparison of basiliximab vs antithymocyte globulin for induction in pediatric heart transplant recipients: An analysis of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation database. This study aims to compare 2 common induction strategies, basiliximab and ATG. Analysis of the ISHLT transplant registry was performed. The database was queried for pediatric heart transplants from January 1, 2000, to June 30, 2015, who had received induction with basiliximab or ATG. Primary end-point was graft survival. Secondary end-points included 1-year survival and 1-year conditional survival. There were 3158 heart transplants who received induction with basiliximab or ATG. The ATG cohort was younger, more likely to have congenital heart disease or be a retransplant, have a higher PRA, longer ischemic time, and been transplanted earlier in the study period (all P<.01). There was no difference in graft loss in the basiliximab cohort compared to the ATG cohort (HR 1.18 P=.06). On conditional 1-year survival analysis, basiliximab induction was associated with graft loss (HR=1.35 95% CI 1.1-1.7, P<.01), and in the propensity-matched cohort, the basiliximab cohort was more likely to experience rejection prior to discharge (P=.04). Infection prior to discharge was more common in the antithymocyte cohort. Induction with ATG is associated with improved late graft survival compared to basiliximab.
