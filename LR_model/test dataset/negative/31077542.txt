In-hospital postoperative infection after heart transplantation: Risk factors and development of a novel predictive score. Infection is one of the most significant complications following heart transplantation (HT). The aim of this study was to identify specific risk factors for early postoperative infections in HT recipients, and to develop a multivariable predictive model to identify HT recipients at high risk. A single-center, observational, and retrospective study was conducted. The dependent variable was in-hospital postoperative infection. We examined demographic and epidemiological data from donors and recipients, surgical features, and adverse postoperative events as independent variables. Backwards, stepwise multivariable logistic regression with a P-value < 0.05 was used to identify clinical factors independently associated with the risk of in-hospital postoperative infections following HT. Six hundred seventy-seven patients were included in this study. During the in-hospital postoperative period, 348 episodes of infection were diagnosed in 239 (35.9%) patients. Seven variables were identified as independent clinical predictors of early postoperative infection after HT: history of diabetes mellitus, previous sternotomy, preoperative mechanical ventilation, primary graft failure, major surgical bleeding, use of mycophenolate mofetil, and use of itraconazole. Based on the results of multivariable models, we constructed a 7-variable (8-point) score to predict the risk of in-hospital postoperative infection in HT recipients, which showed a reasonable ability to predict the risk of in-hospital postoperative infection in this population. Prospective external validation of this new score is warranted to confirm its clinical applicability. In-hospital postoperative infection is a common complication after HT, affecting 35% of patients who underwent this procedure at our institution. Diabetes mellitus, previous sternotomy, preoperative mechanical ventilation, primary graft failure, major surgical bleeding, use of mycophenolate mofetil, and itraconazole were all independent clinical predictors of early postoperative infection after HT.
