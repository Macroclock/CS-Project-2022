Pediatric heart transplant candidates with failed donor heart allocation after Eurotransplant urgency listing profit from pretransplant mechanical circulatory support bridging. Due to the Eurotransplant organ allocation policy, urgency listing for heart transplantation (HTx) remains in force until ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation in Germany. We studied the prognosis of HTx candidates after failed donor heart allocation in urgent status. We studied all adult and pediatric (<18 years) HTx candidates who underwent primary HTx after Eurotransplant urgency listing between January 2001 and December 2006 (Group A-uHTx [A-"u"rgent status "HTx"], n = 99; Group P-uHTx [P-"u"rgent status "HTx"], n = 24) and those to whom donor heart was not urgently allocated before VAD implantation or death in the same period (Group A-fHA [A-"f"ailed "H"eart "A"llocation], n = 21, Group P-fHA [P-"f"ailed "H"eart "A"llocation], n = 10). Mortality rate after urgency listing or primary VAD implantation was studied in each group. In adult patients, 1-year mortality rate after urgency listing in Group A-fHA was 56.8% and significantly higher than in Group A-uHTx (30.6%, P < 0.001, log-rank test). After failed urgent heart allocation, 15 out of 21 patients in Group A-fHA had VAD implantation and two patients (9.5%) underwent HTx after VAD implantation. In pediatric patients, 1-year mortality rate in Group P-fHA was 40.0% and significantly higher than in Group P-uHTx (8.5%, P < 0.05). In Group P-fHA, all 10 patients underwent VAD implantation after failed urgent heart allocation and six patients (60.0%, P < 0.01 vs. Group A-fHA, Fisher's exact test) underwent HTx after VAD implantation. After failed urgent donor heart allocation, pediatric HTx candidates seem to profit more from mechanical circulatory support than adults.
