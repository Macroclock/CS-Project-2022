[Autotransplantation of the heart as the method of treatment of congestive heart failure]. Congestive heart failure with preserved or moderately lowered left ventricular pump function in some patients is caused by mitral regurgitation. Its consequences are left atrial dilation, pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid regurgitation, thromboembolic complications, disturbances of rhythm with elevated risk of sudden death. As efficacy of drug treatment and electroimpulse therapy is small surgery is the method of choice and one of alternatives - autotransplantation of the heart. Here we present a successful experience of application of this technique in a patient with moderately lowered left ventricular function, extreme degree of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, atriomegaly, atrial fibrillation, and pronounced manifestations of congestive heart failure.
