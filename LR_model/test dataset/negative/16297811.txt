Recurrence of cardiac sarcoidosis in a heart transplant recipient. We present the case of a young man who received a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as a bridge to transplantation for end-stage heart failure, in whom the diagnosis of sarcoid cardiomyopathy was made at the time of LVAD implantation. He subsequently underwent uncomplicated heart transplantation. Nineteen months later, a routine surveillance endomyocardial biopsy specimen demonstrated recurrence of sarcoidosis in the transplanted heart.
