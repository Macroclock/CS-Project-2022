Sequential big endothelin plasma levels in heart transplant recipients during bridging therapy and after successful heart transplantation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of successful heart transplantation in patients with refractory heart failure receiving bridging therapy on sequential plasma levels of big endothelin, norepinephrine, atrial natriuretic peptide and aldosterone. Fourteen patients (2 women, 12 men) accepted for heart transplantation were studied. All had severe chronic heart failure refractory to optimized oral therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and furosemide, were in New York Heart Association functional Class IV, and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of <15%, Right heart catheterization was performed in all patients (cardiac index 1.9 +/- 0.1 liters/min. m(2), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 30 +/- 2 mmHg, systemic vascular resistance index 2,827 +/- 253 dyn. s/cm(5). m(2)). As bridging therapy, patients received either prostaglandin E(1), prostaglandin E(1) and dobutamine or dobutamine alone as a continuous infusion. Neurohumoral variables were measured prior to bridging therapy and 3.5 months before and 7 and 10 months after successful heart transplantation. Big endothelin, norepinephrine and atrial natriuretic peptide plasma levels decreased from 7.4 +/- 2.9 fmol/ml, 1112 +/- 686 pg/ml and 366 +/- 312 pg/ml to 6.0 +/- 4.5 fmol/ml, 720 +/- 503 pg/ml and 198 +/- 160 pg/ml, respectively, after bridging therapy, and further to 2.1 +/- 0.9 fmol/ml (p < 0.00001 vs baseline), 527 +/- 31 pg/ml (p < 0.02 vs baseline) and 115 +/- 70 pg/ml (p < 0.03 vs baseline), respectively, after cardiac transplantation. Aldosterone plasma levels decreased from 242 +/- 220 pg/ml to 183 +/- 142 pg/ml during bridging therapy and increased after heart transplantation to 252 +/- 189 pg/ml. Plasma creatinine levels increased from 1.2 +/- 0.4 mg/dl at baseline to 1.4 +/- 0.2 mg/dl after transplantation (NS). The study suggests that excessive overproduction of big endothelin, atrial natriuretic peptide and norepinephrine is predominantly related to pump failure and, after cardiac transplantation, a moderate spillover of big endothelin persists. Its specific origin, however, remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, our data suggest a protective effect of prostaglandin E(1) on kidney function after heart transplantation.
