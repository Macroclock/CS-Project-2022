Peritransplant VLA-4 blockade inhibits endogenous memory CD8 T cell infiltration into high-risk cardiac allografts and CTLA-4Ig resistant rejection. Recipient endogenous memory CD8 T cells expressing reactivity to donor class I MHC infiltrate MHC-mismatched cardiac allografts within 24Â hours after reperfusion and express effector functions mediating graft injury. The current study tested the efficacy of Very Late Antigen-4 (VLA-4) blockade to inhibit endogenous memory CD8 T cell infiltration into cardiac allografts and attenuate early posttransplant inflammation.
