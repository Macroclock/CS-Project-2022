Growth hormone resistance in severe heart failure resolves after cardiac transplantation. Severe heart failure (HF) is associated with cachexia; this is often reversed post cardiac transplantation (HTx) with frequent development of obesity. Growth hormone (GH) resistance is common in HF and may contribute to cachexia. Whether GH resistance resolves post HTx is unknown. We aimed to confirm that HF is associated with GH resistance and to test the hypothesis that GH resistance resolves post HTx. We measured GH, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and body composition in 10 HF patients awaiting HTx, in 18 patients 11 +/- 8 months post HTx, and seven controls. Body mass index was 23.5 +/- 3.2 in HF patients and 29.3 +/- 5.7 post HTx. HTx patients had gained 14 +/- 8 kg since HTx. GH was elevated in HF (control: 0.21 +/- 0.25; HF: 1.13 +/- 1.19; HTx: 0.11 +/- 0.13 ng/mL; P < 0.007), while IGF-1 was higher in HTx (control: 114 +/- 57; HF: 94 +/- 52; HTx: 190 +/- 106 ng/mL; P < 0.02). HTx had higher total body and abdominal fat %. GH resistance is present in severe HF and resolves post HTx. These findings should be confirmed through larger trials.
