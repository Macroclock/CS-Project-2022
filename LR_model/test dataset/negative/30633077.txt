Mechanical circulatory support in the heart failure population. Use of durable left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) has increased considerably in recent years because of the insufficient supply of donor hearts for cardiac transplantation and improvement in outcomes from refinements in technology. This review examines clinical utility of these devices and summarizes the most recent evidence supporting the use of LVAD therapy. There continues to be significant advancements made in LVAD technology, which has resulted in improvements in the rates of adverse events and overall patient quality of life. Specifically, less invasive and improved surgical techniques have resulted in fewer incidence of pump thrombosis and stringent blood pressure management have been shown to significantly decrease stroke rates. The continued advances in LVAD therapy have resulted in significant improvement in overall survival; however, complication rates remain relatively high. Future work will focus on improvements in adverse outcomes and ultimately the possibility that LVADs will be a viable alternative to transplantation in patients with end-stage heart failure.
