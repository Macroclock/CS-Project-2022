Ventricular-assist devices for the treatment of chronic heart failure. The role of ventricular-assist devices in the management of end-stage heart failure is growing. Initially developed as a 'bridge to transplantation', they are now implanted permanently in patients who need cardiac replacement but are not candidates for cardiac transplantation ('destination therapy'). Furthermore, observations from expert centers indicate that a significant proportion of patients under long-term mechanical assistance can be weaned from mechanical circulatory support after significant functional recovery of their native heart ('bridge to recovery'). This review discusses the emerging roles of mechanical circulatory support and their direct implications in clinical practice. Evolution of devices, important aspects of candidate selection, challenging issues in the management of ventricular-assist device patients (infection, device malfunction, anticoagulation-thromboembolic complications, psychosocial issues and cost) and ongoing research targeting sustained myocardial recovery are discussed.
