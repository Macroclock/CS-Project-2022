High intensity exercise training programme following cardiac transplant. A 26-year-old male patient who presented with symptoms of end stage cardiac failure as a result of dilated cardiomyopathy, had an orthotopic cardiac transplantation. A comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation programme was provided to him and he was introduced to a sport (tennis). The exercise training programme progressed from low intensity training to high intensity programme over a period of 15 months. A cardio-pulmonary exercise test done 22 months after surgery suggested that he was able to achieve the aerobic capacity comparable to that of a normal South Indian subject. He participated successfully in the World Transplant Games in Sydney and returned safely. This suggests that after a proper cardiac rehabilitation programme, patients undergoing heart transplantation can achieve normal physiological responses to lead a normal active life.
