The adapted Heart Donor Score. The Heart Donor Score (HDS) predicts donor organ discard for medical reasons and survival after heart transplantation (HTX) in the Eurotransplant allocation system. Our aim was to adapt the HDS for application in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry. To adjust for differences between the Eurotransplant and UNOS registries, the "adapted HDS" was created (aHDS) by exclusion of the covariates "valve function," "left-ventricular hypertrophy," and exclusion of "drug abuse" from the variable "compromised history." Two datasets were analyzed to evaluate associations of the aHDS with donor organ discard (n = 70 948) and survival (n = 19 279). The aHDS was significantly associated with donor organ discard [odds ratio 2.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.68-2.76, P < 0.001; c-statistic: 0.937). The score performed comparably in donors <60 and ≥60 years of age. The aHDS was a significant predictor of survival as evaluated by univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07, P = 0.023), although the association lost significance in a multivariable model. The aHDS predicts donor organ discard. Negative effects of most aHDS components on survival are likely eliminated by highly accurate donor selection processes.
