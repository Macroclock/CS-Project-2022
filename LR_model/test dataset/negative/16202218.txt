Early induction of matrix metalloproteinase-9 transduces signaling in human heart end stage failure. Extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover is regulated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and plays an important role in cardiac remodeling. Previous studies from our lab demonstrated an increase in gelatinolytic-MMP-2 and -9 activities in endocardial tissue from ischemic cardiomyopathic (ICM) and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathic (DCM) hearts. The signaling mechanism responsible for the left ventricular (LV) remodeling, however, is unclear. Administration of cardiac specific inhibitor of metalloproteinase (CIMP) prevented the activation of MMP-2 and -9 in ailing to failing myocardium. Activation of MMP-2 and -9 leads to induction of proteinase activated receptor-1 (PAR-1). We hypothesize that the early induction of MMP-9 is a key regulator for modulating intracellular signaling through activation of PAR and various downstream events which are implicated in development of cardiac fibrosis in an extracellular receptor mediated kinase-1 (ERK-1) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) dependent manner. To test this hypothesis, explanted human heart tissues from ICM and DCM patients were obtained at the time of orthotopic cardiac transplants. Quantitative analysis of MMP-2 and -9 gelatinolytic activities was made by real-time quantitative zymography. Gel phosphorylation staining for PAR-1 showed a significant increase in ICM hearts. Western blot and RT-PCR analysis and in-situ labeling, showed significant increased expression of PAR-1, ERK-1and FAK in ICM and DCM. These observations suggest that the enhanced expression and potentially increased activity of LV myocardial MMP-9 triggers the signal cascade instigating cardiac remodeling. This early mechanism for the initiation of LV remodeling appears to have a role in end-stage human heart failure.
