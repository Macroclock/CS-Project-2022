Recipient atrial flutter masquerading as donor flutter in a heart transplant recipient. Atrial flutter is common after orthotopic heart transplantation. We present the case of a patient who presented with atrial flutter on 12-lead electrocardiogram. On invasive electrophysiologic study, the donor heart was found to be in sinus rhythm and the recipient atrium was in flutter, which was dissociated from the donor.
