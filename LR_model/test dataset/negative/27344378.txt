Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in end-stage heart failure patients listed for heart transplantation: Results from a large retrospective registry. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are recommended in patients with low ejection fraction. However, the survival benefit of ICDs in patients with end-stage heart failure listed for heart transplantation is unclear. To evaluate the ICD benefit on mortality in this population. Three hundred and eighty consecutive patients listed for heart transplantation between 2005 and 2009 in one tertiary heart transplant centre were enrolled in a retrospective registry; 122 patients received an ICD before or within 3 months after being listed for heart transplantation (ICD group). Predictors of death on the waiting list were assessed by Cox regression. Overall, 15.6% of patients died while awaiting heart transplantation. Non-ICD patients presented more often haemodynamic compromise requiring mechanical circulatory support (29.1% vs. 9.8%; P<0.001), and were more likely to die while on the waiting list (19.0% vs. 8.3%; log-rank P=0.001). However, in the multivariable model, ICD did not remain an independent predictor of death. Need for mechanical circulatory support (P<0.001), low ejection fraction (P=0.001) and registration on the regular list (P=0.008) were the only independent predictors of death. Death was mainly caused by haemodynamic compromise (76.3% of deaths), which occurred more frequently in the non-ICD group (14.7% vs. 5.8%; log-rank P=0.002). Unknown/arrhythmic deaths did not differ significantly between the two groups (3.9% vs. 1.7%; log-rank P=0.21). ICD-related complications occurred in 21.4% of patients, mainly as a result of postoperative worsening of heart failure (11.9%). Haemodynamic failure appears as the main determinant of mortality in patients with end-stage heart failure awaiting heart transplantation. ICD seems to have little benefit on survival in this population.
