Mortality from renal dysfunction in heart transplant patients: creatinine versus glomerular filtration rate. One of the most common, significant problems after heart transplantation (HT) is the development of renal dysfunction. In recent years, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has replaced the serum creatinine as the standard parameter for its determination. Our objective was to analyze which renal function parameter (creatinine or GFR) at 1 year after HT better classified patients who will die during follow-up. The study included 316 consecutive HT patients surviving at least 1 year after transplantation. Creatinine and GFR were determined by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD4) equation. Mortality during the follow-up was analyzed to compare both parameters using receiver operating characteristic curves. Over a mean follow-up of 6±3 years, 97 patients died (30.7%). At 1 year after HT, the patients who succumbed displayed a significantly higher mean creatinine value (1.63±0.65 vs 1.41±0.64 mg/dL; P=.004) and a more decreased GFR (53.8 vs 60.8 mL/min/1.73 m2; P=.006). Both groups had the same area under the curve, 0.61 (95% confidence interval: 0.54-0.68; P=.002). Among our population, GFR calculated by the abbreviated MDRD4 equation did not provide any additional prognostic value to serum creatinine at 1 year after HT to predict long-term mortality.
