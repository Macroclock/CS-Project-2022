Post-operative Outcomes in Children Undergoing Fontan Palliation in a Regionalized Surgical System. Evidence suggests that outcomes in pediatric cardiac surgery are improved by consolidating care into centers of excellence. Our objective was to determine if outcomes are equivalent in patients across a large regional referral base, or if patients from centers without on-site surgery are at a disadvantage. Since 1996, all pediatric cardiac surgery has been offered at one of two centers within the region assessed, with the majority being performed at Stollery Children's Hospital. All patients who underwent a Fontan between 1996 and 2016 were included. Follow-up data including length of stay (LOS), repeat surgical interventions, and transplant-free survival were acquired for each patient. The association between post-operative outcomes and home center was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional Hazards models. 320 children (median age 3.3 years, IQR 2.8-4.0) were included; 120 (37.5%) had the surgical center as their home center. Cardiac anatomy was hypoplastic left heart syndrome in 107 (33.4%) subjects. Median LOS was 11 days (IQR, 8-17), and there were 8 in-hospital deaths. There were 17 deaths and 11 transplants over the course of follow-up. Five-year transplant-free survival was 92.5%. There was no difference in hospital re-intervention, late re-intervention, or survival by referral center (all p > 0.05). In multivariable analysis, home center was not predictive of either LOS (R  'Access to care', 'Congenital heart disease', 'Fontan', 'Outcomes'
