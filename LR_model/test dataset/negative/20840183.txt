The effect and safety after extended use of continuous negative pressure of 75 mmHg over mesh and allodermis graft on open sternal wound from oversized heart transplant in a 3-month-old infant. Negative pressure therapy (NPT) has been reported to be effective in treating infants with open chest wounds. This report further supports its effectiveness by treating a 3-month-old infant with a 12 Ã— 7 cm sized opening in its chest after an oversized heart transplantation. After applying a mesh and allodermis over the defect, 75-mmHg continuous negative pressure was set and used for an extended period of 104 days. The haemodynamic status was evaluated during this period. The wound was closed with secondary intention and it healed well after NPT. There was no haemodynamic instability during the treatment course. The extended use of a continuous negative pressure of 75 mmHg over the mesh and alloderm graft was a reliable and safe option to close the massive defect in the chest of a 3-month-old infant.
