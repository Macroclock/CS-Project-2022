Intermittent antibody-based combination therapy removes alloantibodies and achieves indefinite heart transplant survival in presensitized recipients. It is well established that primed/memory T cells play a critical role in heart transplant rejection. This contributes to the challenges faced in the transplant clinic because current treatments that are efficient in controlling na√Øve T cell alloresponses have limited efficacy on primed T cell responders. Fully MHC-mismatched heart transplantation was performed from BALB/c to C57BL/6 mice presensitized with BALB/c splenocytes 14 days pretransplantation. A combination therapy comprising CD70-, CD154-, and CD8-specific antibodies (Abs) was administered at day 0 and 4 posttransplantation with rapamycin on days 0 to 4. The Ab combination therapy extended heart transplant survival in presensitized recipients from median survival time 8 days (MST) to MST 78 days. A decrease in the number of splenic interferon-gamma-secreting cells measured by ELISpot assay was seen in the treated group compared with the untreated controls. However, graft-infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells persisted despite treatment and the number of intragraft CD4+ T cells increased at day 30 posttransplantation. When an additional "rescue therapy" comprising the same Abs was readministered at days 30, 60, and 90 posttransplantation, T cell infiltration was reduced and indefinite graft survival was observed. Furthermore, rescue therapy resulted in gradual decrease in titer and, by day 90 posttransplantation, the complete loss of the preexisting, donor-specific Abs. We conclude that our Ab combination therapy extends allograft survival in presensitized recipients. When combined with intermittent Ab-mediated rescue therapy, this results in indefinite allograft survival and a loss of the preexisting, donor-specific Abs from the circulation.
