Hypertension after heart and heart/lung transplantation in childhood--study on the evolution of short-term blood pressure regulation. Arterial hypertension complicates the follow-up of heart- and heart/lung-transplanted children. We investigated the evolution of BRS as short-time BP regulation mechanism and BP after heart and heart/lung transplantation. Twenty patients (15 males; mean age 15.1 ± 4.3 yr) were studied twice at intervals of 2.96 ± 0.87 yr. BRS was calculated using non-invasive beat-to-beat BP measurement system. HRV was calculated (LF, sympathetic influence; HF, parasympathetic influence). BRS increased in 10 patients (3.67 ± 1.43 ms/mmHg vs. 7.59 ± 3.40 mmHg, p = 0.005) (group 1). Six of 10 patients received antihypertensive medication. BRS decreased or remained unchanged in 10 patients (8.93 ± 7.9 ms/mmHg vs. 5.32 ± 6.6 ms/mmHg, p = 0.008) (group 2) with 9/10 patients necessitating antihypertensive medication. Group 1 showed LF/HF increase (LF/HF 1.03 ± 0.9 vs. 4.36 ± 2.32, p = 0.03); group 2 showed LF/HF decrease (LF/HF 3.7 ± 2.1 vs. 1.84 ± 1.1, p = 0.023). Evolution of BRS after heart and heart/lung transplantation in childhood seems to influence the necessity of antihypertensive medication. With time, increasing short-time BP regulation involving sympathetic reinnervation may improve BP.
