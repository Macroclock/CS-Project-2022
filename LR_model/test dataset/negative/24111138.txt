Complexity of the heart rhythm after heart transplantation by entropy of transition network for RR-increments of RR time intervals between heartbeats. Network models have been used to capture, represent and analyse characteristics of living organisms and general properties of complex systems. The use of network representations in the characterization of time series complexity is a relatively new but quickly developing branch of time series analysis. In particular, beat-to-beat heart rate variability can be mapped out in a network of RR-increments, which is a directed and weighted graph with vertices representing RR-increments and the edges of which correspond to subsequent increments. We evaluate entropy measures selected from these network representations in records of healthy subjects and heart transplant patients, and provide an interpretation of the results.
