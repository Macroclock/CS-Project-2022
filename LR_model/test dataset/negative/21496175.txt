Myocardial scar in sarcoidosis by 12-lead ECG and pathology. This case demonstrates the use of QRS scoring to quantify myocardial scar in a patient with cardiac sarcoidosis and left bundle branch block who progressively received an implantable defibrillator, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), left ventricular assist device and cardiac transplantation. QRS scoring has been shown to correlate with magnetic resonance imaging measurements of scar, identify arrhythmogenic substrate and predict response to CRT, but had not previously been compared to pathology-documented scar in nonischemic cardiomyopathies. Further study is warranted to assess the ability of QRS scoring to guide therapy for individual patients.
