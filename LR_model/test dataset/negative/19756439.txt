[60-year old woman with round lesion of the right upper lobe of the lung after heart transplantation]. We report on a woman presenting with fever and novel round lesion in the lung four months after heart transplantation. Microbiologic assessment of bronchial lavage and operative specimen revealed pulmonary nocardiosis. Furthermore, cerebral involvement has been observed. Antibiotic treatment according to the microbiological sensitivity test for eleven months resulted in complete remission of pulmonary and cerebral nocardiosis. Immunosuppressive treatment increases the risk for opportunistic infections early after transplantation as well as malignancies during the late course.
