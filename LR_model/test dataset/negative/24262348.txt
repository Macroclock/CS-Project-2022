A history of devices as an alternative to heart transplantation. The rapid evolution of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has extended survival and improved quality of life for patients suffering from the most advanced heart failure (HF). Survival at one year after placement of a left ventricular assist device exceeds 80%. MCS and transplant have developed in counterpoint to each other. Patients with HF now have a meaningful option for lifelong support even if they are not candidates for heart transplant. As the profiles of MCS recipients change and the next generation of devices emerges, new challenges and opportunities await physicians caring for patients with cardiac failure.
