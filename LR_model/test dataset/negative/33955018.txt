Deactivation of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) after recovery of cardiac function: A case report. Recovery of heart function during support with a durable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is uncommon. There are few reports of cases that address eliminating the LVAD without the need for a heart transplant. Radical surgical removal of the LVAD may distort the left ventricular cavity and thus affect its function, in addition to the associated risks of the operation. Innovative ways to deactivate the LVAD, relying mainly on vascular plugs implanting in the outflow graft, have been used. Few reports have shown the success of this method. In this case report, we review the story of a young patient with advanced heart failure who underwent LVAD implantation. After six months, there was a dramatic improvement of heart function that enabled successful deactivation of the device. 'deactivation', 'heart failure', 'left ventricular assist device'
