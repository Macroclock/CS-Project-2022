Long-term pulmonary vascular reactivity after orthotopic heart transplantation by the biatrial versus the bicaval technique. Advantages of the bicaval versus the biatrial technique have been reported, emphasizing atrial electrical stability and less tricuspid regurgitation. To analyze the impact of the surgical technique on long-term pulmonary pressures, contractility, and graft valvular behavior after heart transplantation. Among 400 orthotopic heart transplantation recipients from 1985 to 2010, we selected 30 consecutive patients who had survived beyond 3 years. The biatrial versus bicaval surgical technique groups included 15 patients each. Their preoperative clinical characteristics were similar. None of the patients displayed a pulmonary vascular resistance or pulmonary artery pressure over 6U Wood or 60 mm Hg, respectively. We evaluated invasive hemodynamic parameters during routine endomyocardial biopsies. Two-dimensional echocardiographic parameters were obtained from routine examinations. There were no significant differences regarding right atrial pressure, systolic pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, cardiac index, systolic blood pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction, and mitral regurgitation (P > .05). Tricuspid regurgitation increased significantly over the 3 years of observation only among the biatrial group (P = .0212). In both groups, the right atrial pressure, pulmonary wedge capillary pressure, transpulmonary gradient, and pulmonary vascular resistance decreased significantly (P < .05) from the pre- to the postoperative examination. In both groups cardiac index and systemic blood pressure increased significantly after transplantation (P < .05). Comparative analysis of the groups only showed significant differences regarding right atrial pressure and degree of tricuspid regurgitation; the bicaval group showing the best performance. Both surgical techniques ensure adequate left ventricular function in the long term; however, the bicaval technique provided better trends in hemodynamic performance, as well as a lower incidence and severity of tricuspid valve dysfunction.
