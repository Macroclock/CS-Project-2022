Stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase improves donor organ function in rat heart transplantation. Heart transplantation remains the definitive therapy of end-stage heart failure. Ischemia-reperfusion injury occurring during transplantation is a primary determinant of long-term outcome of heart transplantation and primary graft insufficiency. Modification of the nitric oxide/soluble guanylate cyclase/cyclic guanosine monophosphate signaling pathway appears to be one of the most promising among the pharmacological interventional options. We aimed at characterizing the cardio-protective effects of the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat in a rat model of heterotopic heart transplantation. Donor Lewis rats were treated orally with either riociguat or placebo for two days (n = 9) in each transplanted group and (n = 7) in donor groups. Following explantation, hearts were heterotopically transplanted. After one hour reperfusion, left ventricular pressure-volume relations and coronary blood flow were recorded. Molecular biological measurements and histological examination were also completed. Left ventricular contractility (systolic pressure: 117 ± 13 vs. 48 ± 5 mmHg, p < 0.001; dP/dt
