Post-transplant diabetes mellitus associated with heart and lung transplant. The incidence of post-transplant diabetes (PTDM) is variable primarily due to a lack of standardised diagnostic criteria. This study aimed to assess the incidence of PTDM in heart and lung transplant (HLT) patients and to review if the management of these patients is in accordance with the 2014 American Society of Transplantation guidelines. This was a retrospective study in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Data was collected from the patients who had undergone HLT. All patients who had a heart and/or lung transplant between 2005 and 2017 were identified. The majority of our patients had lung 111 (53.9%), heart 94 (45.6%) and combined heart/lung 1(0.5%) transplants. A total of 174 (84.5%) patients were screened for diabetes pre-transplantation. Two hundred five (99.9%) patients were screened for PTDM post-surgery. The cumulative incidence for PTDM was 19.4% (40/206). All patients with PTDM were on prednisolone, 32 (80%) on tacrolimus and 4 (10%) on cyclosporine. The cumulative incidence of post-transplant diabetes in our cohort was 19.4%. The majority of the patients were screened before and after transplant for glucose abnormality. The authors recommend that all patients should be managed in a multidisciplinary setting including transplant physicians, endocrinlogist, diabetes nurse specialists, transplant nurses and dietitians.
