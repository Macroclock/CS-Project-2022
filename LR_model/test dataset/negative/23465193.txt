ISHLT International Registry for Heart and Lung Transplantation - three decades of scientific contributions. The International Registry for Heart and Lung Transplantation (Registry) was established by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplant (ISHLT) in 1983. It has since become the largest repository of heart and lung transplant data in the world. The continued relevance of the Registry and its high impact scientific contributions have been possible through accountability and responsible governance. This manuscript describes the logistics of the Registry's operations, its goals and future directions.
