Percutaneous blade and balloon atrioseptostomy as a supplement to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a bridge to heart transplantation. In patients with severe ventricular dysfunction, the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) could be insufficient to discharge the left ventricle. The percutaneous blade and balloon atrioseptostomy that requires transeptal catheter-based experience could be an advisable technique to supplement assistance as a bridge to partial recovery or to heart transplantation. We present a case of a young male who presented for cardiogenic shock with a huge thrombus in the left main coronary artery in whom blade and balloon atrioseptostomy in addition to the ECMO was helpful to bail out and to perform heart transplantation.
