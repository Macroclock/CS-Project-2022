Heart transplantation in pediatric age. Heart transplantation, formerly the final option for terminally ill children, has now become the treatment of choice for a number of serious acquired or congenital cardiac conditions, which cannot be treated conservatively. Nevertheless, several problems remain unsolved. First of all the shortage of donors, mainly in the first months and years of life, which has become more and more significant with time, regardless of the country, religious belief or culture of the people. Secondly, the long-term impact of immunosuppression in a developing organism, and its possible inter-relation with the primary disorder, which leads to intractable heart failure. Whether a heart transplant is a cure or an ongoing disease for both the child and the family is another matter of concern. These and other topics are covered in this article.
