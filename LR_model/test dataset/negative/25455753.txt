5-Aminolevulinic acid with ferrous iron induces permanent cardiac allograft acceptance in mice via induction of regulatory cells. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), a precursor of heme biosynthesis, plays a fundamentally important role in aerobic energy metabolism. Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 cleaves heme to form biliverdin, carbon monoxide (CO) and iron (Fe(2+)). The anti-inflammatory properties of biliverdin and CO help to alleviate ischemia/reperfusion injury as well as acute and/or chronic allograft rejection. We investigated whether 5-ALA and Fe(2+) exerts salutary effects in the setting of organ transplantation. An in vitro mixed-lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay and cardiac allotransplantation model (CBA to C57BL/10) were used to evaluate the effects of 5-ALA and Fe(2+) on transplantation tolerance. Treatment with 5-ALA and sodium ferrous citrate (SFC) resulted in permanent acceptance in the murine cardiac allografts in a dose-, SFC- and HO-1-dependent manner. The number of graft-infiltrating CD8 T cells was lower and the survival response of recipient spleen T cells to donor-type alloantigens was less compared with control recipients; however, numbers of both regulatory T cells and dendritic cells were significantly increased in 5-ALA/SFC-treated recipients. Our findings show that 5-ALA/SFC inhibits T-cell proliferation in response to alloantigens and an increased number of regulatory cells, resulting in permanent cardiac allograft acceptance in mice. These findings highlight the major roles of CO and/or HO-1 in inducing tolerance and suggest that 5-ALA/SFC may be a clinically effective treatment for allograft rejection.
