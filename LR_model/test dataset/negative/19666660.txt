Transfer from ciclosporin to mycophenolate-sirolimus immunosuppression for chronic renal disease after heart transplantation: safety and efficacy of two regimens. Chronic kidney disease is common after heart transplantation, and is related to ciclosporin (CsA) therapy. We compared the safety and efficacy of two ciclosporin withdrawal regimens. CsA was stopped and sirolimus (SRL) commenced immediately and the transfer was covered with prednisolone. Those on azathioprine (AZA) were transferred to MMF. In protocol A, the SRL target concentration was 16 (12-20) ng/ml; in protocol B, the target concentration was 7(5-10) ng/ml, but mycophenolate (MMF) and steroids were commenced prior to the transfer. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups except that group B were switched later after transplantation. Renal function improved significantly in both groups; this was maintained up to 1 year. Two patients in group A experienced acute rejection (ISHLT grade 3A or 2R); none was seen in group B. Six patients (46%) remained on protocol A and 22 (85%) remained on protocol B at 1 year. MMF-SRL substitution resulted in a rapid but partial improvement in renal function; the lower dose SRL regimen was better tolerated.
