[Left ventricular assist devices in the catheterisation laboratory]. Mechanical cardiac support represents a large spectrum of devices. The duration of assistance may vary from a few hours in the cath lab to several weeks. The goals for a temporary support by percutaneus assistance are: improve end-organ perfusion; decrease pulmonary capillary wedge pressure; decrease myocardial oxygen consumption. The potential indications are: acute left ventricular dysfunction; "bridge to recovery": acute myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, valve disease bridge to surgery; "bridge to implantable LVAD"; "bridge to transplant"; high risk PCI and surgery.
