Administration of Interleukin-35-Conditioned Autologous Tolerogenic Dendritic Cells Prolong Allograft Survival After Heart Transplantation. IL-35, a powerful suppressor of inflammation and autoimmunity, is primarily secreted by regulatory T cells (Tregs) and can, in turn, promote Treg differentiation. However, the precise effect of IL-35 on dendritic cells (DCs) remains to be clarified. In this study, we investigated the expression of IL-35 in DCs after stimulation with LPS utilizing enzyme linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA), quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting, and the influence of IL-35 on the maturation and function of DCs by mixed lymphocyte reaction assay and flow cytometry. We further examined the regulation of IL-35 in DCs by the microRNA let-7i (let-7i) via transfected with let-7i mimic, inhibitor or suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1) siRNA. IL-35-overexpressing DCs were transfused into BALB/c recipients with C57BL/6 heart transplantations to verify the role of immune tolerance in transplantation. The results showed that IL-35 expression was significantly up-regulated following lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced DC maturation. Overexpression of IL-35 suppressed DC maturation, promoted the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and subsequently affected the balance between Treg and Th17 cells. IL-35 expression in DCs was regulated by let-7i, which targets SOCS1. The transfusion of IL-35-transfected DCs induced Treg generation in mice and prolonged cardiac allograft survival. Our data demonstrated that IL-35 induces tolerogenic DCs which are capable of alleviating allograft rejection. Clinical application of IL-35-treated DCs might be a promising approach for eliciting cardiac allograft immune tolerance.
