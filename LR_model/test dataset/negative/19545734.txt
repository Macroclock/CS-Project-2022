Panel-reactive screening and treatment practices following bridge to transplantation ventricular assist device placement. The use of left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) as a bridge to transplantation is associated with the development of circulating antibodies. We conducted a survey of all adult cardiac transplantation programs in the United States in an attempt to define current practices with regard to LVAD implantation, monitoring panel-reactive antibody (PRA) levels, treatment options, and peritransplantation management. Pretransplantation sensitization with the use of LVAD is a concern to the majority of transplantation professionals and there is no consensus on the need or mode of treatment.
