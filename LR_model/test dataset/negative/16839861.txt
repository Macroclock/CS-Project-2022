Hepatocyte growth factor: Effects on immune-mediated heart diseases. There is growing evidence of the potential role of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in various cardiovascular diseases. In addition to the beneficial effects of HGF in myocardial infarction, heart failure, and occlusive peripheral arterial disease, administration of HGF effectively suppresses acute and chronic cardiac allograft rejection and autoimmune myocarditis. The present review summarizes recent advances in the utility of HGF for heart diseases, especially immune-mediated heart diseases. Possible mechanisms of action in the suppression of T-cell-mediated immunity are also discussed.
