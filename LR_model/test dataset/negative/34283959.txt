Heart transplantation complicated by COVID-19 infection. The influence of COVID-19 on heart transplantation is considerable. Reports of COVID-19 infection in recently transplanted patients are scarce. We present a 60-year-old patient with COVID-19 infection, diagnosed six days after transplantation. His clinical course revealed two phases: Initially, there were mild respiratory symptoms for which he was treated with remdesivir and noninvasive respiratory support. In a second phase with clinical deterioration on postoperative day 22, further respiratory decline led to the administration of convalescent plasma, with satisfactory response and further improvement of his condition.
