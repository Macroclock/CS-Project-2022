Aspergillus galactomannan antigen for diagnosis and treatment monitoring in cerebral aspergillosis. Invasive aspergillosis, especially neuroaspergillosis, predominantly affects immunocompromised patients such as transplant recipients. Early diagnosis and subsequent early initiation of therapy may improve final outcome. In cerebral aspergillosis, samples for culture or histopathology, the diagnostic reference standard, are often impossible to obtain without risk. Because of these limitations, serological, nucleic acid amplification tests such as polymerase chain reaction or enzyme immunoassay from cerebrospinal fluid appear advantageous for early diagnosis and probably also for therapy monitoring. We report on the successful detection and treatment monitoring by serial testing of galactomannan in cerebrospinal fluid in a patient with neuroaspergillosis after heart transplant.
