Immunosuppression with tacrolimus early after orthotopic heart transplantation: a comparison of prograf and advagraf. We compared trough levels and clinical outcomes in patients who received Prograf or Advagraf (tacrolimus) de novo following heart transplantation surgery. Eighty-two patients were included in this follow-up study. Biopsy results were controlled for the first 3 months after orthotopic heart transplantation. Trough levels were monitored for 4 weeks: daily during the first 7 days and once every week thereafter. The lengths of stay in the hospital and in intensive care were compared. The end point of the study was the 1-year mortality rate. We found significant differences between the groups for both biopsy results and trough levels. Trough levels differed for the first 5 days and then converged on the sixth day. The levels remained comparable throughout the monitoring period. The 1-year mortality rates for Prograf and Advagraf were 20% and 15%, respectively. Trough levels were comparable after an adjustment period. There were no differences between the 2 groups in their 1-year mortality rates. These results suggest that Advagraf is a safe alternative to Prograf for patients who have undergone heart transplantation.
