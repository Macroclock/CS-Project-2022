Lung transplantation as an intervention for pediatric pulmonary hypertension. Lung transplantation is a treatment option for selected children with end-stage lung disease and pulmonary vascular disorders. Overall, pulmonary hypertension (PH) is the second most frequent indication for infants and children requiring lung transplants. In pediatric PH patients, timing for listing remains a difficult decision due to patient heterogeneity and varying allocation policies across different countries. Furthermore, perioperative management can be challenging, making interdisciplinary collaboration among surgical, anesthesiology, critical care, and lung transplant teams essential. Because pediatric PH patients typically have preserved cardiac index and exercise tolerance even with advanced disease, they should be referred early even if they do not meet the criteria for listing of primarily adults by International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) published in 2015: New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV without improvement, cardiac index < 2 L/min/m 'children', 'lung transplantation', 'pediatric', 'pulmonary hypertension'
