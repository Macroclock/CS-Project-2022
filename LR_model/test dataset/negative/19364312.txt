Unusual presentation of cytomegalovirus infection in patients after organ transplant. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection has an enormous impact in solid-organ transplant patients. In immunocompromised patients, CMV is associated with well-known direct effects. We herein describe 3 unusual patterns occurring in the setting of tissue-invasive CMV associated with high viral load. Of our 3 cases, the first patient after kidney transplant presented with cholestasis related to radiological cholangitis; the second patient after heart transplant presented with erythema nodosum with CMV infection as the sole cause; and the third patient after kidney transplant presented with acute renal failure related to mild interstitial nephritis with acute tubular necrosis and tubulitis. The first patient's cholestasis resolved with antiviral therapy, as did the erythema nodosum and CMV infection of the heart transplant patient. The third patient's acute renal failure resolved by increased steroid dosage, plasma exchanges, and ganciclovir therapy. These 3 unusual presentations of tissue invasive CMV had favorable outcomes with antiviral therapy.
