Allospecific Memory B Cell Responses Are Dependent on Autophagy. Long-lived, donor-reactive memory B cells (Bmems) can produce alloantibodies that mediate transplant injury. Autophagy, an intrinsic mechanism of cell organelle/component recycling, is required for Bmem survival in infectious and model antigen systems, but whether autophagy affects alloreactive Bmem is unknown. We studied mice with an inducible yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) reporter expressed under the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) promoter active in B cells undergoing germinal center reactions. Up to 12Â months after allogeneic sensitization, splenic YFP 'B cell biology', 'alloantibody', 'alloantigen', 'basic (laboratory) research/science', 'cellular biology', 'desensitization', 'heart transplantation/cardiology', 'immunobiology', 'rejection: antibody-mediated (ABMR)'
