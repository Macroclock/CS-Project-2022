High-resolution phenotyping of early acute rejection reveals a conserved alloimmune signature. Alloimmune responses in acute rejection are complex, involving multiple interacting cell types and pathways. Deep profiling of these cell types has been limited by technology that lacks the capacity to resolve this high dimensionality. Single-cell mass cytometry is used to characterize the alloimmune response in early acute rejection, measuring 37 parameters simultaneously, across multiple time points in two models: a murine cardiac and vascularized composite allotransplant (VCA). Semi-supervised hierarchical clustering is used to group related cell types defined by combinatorial expression of surface and intracellular proteins, along with markers of effector function and activation. This expression profile is mapped to visualize changes in antigen composition across cell types, revealing phenotypic signatures in alloimmune TÂ cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and myeloid subsets that are conserved and that firmly distinguish rejecting from non-rejecting grafts. These data provide a comprehensive, high-dimensional profile of cellular rejection after allograft transplantation.
