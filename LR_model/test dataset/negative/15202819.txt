Percutaneous bridge to heart transplantation by venoarterial ECMO and transaortic left ventricular venting. We report a case in which life support for cardiogenic shock was achieved by a nonpulsatile venoarterial bypass, and left ventricular decompression was obtained by a catheter placed percutaneously through the aortic valve into the left ventricle. The blood drained from the left ventricle was pumped into the femoral artery. The normalization of left heart filling pressures allowed the resolution of pulmonary edema, and the patient underwent a successful heart transplantation following 7 days of mechanical cardiocirculatory support.
