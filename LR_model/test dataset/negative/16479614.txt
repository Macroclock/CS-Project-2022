Cytokine analysis to predict immunosuppression. Recently, it has been realized that TH1/TH2 cytokine production offer the unique possibility to predict drug efficacy. However, there is still an incessant need to explore assay conditions and techniques of analyzing cytokines, which are specific and reliable for monitoring drug efficacy. In this study we used the multiplex bead array technique to detect cytokines of TH1/TH2 cells in whole blood of heart transplanted (HTx) recipients. We found significantly different levels of cytokine expression in HTx recipients compared with cytokine levels in patients prior to HTx. Furthermore, particular cytokine levels were significantly decreased 2 h after drug dosing, compared with cytokine levels before dosing in mitogen-stimulated whole blood. Cytokine analysis with the multiplex array technique in mitogen-stimulated whole blood provides the possibility to predict immunosuppression.
