In vitro and in vivo characterization of AS2643361, a novel and highly potent inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor. Inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase is a critical target in solid organ transplantation. To this end, the development of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) represents a major advance in transplant medicine. Here, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological effects of a novel IMP dehydrogenase inhibitor, AS2643361, in several immunological and non-immunological models. The in vitro inhibitory activity of AS2643361 on immune cell and endothelial cell proliferation and on antibody production from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated B cells, was significantly more potent than that of mycophenolic acid, the active form of MMF, despite the similar potency of these compounds on IMP dehydrogenase. In a rat heterotopic cardiac transplant model, monotherapy using orally administered AS2643361 at 10 or 20mg/kg/day prolonged the median graft survival time from 6 to 16 and 19days, respectively. In dinitrophenol-lipopolysaccharide stimulated rats, oral administration of AS2643361 at 2.5, 5 or 10mg/kg/day resulted in suppression of antibody production. In vivo antibody production against alloantigen was also suppressed by AS2643361 treatment at 5 or 10mg/kg/day. Furthermore, treatment with AS2543361 effectively inhibited balloon injury induced-intimal thickening, which is a major cause of late allograft loss. Overall, the in vivo activity of AS2643361 was over two-fold more potent than that of MMF. In addition, gastrointestinal toxicity, considered a dose-limiting factor for MMF, was reduced with AS2643361 treatment. These results suggest AS2643361 has higher potency and less toxicity than MMF, making it a potential candidate for treatment of acute and chronic rejection in transplant medicine.
