Donor evaluation in heart transplantation: The end of the beginning. The evaluation of organ donors is of critical importance in all areas of solid organ transplantation. Donor characteristics have been shown to have robust effects on heart transplant recipient outcomes, and evaluation of the donor for suitability for heart transplantation is therefore very comprehensive. The donor evaluation process is composed of several steps, beginning with the identification of a potential organ donor and ending with the transplantation of a donor heart. The purpose of this review is to dissect the complex process of donor evaluation into its component steps and to highlight the diverse approaches used by transplant clinicians around the world to optimize outcomes at each step. We provide a summary of donor characteristics that have been associated with increased recipient mortality and discuss areas of uncertainty. Recent additions to the literature present novel insights and solutions to vexing problems in donor evaluation, such as how to make a more accurate assessment of allograft quality. Continued advancement in the evaluation of donors is essential to maintain heart transplantation as a viable therapy that provides excellent long-term survival for patients with end-stage heart failure.
