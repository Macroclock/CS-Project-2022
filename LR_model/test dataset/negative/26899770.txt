Improved heart function from older donors using pharmacologic conditioning strategies. Hearts from older donors are increasingly being referred for transplantation. However, these hearts are more susceptible to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), reflected in higher rates of primary graft dysfunction. We assessed a strategy of pharmacologic conditioning, supplementing Celsior (Genzyme, Naarden, The Netherlands) preservation solution with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN; Hospira Australia Pty, Ltd, Mulgrave, VIC, Australia), erythropoietin (EPO; Eprex; Janssen-Cilag, North Ryde, NSW, Australia), and zoniporide (ZON; Pfizer, Inc., Groton, CT), to protect older hearts against IRI and improve graft function. Wistar rats, aged 3, 12, and 18 months old, were used to represent adolescent, 30-year-old, and 45-year-old human donors, respectively. Animals were subjected to brain death (BD) and hearts stored for 6 hours at 2° to 3°C in Celsior or Celsior supplemented with GTN+EPO+ZON. Cardiac function and lactate dehydrogenase before and after storage were assessed during ex vivo perfusion. Western blots and histopathology were also analyzed. After BD, 18-month hearts demonstrated impaired aortic flow, coronary flow, and cardiac output compared with 3-month hearts (p < 0.001 to p < 0.0001). After storage in Celsior, the recovery of aortic flow, coronary flow, and cardiac output in 18-month BD hearts was further impaired (p < 0.01 vs 3-month hearts). Percentage functional recovery of 18-month BD hearts stored in Celsior supplemented with GTN+EPO+ZON was equivalent to that of 3-month hearts and significantly improved compared with 18-month hearts stored in Celsior alone (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001), with reduced lactate dehydrogenase release (p < 0.01) and myocardial edema (p < 0.05) and elevated phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (p < 0.05) and phosphorylated Akt (p < 0.01). Older hearts are more susceptible to IRI induced by BD and prolonged hypothermic storage. Supplemented Celsior activates cell survival signaling in older hearts, reduces IRI, and enhances donor heart preservation.
