Cardiac transplantation in twins with autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a neuromuscular disorder resulting in progressive muscle weakness, contractures, and cardiomyopathy. We report successful cardiac transplantation in identical twin brothers with autosomal dominant EDMD, complicated by ventricular arrhythmias and end-stage cardiomyopathy. Early recognition of progressive cardiac disease and subsequent cardiac transplantation are lifesaving in children with EDMD.
