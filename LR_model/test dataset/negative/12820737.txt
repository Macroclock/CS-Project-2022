Patient selection for the use of ventricular assist devices as a bridge to transplantation. Patient selection is a critical factor in the outcome associated with the use of mechanical assist devices for the treatment of refractory heart failure/shock. Numerous risk factors impact on the outcome, many of which can be identified and treated before device surgery. This manuscript reviews all the risk factors that have been identified to date and the use of composite risk scores to predict outcome.
