Chemotherapy-Induced Cardiotoxicity in Adolescent After Heart Transplant: Do Not Forget the Right Ventricle. The evaluation of oncologic patients at risk of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity usually focuses on left ventricular function. However, recent studies have demonstrated that right ventricle impairment often coexists (and in some cases precedes) left-side affectation. We present the case of a 19-year-old heart transplant recipient who developed severe right ventricular dysfunction secondary to treatment of an abdominal lymphoma.
