Assessment and treatment of right ventricular failure. Right ventricular (RV) failure is a complex problem with poor outcomes. Diagnosis requires a high degree of clinical suspicion, because many of the signs and symptoms of this condition are nonspecific and can be acute or chronic. Identification of the underlying aetiology, which can include pulmonary hypertension, cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, congenital or valvular heart disease, and sepsis, is essential. Echocardiography is the technique of choice for first-line assessment, but cardiac MRI is the current gold standard for anatomical and functional assessment of the right ventricle. Therapy for RV failure should be directed at the underlying cause, although management of symptoms is also important. Therapeutic options range from pharmacological treatment to mechanical RV support and heart transplantation. The complex 3D geometry of the right ventricle and its intricate interactions with the left ventricle have left many questions about RV failure unanswered. However, promising new targeted therapies are under development and mechanical support is becoming increasingly feasible. The next decade will be an exciting time for advances in our understanding and management of RV failure.
