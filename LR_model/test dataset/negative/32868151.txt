Angiotensin II for Critically Ill Patients With Shock After Heart Transplant. Patients undergoing heart transplant are at high risk for vasodilatory shock in the postoperative period, due to a combination of vascular dysfunction from end-stage heart failure and inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass and, increasingly, long-term exposure to nonpulsatile blood flow in those who have received a left ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplant. Patients who have this vasoplegic syndrome, which may be refractory to traditional agents used in the treatment of shock, are vulnerable to organ dysfunction and death. Angiotensin II (ANG-2) is of increasing interest as an adjunct to traditional therapy, both for improvement in blood pressure and for sparing the use of high-dose catecholamine vasopressors. This case series describes the use of ANG-2 in 4 clinical scenarios for the treatment of shock due to heart transplant surgery, supporting its use in this role and justifying further prospective studies to clarify the appropriate place for ANG-2 in the hierarchy of adjunctive therapies.
