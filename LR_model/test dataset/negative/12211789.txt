Worldwide thoracic organ transplantation: a report from the UNOS/ISHLT international registry for thoracic organ transplantation. Based on data reported to the UNOS/ISHLT Thoracic and International Registry for Thoracic Organ Transplantation: 1. The number of heart transplant operations performed in the United States decreased between 1998-1999 and 17 (1%) more procedures were performed in 1999 (2,181) than in 2000 (2,198). Sixty-nine more lung transplants (an 8% increase) were reported in 2000 than in 1999. 2. Coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy were the most frequently cited indications for heart transplantation in the US and have been reported at similar rates during the past 10 years. Combined, these diagnoses account for approximately 85% of all heart transplants. In 2000, half of all lung transplants were performed for emphysema/COPD or alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The most frequently reported diagnoses for thoracic transplantation outside the US were: cardiomyopathy (49%) for heart, cystic fibrosis (30%) for double lung, emphysema/COPD (34%) for single lung and primary pulmonary hypertension (21%) for heart-lung transplants. 3. US heart transplant recipients were predominately male (76%), aged 50-64 (51%) and white (81%). US lung transplant recipients were also predominately between ages 50-64 (47%) and white (90%), but unlike heart recipients were more likely to be female (51%). No meaningful variance from the US recipient demographic profile was noted for the non-US recipients during the same time period. 4. Pediatric recipients (< 18 years of age) received 11% of the reported heart transplants and 6% of the reported lung transplants in the US. 5. Among US thoracic transplant recipients during 1999, the one-year survival rates were 84% for heart, 59% for heart-lung and 77% for lung. The 5-year survival rates for transplants performed during 1995 were: 71% for heart, 56% for heart-lung and 44% for lung transplants. 6. The long-term patient survival rates were: 23% at 19 years for heart, 16% at 11 years for lung and 23% at 14 years for heart-lung recipients. 7. During the first year after transplantation, 66% of heart recipients and 44% of lung recipients did not require rehospitalization. Among those recipients who were rehospitalized, the major cause was infection.
