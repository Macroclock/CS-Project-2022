Heart transplantation ten-year follow-ups: Deformation differentiation comparison of myocardial performance in left ventricle and right ventricle. We try to investigate whether the values of three-dimensional principal longitudinal strain present differently between the left and right ventricles in patients with long-time follow-ups after heart transplantation (HTx). Transthoracic echocardiography with three-dimensional speckle tracking was performed at one-, five- and ten-year follow-ups in 62 "healthy" HTx patients together with routine echocardiographic evaluation in 32 control group (CG) individuals. Longitudinal strain was applied in all subjects assessing without myocardium wall motion abnormality. Firstly, left ventricular ejection fraction preserved in HTx and had no significant difference in comparison with the controls (p > .05). 3D measurement showed obvious reduction in global (%: CG: -20.5 ± 3.5 vs. HT1y: -13.7 ± 4.6, HT5y: -14.4 ± 4.5, HT10y: -14.6 ± 4.7. p < .01) and horizontal segmental (basal, mid, apical, CG vs. HTx: all p < .01) strain values of the left compared HTx with control subjects. Secondly, tissue Doppler imaging s' velocity and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion reduced in HTx as compared to the controls in right ventricle (p < .01). Longitudinal strain presented a more distinctive reduction in global (%: CG: -24.5 ± 4.6 vs. HT1y:-14.8 ± 7.5, HT5y: -15.5 ± 6.4, HT10y: -15.9 ± 6.8. p < .01) and horizontal segmental (basal, mid, apical, CG vs. HTx: all p < .01) average values of the right compared HTx with control subjects. Thirdly, there weren't any significant changes between one-, five- and ten-year of all the values with HTx inter-group comparison in both the left and right ventricles (p > .05). Fourthly, the global and segmental strain of the right ventricle decreased more than that of the left ventricle in all HTx groups, with the global decreased differentiation rates of 7%, 7%, 6%, respectively. Compared HTx with control subjects in both ventricles, conventional evaluation showed preserved or decreased functions in the left and right separately. Myocardial function evaluating by 3D longitudinal strain reduced after HTx, but the deformation of the right ventricle reduced more than those of the left ventricle. Additionally, 3D strain values almost remained with stable decreased differentiation rates during the long-time follow-ups.
