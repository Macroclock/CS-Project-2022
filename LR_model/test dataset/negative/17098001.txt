Variations in the frequency and type of infections in heart transplantation according to the immunosuppression regimen. To evaluate the frequency of infection according to the immunosuppressive regimens used in our center. From 259 consecutive heart transplants we excluded pediatric cases, retransplants, combined transplants (lung and kidney) and immunosuppressive regimens with fewer than 10 cases. The six groups analyzed were: (1) OKT3 (7 days) + cyclosporine (CsA) + mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) + steroids (S); (2) OKT3 (7 days) + CsA + azathioprine (AZA) + S; (3) OKT3 (10 days) + CsA + MMF + S; (4) OKT3 (10 days) + CsA + AZA + S; (5) interleukin-2 (IL-2) antagonists + CsA + MMF + S; (6) IL-2 antagonists + tacrolimus + MMF + S. Infection was considered significant when it causal hospital admission or prolonged hospitalization. With a total mean follow-up of 54 +/- 43 months, the total percentage of infection-free patients at the end of follow-up was 45.5%. Infection-free survival was lower among patients administered induction with OKT3 antibodies for 10 days, combined with cyclosporine, either with MMF (10%, group 3) or with azathioprine (27%, group 4), compared to those given IL-2 antagonists (particularly in combination with tacrolimus and MMF-69.2%, group 6). The results of this study showed that infection was frequent in heart transplantation. Furthermore, induction therapy with OKT3 monoclonal antibodies was associated with an important number of infections (particularly viral infections). Comparison of the treatment groups showed that the regimen associated with fever infections included an IL-2 receptor antagonist with tacrolimus, MMF, and S.
