Results after transplantation using donor hearts with preexisting coronary artery disease. Cardiac allografts with coronary artery disease may permit a selective expansion of the donor pool. Twenty-two recipients who received donor hearts with mild to moderate coronary artery disease on angiography were reviewed. All donor organs had preserved left ventricle function on echocardiogram. The procedure was explained to the patients in detail. All survivors have at least 1 year of follow-up. If the coronary arteries of the donor heart were significantly occluded, then the implanting surgeon performed coronary revascularization. Donors were allocated to patients facing imminent death (group I, n = 4) or to those who would otherwise not have been transplanted (group II, n = 18). Median recipient age was 57 years old for group I and 68 years old for group II. Median follow-up was 25 months for group I and 44 for group II. Outcome was evaluated using survival and freedom from graft coronary disease as end points. In group I, 3 of the 4 hearts required revascularization. In group II, 10 of the 18 required revascularization. The majority of the revascularizations were recipient saphenous vein grafts (84.6%) to the donor left anterior descending artery (50%). The 1-month and 2-year actual survivals for group I are 75% and 50% and 87.5% and 81.3 for group II. One patient in group I who was in extremis and 3 in group II died at less than 90 days. Group II early deaths had donor risk factor combinations of coronary artery disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and long distance. Freedom from new graft coronary artery disease was 100% at 2 years in group I and 87.5% in group II. Selective use of donor hearts with coronary artery disease is acceptable. Early deaths are related to recipient factors as well as associated donor risk factors. Donor hearts with mild or moderate coronary artery disease and preserved function on echocardiogram can be used but may require revascularization with recipient conduit and/or percutaneous transluminal coronary artery angioplasty. Coronary disease in donor hearts requires grading and does not categorically preclude use, particularly in risk-matched recipients.
