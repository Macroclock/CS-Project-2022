[The role of some selected risk factors in the development of the nephrotoxicity of immunosuppressive medications used after the heart transplantation in children and young adults]. The goal of this research was the assessment of non-genetic and genetic risk factors of renal lesions in children after heart transplants. The research was carried out in 22 pediatric heart transplant recipients who have had a long-term treatment with calcineurin inhibitors. Renal function was assessed directly after the transplantation and then in 3 months intervals with the monitoring of calcineurin inhibitors concentration in the plasma. A significant renal lesion has been confirmed, which was a time-function in all examined patients, although its severity varied. Acute renal insufficiency, transplant rejection and ATG usage in the peri-transplant and the post-transplant periods have not proven to influence the complications mentioned above. The relationship between "high TGFbeta production genotype" and the intensity of nephrotoxicity of calcineurin inhibitors has been confirmed.
