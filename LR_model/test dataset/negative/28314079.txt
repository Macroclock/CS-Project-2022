Low serum testosterone is associated with impaired graft function early after heart transplantation. We sought to investigate a correlation between serum testosterone levels and graft function early after heart transplantation. In a cross-sectional study, we measured serum testosterone levels 4 weeks after heart transplantation in 49 consecutive male recipients. Echocardiography was carried out to evaluate graft function. Low serum testosterone was defined as <11 nmol/L. Low serum testosterone was present in 21 (43%) recipients (Group A), and 28 (57%) had normal testosterone levels (Group B). The two groups did not differ in age and presence of renal dysfunction, arterial hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia. Donor age and allograft ischemic time were not different between the two groups. Both groups had comparable tacrolimus through levels, dose of mycophenolate mophetil, and methylprednisolone. Patients in Group A had significantly lower LVEF (58±5% vs 65±6% vs Group B, P=.001) and TAPSE (1.3±0.3 cm vs 1.6±0.3 cm in Group B, P=.01). In comparison with Group B, more patients in Group A were found to have low grade (1R) rejection (25% vs 3%; P=.02). Low serum testosterone levels appear to be associated with impaired graft function and an increased incidence of low-grade rejection episodes early after heart transplantation.
