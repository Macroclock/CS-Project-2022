Circulating miR-181a-5p as a new biomarker for acute cellular rejection in heart transplantation. Acute cellular rejection (ACR) is a major complication in heart transplantation (HTx). Endomyocardial biopsy is the reference method for early detection of ACR, but a new non-invasive approach is needed. Tentative candidates could be circulating microRNAs. This study aimed to discover and validate microRNAs in serum for ACR detection after HTx. This prospective, observational, single-center study included 121 HTx patients. ACR was graded according to International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation classification (0R-3R). First, in the discovery phase, microRNA expression profile was carried out in serum samples from patients at pre-rejection, during, and post-rejection time (0R A total of 21 ACR episodes (0R miR-185a-5p in serum is a candidate as a non-invasive ACR biomarker (area under the curve = 0.80 and negative predicted value = 98%). Thus, this biomarker could reduce the need for endomyocardial biopsies and the associated risks and costs of this invasive procedure.
