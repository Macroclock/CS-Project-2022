Bone fractures after cardiac transplantation. Bone loss and bone fractures are disabling complications after heart transplantation. Severe bone loss happens mainly during the first year posttransplantation. Steroids and cyclosporine alter bone metabolism in several ways. To counterbalance these effects, antiresorptive therapy is provided to these patients. The objective of this study was to assess the frequency of bone fractures after heart transplantation, considering previous comorbidities, immunosuppressive therapy, and osteoprotective treatment. From 1993 to 2005, 443 consecutive heart transplant recipients were followed for the occurrence of bone fractures, immunosuppressive therapy, clinical conditions, and antiresorptive treatment. There were 41 fractures in 34 patients (7.6%, group I). The remainder of patients formed group II. Fractures commonly involved the lumbar spine. Postmenopausal women had more fractures than other patients (20.6% vs 7.8%, P = .02). When the initial immunosuppressive regimen included tacrolimus, fractures did not happen (P = .01, vs other regimens). Osteoprotective therapy was administered to 91.2% of patients in group I and 79% in group II (P = .08). Mean interval from transplantation to the first fracture was 1131.5 days. Overweight patients had a 61.8% incidence of fracture. Our series showed a low frequency of bone fractures. Postmenopausal women and overweight patients had more fractures. An initial immunosuppressive regimen using tacrolimus was associated with lower fracture rates.
