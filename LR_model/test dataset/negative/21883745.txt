Severe calcification of the aorta (porcelain aorta) associated with sarcoidosis in a pediatric heart transplant recipient. We report a unique case of severe calcification of the aorta, bilateral coronary ostial stenoses and calcification of the mitral valve and left ventricle due to sarcoidosis. The patient underwent neonatal orthotopic heart transplantation secondary to hypoplastic left heart syndrome and developed hypercalcemia with other features of sarcoidosis at 10 yr of age. The mechanism for severe extra-renal calcification localized to the allograft is poorly understood, but may involve discordant local immune modulation and/or calcification-regulation between graft and host tissues.
