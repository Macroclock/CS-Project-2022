Recipient gene polymorphisms in the Th-1 cytokines IL-2 and IFN-gamma in relation to acute rejection and graft vascular disease after clinical heart transplantation. IL-2 and IFN-gamma are associated with acute rejection (AR) and graft vascular disease (GVD) after clinical heart transplantation. Polymorphisms in the genes of IL-2 (T-330G in the promoter) and IFN-gamma (CA repeat in the first intron) influence the production levels of these cytokines. Therefore, these polymorphisms might have an effect on the outcome after transplantation. To investigate possible effects of genetic variations in IL-2 and IFN-gamma genes on AR and GVD, we analyzed the IL-2 T-330G and the IFN-gamma CA repeat polymorphism in DNA of 301 heart transplant recipients. No associations were found for allele or genotype distributions between patients with or without AR (IL-2 allele frequency: P=0.44, genotype distribution: P=0.46; IFN-gamma allele frequency P=0.10, genotype distribution 12 repeats allele: P=0.21). Also, no associations were found analyzing the number (0 vs. 1 vs. >or=1) of AR (IL-2 allele frequency: P=0.59; genotype distribution: P=0.37; IFN-gamma allele frequency: P=0.27, genotype distribution 12 repeats allele: P=0.41) or analyzing the polymorphisms in patients with AR within the first month or thereafter (IL-2 allele frequency: P=0.45, genotype distribution: P=0.38; IFN-gamma allele frequency: P=0.21, genotype distribution 12 repeats allele: P=0.41). Analyzing both polymorphisms in relation to GVD, resulted in comparable allele and genotype distributions (IL-2 allele frequency: P=0.75; genotype distribution: P=0.77; IFN-gamma allele frequency: P=0.70, genotype distribution 12 repeats allele: P=0.63). In conclusion, we did not detect an association between the IL-2 T-330G promoter polymorphism and CA repeat polymorphism in the first intron of the IFN-gamma gene and AR or GVD after heart transplantation.
