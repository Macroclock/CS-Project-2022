Gas6 promotes inflammation by enhancing interactions between endothelial cells, platelets, and leukocytes. The role of Gas6 in endothelial cell (EC) function remains incompletely characterized. Here we report that Gas6 amplifies EC activation in response to inflammatory stimuli in vitro. In vivo, Gas6 promotes and accelerates the sequestration of circulating platelets and leukocytes on activated endothelium as well as the formation and endothelial sequestration of circulating platelet-leukocyte conjugates. In addition, Gas6 promotes leukocyte extravasation, inflammation, and thrombosis in mouse models of inflammation (endotoxinemia, vasculitis, heart transplantation). Thus, Gas6 amplifies EC activation, thereby playing a key role in enhancing the interactions between ECs, platelets, and leukocytes during inflammation.
