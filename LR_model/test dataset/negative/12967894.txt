[Alternative approaches in the end-stage heart failure]. Cardiac transplantation has emerged as the therapeutic procedure of choice for patients with end-stage heart disease but the availability of donor organs remains major limiting factor allowing only 1% of the candidates actually become transplant recipients. New therapeutic strategies are under intensive research for patients who do not meet patient selection criteria for transplantation or who suffer from donor organ shortage. Even though there are significant developments in the medical treatment of cardiac failure, the prognosis of this condition continues to be poor. The 20-40% of the candidates for cardiac transplantation die while they are included in the waiting list. Twenty percent mortality has been reported within the first year of transplantation with additional yearly mortality of 5% following the first year. Financial constraints, complications of immunosuppression and functional failure of the transplanted hearts are other limiting factors. This has brought up the necessity to search for alternative surgical treatment methods besides increasing the waiting periods of transplant candidates. The aim of this report is to summarize other currently available therapeutic alternatives for patients with end-stage cardiac disease.
