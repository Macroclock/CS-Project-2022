[Noninvasive methods for the diagnosis of rejection after heart transplantation]. Acute rejection is a major complication after heart transplantation. Prognosis depends on early detection and effective treatment. Currently, the most reliable technique for the detection of acute cardiac rejection is endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). Because of invasive procedure, it is not suitable for daily monitoring. If the pattern of rejection shows a focal distribution, false-negative results can be expected. So far, many studies were performed to evaluate diagnostic value of noninvasive procedures in acute rejection, but none of them was found to be superior to EMB. Value of different noninvasive procedures in the diagnosis of acute rejection after heart transplantation is discussed in this review.
