Role of angiogenic growth factors in transplant coronary artery disease. Transplant coronary artery disease (TxCAD) as a manifestation of chronic rejection is a major limitation to long-term survival of heart transplant recipients. Although the exact molecular and cellular mechanisms contributing to neointimal formation are unknown, it has been generally believed that smooth muscle cells (SMC) of donor origin migrate from the media into the subendothelial layer of the vascular wall, where SMC proliferate and synthesize extracellular matrix resulting in intimal thickening. However, recent observations indicate that hematopoietic and vascular progenitor cells derived from recipient bone marrow may contribute to the arteriosclerotic lesion formation in the coronary arteries of the transplant. On the other hand, studies on postnatal hematopoiesis indicate that angiogenic growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) may regulate the recruitment of these cells into distant organs. Furthermore, embryonic VEGFR-2 /CD34+ stem cells may serve as vascular progenitor cells and their differentiation into endothelial cells and SMC may be regulated by VEGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), respectively. In this review, we discuss the role of angiogenic growth factors such as VEGF, Ang, and PDGF in the recruitment of hematopoietic and vascular progenitor cells in TxCAD and suggest novel therapies targeted at homing, differentiation and proliferation of these cells in the allograft.
