Microarray analysis of gene expression in murine cardiac graft infiltrating cells. Microarray technology can rapidly generate large databases of gene expression profiles. Our laboratory has applied these techniques to analyze differential gene expression in cardiac tissue and cells based on mouse heart transplantation. We have analyzed the different gene expression profiles such as stress or injury including ischemia following transplantation. We also have investigated the role of infiltrating inflammatory cells during graft rejection by purifying subsets of infiltrating cells using GFP transgenic mice and detailed all technical experiences and issues. The purpose of this study is to assist researchers to simplify the process of analyzing large database using microarray technology.
