Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: successful bridge to pediatric heart transplantation. Since the year 2000, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support for cardiac failure has been employed in the post operative care of children at the Centro Cardiovascular de Puerto Rico y el Caribe. Our experience with the application of ECMO had been limited to circulatory support after repair of congenital cardiac lesions. We report the first case in Puerto Rico where ECMO was used successfully as bridge to pediatric heart transplantation.
