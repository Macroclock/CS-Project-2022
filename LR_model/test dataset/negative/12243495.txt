Induction of donor-specific allograft tolerance by short-term treatment with LF15-0195 after transplantation. Evidence for a direct effect on T-cell differentiation. A 20-day treatment with LF15-0195, a deoxyspergualine analog, induced long-term heart allograft survival in the rat without signs of chronic rejection. LF15-0195-treated recipients did not develop an anti-donor alloantibody response. Analysis of graft-infiltrating cells, IL10, TNFalpha, IFNgamma mRNA and iNOS protein expression in allografts, 5 days after transplantation, showed that they were markedly decreased in allografts from LF15-0195-treated recipients compared with allografts from untreated recipients. Surprisingly, spleen T cells from LF15-0195 recipients, 5days after grafting, were able to proliferate strongly in vitro, when stimulated with donor cells, but had reduced mRNA expression for IFNy compared with spleen T cells from untreated graft recipients. Furthermore, when T cells from naive animals were stimulated in vitro, using anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, LF15-0195 also increased T-cell proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion: however, these cells expressed less of the Th1 -related cytokines, IFNgamma and IL2, compared with untreated cells, suggesting that LF15-0195 could act on T-cell differentiation. In conclusion, we show here that a short-term treatment with LF15-0195 induced long-term allograft tolerance, decreasing the in situ anti-donor response, and we illustrate evidence for the development of regulatory mechanisms.
