Pulmonary Artery Banding for Children With Dilated Cardiomyopathy: US Experience. Pulmonary artery band placement is a recently described therapeutic strategy for dilated cardiomyopathy with preserved right ventricular function, originally reported from Germany.1 We present the results of the multicenter retrospective study of pulmonary artery band experience in the United States, with comparison to the German experience. Five centers contributed a total 14 patients (median age 5 months, interquartile range 3.5-10). Mechanical ventilation was required in 9/12 (75%) patients and inotropes were used in 13/14 (93%) patients preoperatively. Ultimately, 4 (29%) patients experienced cardiac recovery, 8 (57%) were bridged to cardiac transplantation (6 with ventricular assist device placement), and 2 (14%) died. Although both the US and Germany series demonstrated high prevalence of achieving patients' individual target (either cardiac recovery or transplant), the mode of success was different (recovery rate: <1/3 in the United States and >2/3 in Germany). Lower recovery rate may be a reflection of sicker preoperative status, and thereby a more advanced stage of heart failure (preoperative intubation: >2/3 in the United States vs <1/3 in Germany). Further studies would be warranted to gain more insight into patient selection as well as optimal timing for the intervention. 'Cardiomyopathy', 'Pulmonary artery band', 'Reverse remodeling'
