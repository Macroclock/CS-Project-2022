Factors Related to the Acute Cellular Rejection During the First Year After Heart Transplant. The acute cellular rejection is recognized as a factor related to the long-term viability of the heart graft. We intend to establish which factors are associated with the acute cellular rejection during the first year post heart transplant using a longitudinal model with repeated measures. A retrospective cohort study was performed with all the patients who underwent heart transplant between 2005-2018 at the Hospital Universitario San Ignacio in Bogota, Colombia. In order to determine the factors associated with the development of acute cellular rejection, a generalized estimating equation approach was used, with an interchangeable correlation structure. The lowest value of quasi-likelihood information criterion and P < .05 was considered significant. Fifty-five patients (49.3 ± 11.1 years old) were included. The mortality during the first month was 16.3% and the accumulated mortality during the first year was 23.6%. The incidence of the acute cellular rejection was higher during the third month after the transplant (79.9%); most of them were acute cellular rejection grade 1. The factors associated with the development of the rejection were the cyclosporine levels out of the therapeutic range in several periods of evaluation (P < .03) and the age of the receptor (P = .049). Using advanced modeling methodologies of longitudinal data we identified that the factors associated with acute cellular rejection during the first year after the transplant are related to the therapeutic levels of the calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporin) during the first 6 months of follow-up and the age of the receptor.
