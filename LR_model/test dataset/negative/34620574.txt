Ex vivo perfusion of the donor heart: Preliminary experience in high-risk transplantations. The number of heart transplantations (HTs) has decreased in France since 2017 (-5%/year) despite a stable rate of patients referred on the waiting list. Ex vivo heart perfusion (EVHP) is an innovative approach for organ preservation, reducing graft ischaemic time and facilitating continuous organ monitoring before transplantation. To report our preliminary experience of seven donor hearts preserved with EVHP, including the first heart resuscitated after circulatory-determined death in France. Seven hearts were procured from donation after brain death (DBD) for HT or donation after circulatory-determined death (DCD) for research purposes (Protocol PFS20-004, Agence de la Biomédecine, La Plaine Saint-Denis, France). All grafts were preserved using the Organ Care System® (TransMedics Inc., Andover, MA, USA) for normothermic EVHP. Perfusion parameters were adjusted to achieve stable or decreasing arterial lactate trend consistent with suitability for organ transplantation. Indications for EVHP were assessment of a marginal graft in four cases, prolonged preservation in two cases (anticipated duration for retrieval of recipient's heart>3hours) and resuscitation after circulatory-determined death in one case. Median duration of EVHP was 270 (interquartile range 216-343) minutes. five were transplanted, with a median ex situ preservation time (ischaemic time+EVHP time) of 334 (interquartile range 326-444) minutes. The two other grafts were discarded for HT. Three recipients had extracorporeal life support after HT, and presented complete cardiac recovery within a week after HT. One patient died at day 11 because of septic shock. The 3-month survival rate was 75% among recipients. Three months after HT, the left ventricular ejection fraction was>60% in all cases. EVHP enabled safe prolonged preservation and assessment of marginal grafts. This approach provides an opportunity to expand the donor pool by resuscitating grafts from donors with extended criteria, including controlled DCD.
