Is severe electrolyte imbalance a contraindication for heart transplant? Owing to the increasing numbers of patients with end-stage congestive heart failure awaiting heart transplant and the limited number of suitable donor organs, a decrease in stringency of donor criteria has become widely accepted over the last decade. Here, we present a case of a heart donor with severe electrolyte imbalance, specifically severe hypokalemia, and severe hypernatremia. Despite this, heart transplant was a success, and the recipient was discharged from the hospital in good general condition. We recommend further study of this issue with a larger sample size.
