Cardiac allograft vasculopathy following fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent C. difficile infection. We report the case of a 3-year-old male who developed recurrent Clostridium difficile infection after receiving an orthotopic heart transplant. Despite multiple courses of antibiotics, C. difficile infection was persistent and he underwent a fecal microbiota transplant. The patient responded with resolution of his diarrhea. However, within 2 months he developed severe mixed rejection with high circulating donor-specific antibodies and significant coronary vasculopathy. Organ dysfunction led to the need for re-transplantation. The patient's postoperative course has since been complicated by pneumatosis intestinalis and recurrent C. difficile infection.
