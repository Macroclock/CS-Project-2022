The International Thoracic Organ Transplant Registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: Thirty-eighth adult lung transplantation report - 2021; Focus on recipient characteristics. For over 30 years, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) International Thoracic Organ Transplant (TTX) Registry has gathered data regarding transplant procedures, donor and recipient characteristics, and outcomes from a global community of transplant centers. Almost 70,000 adult lung transplant procedures have been reported to the Registry since its inception, each one providing an opportunity for a recipient with end-stage lung disease to regain quality of life and longevity. With each year's report, we provide more detailed analyses on a particular focus theme important to recipient outcomes. Since 2013, these have been donor and recipient age; retransplantation; early graft failure; indication for transplant; allograft ischemic time; multiorgan transplantation; and donor and recipient size matching.
