Absolute and Functional Iron Deficiency Is a Common Finding in Patients With Heart Failure and After Heart Transplantation. Anemia is relatively common in patients with heart failure and heart transplant recipients. Both absolute and functional iron deficiency may contribute to the anemia in these populations. Functional iron deficiency (defined as ferritin greater than 200 ng/mL with TSAT (Transferrin saturation) less than 20%) is characterized by the presence of adequate iron stores as defined by conventional criteria, but with insufficient iron mobilization to adequately support. The aim of this study was to determine prevalence of absolute and functional iron deficiency in patients with heart failure (n = 269) and after heart transplantation (n = 130) and their relation to parameters of iron status and inflammation. Iron status, complete blood count, and creatinine levels were assessed using standard laboratory methods. C-reactive protein, hepcidin and hemojuvelin were measured using commercially available kits. Absolute iron deficiency was present in 15% of patients with heart failure and 30% in heart transplant recipients, whereas functional iron deficiency was present in 18% of patients with heart failure and 17% in heart transplant recipients. Functional iron deficiency was associated with significantly higher C-reactive protein and hepcidin levels in heart failure patients, and higher hepcidin and lower estimate glomerular filtration rates in heart transplant recipients. Prevalence of anemia (according to the World Health Organization) was significantly higher in heart transplant recipients (40% vs 22%, P < .001), they were also younger, but with worse kidney function than patients with heart failure. Both absolute and functional iron deficiency were present in a considerable group of patients. This population should be carefully screened for possible reversible causes of inflammation.
