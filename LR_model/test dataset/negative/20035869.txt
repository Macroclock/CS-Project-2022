Expression of CXCR6 on CD8(+) T cells was up-regulated in allograft rejection. CXCL16/SR-PSOX is a novel transmembrane-type chemokine, which was also identified as a novel scavenger receptor for oxidized low density lipoprotein. Its receptor CXCR6 expresses on activated CD8(+) T cells, type 1-polarized CD4(+), and constitutively expresses on NKT cells. Moreover, it has been shown that CXCL16 accumulated activated CD8(+) T cells to sites of inflammation. To date, the effect of CXCL16 (SR-PSOX)/CXCR6 on CD8(+) T cells and its role in allograft rejection/acceptance are not well understood. In the current study, we show that rejected allografts showed higher expressions of CXCR6 and CXCL16. More importantly, expression of CXCR6 on CD8(+) T cells was also up-regulated by rejection. However, the blockade of CXCL16(SR-PSOX)/CXCR6 interaction could not inhibit cytotoxic activity of CD8(+) T cells, and therefore, could not prolong the cardiac graft survival time.
