Quantitative 3D Analysis of Coronary Wall Morphology in Heart Transplant Patients: OCT-Assessed Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy Progression. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) accounts for about 30% of all heart-transplant (HTx) patient deaths. For patients at high risk for CAV complications after HTx, therapy must be initiated early to be effective. Therefore, new phenotyping approaches are needed to identify such HTx patients at the earliest possible time. Coronary optical coherence tomography (OCT) images were acquired from 50 HTx patients 1 and 12 months after HTx. Quantitative analysis of coronary wall morphology used LOGISMOS segmentation strategy to simultaneously identify three wall-layer surfaces for the entire pullback length in 3D: luminal, outer intimal, and outer medial surfaces. To quantify changes of coronary wall morphology between 1 and 12 months after HTx, the two pullbacks were mutually co-registered. Validation of layer thickness measurements showed high accuracy of performed layer analyses with layer thickness measures correlating well with manually-defined independent standard (R 'CAV prediction', 'CAV progression', 'Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV)', 'LOGISMOS', 'optical coherence tomography (OCT)'
