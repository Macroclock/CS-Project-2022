Five-year results of heart rate control with ivabradine or metoprolol succinate in patients after heart transplantation. Cardiac graft denervation causes inadequate sinus tachycardia in patients after heart transplantation (HTX) which is associated with reduced survival. This study investigated the 5-year results of heart rate control with ivabradine or metoprolol succinate in patients after HTX. This registry study analyzed 104 patients receiving either ivabradine (n = 50) or metoprolol succinate (n = 54) within 5 years after HTX. Analysis included patient characteristics, medication, echocardiographic features, cardiac catheterization data, cardiac biomarkers, heart rates, and post-transplant survival including causes of death. Demographics and post-transplant medication revealed no significant differences except for ivabradine and metoprolol succinate use. At 5-year follow-up, patients with ivabradine had a significantly lower heart rate (73.3 bpm) compared to baseline (88.6 bpm; P < 0.01) and to metoprolol succinate (80.4 bpm; P < 0.01), a reduced left ventricular mass (154.8 g) compared to baseline (179.5 g; P < 0.01) and to metoprolol succinate (177.3 g; P < 0.01), a lower left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP; 12.0 mmHg) compared to baseline (15.5 mmHg; P < 0.01) and to metoprolol succinate (17.1 mmHg; P < 0.01), and a reduced NT-proBNP level (525.4 pg/ml) compared to baseline (3826.3 pg/ml; P < 0.01) and to metoprolol succinate (1038.9 pg/ml; P < 0.01). Five-year post-transplant survival was significantly better in patients with ivabradine (90.0%) versus metoprolol succinate (68.5%; P < 0.01). Patients receiving ivabradine showed a superior heart rate reduction and a better left ventricular diastolic function along with an improved 5-year survival after HTX.
