The MDR1 polymorphisms at exons 21 and 26 predict steroid weaning in pediatric heart transplant patients. Various polymorphisms of the MDR1 gene that encodes for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a transmembrane pump, have been identified. A silent mutation C3435T in exon 26 and a G2677T mutation in exon 21 have been correlated with P-gp expression and function in humans. The objectives of this study were (a) to determine whether the MDR1 exon 21 and exon 26 polymorphisms were related to steroid weaning in a pediatric heart transplant (HTx) population, and (b) to determine whether an association exist between the MDR1 exon 21 and exon 26 polymorphisms in these patients. Sixty-nine pediatric HTx patients were studied. MDR1 genotyping was determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification, sequencing the DNA, and sequence evaluation using Polyphred software (University of Washington) to identify genotypes. The steroid dose at 1 year post-transplantation was recorded. For steroid weaning at one year post-HTx for MDR1 C3435T, 12 of 18 (67%) patients in the CC genotype were still on prednisone, whereas only 18 of 47 (38%) of the CT/TT group were still receiving prednisone (p = 0.04). Similar results were observed for the MDR1 G2677T genotyping and steroid weaning. Forty-three of 46 patients (93.5%) who have MDR1 C3435T allele also have a mutant G2677T allele (p < 0.001). We conclude that (a) a significantly larger number of MDR1 3435 CC HTx patients remain on steroids at 1 year after transplantation, and (b) the MDR1 C3435T genotype is associated with the G2677 genotype in pediatric HTx patients.
