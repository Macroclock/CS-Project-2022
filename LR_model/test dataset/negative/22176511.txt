Donor-derived Coccidioides immitis fungemia in solid organ transplant recipients. We report disseminated coccidioidomycosis in 3 transplant recipients from a donor in an endemic area found to have unrecognized meningeal coccidioidomycosis. All 3 transplant recipients presented within 3 weeks of receipt of their organ. Only 1 organ recipient survived the acute presentation of coccidioidomycosis. Serologic testing for Coccidioides immitis infection should be considered for organ donors residing in endemic areas.
