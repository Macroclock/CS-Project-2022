Current status of cardiac transplantation and mechanical circulatory support. Cardiac transplantation and mechanical circulatory support are possible options for improving survival and quality of life in patients with isolated cardiac disease and end-stage heart failure. Transplantation is limited by donor availability but has a median survival of 10 years. Post-transplant immunosuppression is often transplant center dependent, but a tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil-based regimen may be preferred. Sirolimus may reduce the progression rate of transplant vasculopathy. There has been a trend toward continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices because of their increased durability and reduced size. A variety of surgical and percutaneous ventricular assist devices may be used as a bridge to decision on a patient's candidacy for transplantation. Mechanical circulatory support as destination therapy has not been widely implemented because of poor device durability, but this is expected to change with newer devices. Mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to myocardial recovery has been successful only in a few patients.
