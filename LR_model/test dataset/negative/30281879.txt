Heart transplantation for infective endocarditis: Viable option for a limited few? Active infection in the recipient is considered a relative contraindication for solid organ transplantation. However, heart transplantation (HT) can be curative in patients with ventricular assist device infections. For patients with infective endocarditis (IE), valve replacement is part of the management strategy based on emergent, acute, or elective indications. HT has been utilized as an uncommon and sporadic treatment option for carefully selected patients with refractory or recurrent IE after all other surgical treatment options have been exhausted or are not feasible. Herein, we review 19 published cases of IE in whom HT was undertaken in the setting of ongoing active infection with reported good outcomes. We attempt to propose general criteria for HT in the setting of IE and discuss challenges and hurdles that clinicians might encounter when considering HT for active IE in the absence of robust data or clearly defined criteria.
