Role of miR-449a in the Activation and Metabolism of CD4 Acute rejection is a significant challenge after organ transplantation. The CD4 We examined miR-449a expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and graft-infiltrating lymphocytes (GILs) between syngeneic transplant and allogeneic transplant groups on day 7 post‒heart transplantation. We also examined miR-449a expression in CD4 Our in vivo heart transplant models showed that the expression of miR-449a in PBMCs and in GILs significantly increased in the allogeneic groups in comparison to the syngeneic groups (P < .01). Furthermore, in vitro analysis confirmed that the expression of miR-449a was significantly elevated in activated CD4 Our results reveal that miR-449a microRNA was elevated in allogeneic heart allografts. This correlated with an increased miR-449a expression in activated CD4
