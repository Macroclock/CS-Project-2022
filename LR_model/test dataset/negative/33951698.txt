Effect of Inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 Signaling Pathway on the Th17/IL-17 Axis in Acute Cellular Rejection After Heart Transplantation in Mice. Acute immune rejection is one of the most serious complications of heart transplantation, and its mechanism has always been a hot spot. Th17 cells and cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17) have been proved to be involved in acute immune rejection, and the signaling pathway mechanism has attracted our interest. It has been confirmed that the Janus kinase 2-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signaling pathway is involved in the differentiation of CD4+ T cells, so we focus on whether the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway is involved in the occurrence of acute immune rejection by regulating the Th17/IL-17 axis. In this study, we used Bagg's Albino c mice and C57BL/6 mice to construct heterotopic heart transplantation models, which were divided into the acute rejection group and AG490-treated group (n = 5), and donor tissue and serum were collected in 3 experimental days from the recipient mice for H&E staining analysis of paraffin sections and ELISA, Western blot, flow cytometry, and real time-polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that the acute rejection rating of the heart decreased, and the expression of related factors decreased significantly after using the inhibitor AG490, suggesting that the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway regulates expression of the Th17/IL-17 axis in cardiac allograft rejection.
