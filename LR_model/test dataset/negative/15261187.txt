Pregnancy in heart transplant recipients. The aim of this report is to present data from Italian cardiac transplant centers assessing pregnancy after cardiac transplantation. Our retrospective survey included 10 pregnancies occurring in 7 patients during January 1991 to February 2002. Eight pregnancies were completed successfully and 2 abortions were reported (frequency rate 20%). No complications were observed during pregnancy or after delivery. Of 8 infants studied, 6 (75%) were born at term and 2 (25%) pre-term. One baby presented congenital talipes valgus. Pediatric development was uneventful. The data from the literature and our series show that a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory. The course of pregnancy is usually normal and the maternal and fetal outcomes are usually favorable. Although no fetal malformations have been reported, prolonged follow-up of these infants is required.
