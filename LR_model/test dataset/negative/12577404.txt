[The first heart-lung transplantation in a Hungarian patient with cystic fibrosis]. Progressive lung disease and respiratory insufficiency is the leading cause of early death for patients with cystic fibrosis. Successful heart-lung transplantation was performed in the 24 years old man with cystic fibrosis for end stage lung diseases and for concomitant dilatative cardiomyopathy. Six months following the operation the patient returned to full-time his job, and leads an active life like other fellow-men of his age. The attention is called with this case report to a rarely necessary intervention available for Hungarian patients as well. The criteria of the lung transplantation in cystic fibrosis, the preoperative screening and the tasks of the postoperative care are summarised.
