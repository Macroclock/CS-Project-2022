[Ventricular assist device as alternative to heart transplant in a hospitalized patient in an intensive care unit: clinical case]. To present and analyze a clinical case that addresses the care plan for a patient with permanent ventricular assist in an intensive care unit (ICU). CLINICAL CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old man admitted to an ICU in a tertiary teaching hospital in September 2011 after receiving an implant of a permanent ventricular assist device (Heartmate II). The case analysis has been structured into 3 categories identified in the review of the literature: prevention of risks and complications, management of the device and health education. This study shows the importance of establishing a protocolized care plan for the patients who are carriers of permanent ventricular assist in the ICU. This would avoid postoperative complications, reduce costs and hospitalization time.
