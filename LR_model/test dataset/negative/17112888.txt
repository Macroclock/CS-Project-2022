Low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are associated with vascular remodeling in cardiac transplant recipients. Early atherosclerosis may be associated with compensatory vessel enlargement, termed positive remodeling. Enlarged brachial artery diameter has been reported in patients with risk factors for atherosclerosis and in individuals with coronary atherosclerosis, indicating that brachial artery enlargement is a marker for the presence of atherosclerotic changes. Cardiac transplant recipients often have abnormal lipid levels, but the effect of specific lipid abnormalities on vascular remodeling in this population has not been evaluated. This study examined the relationship between lipid levels and brachial artery diameter in cardiac transplant recipients. Thirty-five stable cardiac transplant recipients underwent high-resolution brachial artery ultrasound to evaluate resting brachial artery diameter. Levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides were determined and the presence of other cardiac risk factors was assessed. Brachial artery diameter was larger (4.3 +/- 0.1 mm) in subjects with low levels of HDL-C (< 40 mg/dL, n = 11) compared to subjects with high HDL-C (> or = 40 mg/dL, n = 24), who had a mean brachial artery diameter of 3.7 +/- 0.1 mm (P = .006). Neither high LDL-C (> or = 100 mg/dL) nor high triglycerides (> or = 200 mg/dL) were associated with differences in brachial artery diameter. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the relationship between low HDL-C and increased brachial artery diameter was independent of body surface area or statin use. Low levels of HDL-C are an independent predictor of brachial artery enlargement in stable cardiac transplant recipients. These findings suggest that suboptimal HDL-C levels may be associated with the development of vascular remodeling and atherosclerosis in this population.
