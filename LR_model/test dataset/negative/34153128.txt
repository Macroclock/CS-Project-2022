Prognostic value of cardiopulmonary exercise test after heart transplantation. The clinical utility of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) has not been extensively studied yet in heart transplantation (HTX) patients. To analyze the predictive value of the CPET on hospitalizations and mortality in HTX recipients. A retrospective cohort was performed from a secondary database. Patients > 18 years with HTX who underwent a CPET between 3 and 12 months after transplantation were included. Time to the first primary endpoint (HTX-related hospitalization) was analyzed and adjusted using Cox proportional hazards regression model. A total of 122 patients (mean age 50.1 years, 77.0% men) were included. Fifty-seven patients (46.7%) had the primary endpoint. Peak VO In HTX recipients, peak VO 'Cardiopulmonary exercise testing', 'heart transplantation', 'oxygen consumption', 'oxygen pulse', 'predicted oxygen consumption'
