The role of TNF-related activation-induced cytokine-receptor activating NF-kappa B interaction in acute allograft rejection and CD40L-independent chronic allograft rejection. We analyzed the role of TNF-related activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE), a member of the TNF family expressed on activated T cells that shares functional properties with CD40L, and its receptor-activating NF-kappaB (RANK) which is mostly expressed on mature dendritic cells, during allogenic responses in vivo using a rodent heart allograft model. TRANCE mRNA was strongly up-regulated in acutely rejected allografts on days 4 and 5 posttransplantation whereas RANK was detected as early as day 1 but did not show further up-regulation during the first week. Immunofluoresence analyses of heart allografts showed that 80 and 100% of TRANCE and RANK-expressing cells were T cells and APCs, respectively. We show for the first time that short-term TRANCE blockade using a mouse RANKIg fusion molecule can significantly prolong heart allograft survival in both rat and mouse models. Similarly, rat heart allografts transduced with a RANKIg encoding recombinant adenovirus exhibited a significant prolongation of survival (14.3 vs 7.6 days, p < 0.0001). However, TRANCE blockade using RANKIg did not appear to inhibit allogeneic T and B cell priming humoral responses against RANKIg. Interestingly, TRANCE blockade induced strong up-regulation of CD40 ligand (CD40L) mRNA in allografts. Combined CD40L and TRANCE blockade resulted in significantly decreased chronic allograft rejection lesions as well as allogeneic humoral responses compared with CD40L blockade alone. We conclude that TRANCE-RANK interactions play an important role during acute allograft rejection and that CD40L-independent allogeneic immune responses can be, at least in part, dependent on the TRANCE pathway of costimulation.
