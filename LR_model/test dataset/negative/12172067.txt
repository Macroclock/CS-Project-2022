Effects of an enhanced heart rate reserve on aerobic performance in patients with a heart transplant. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a high-intensity warm-up at the start of a graded, symptom-limited exercise test would enhance heart rate reserve and thus improve the aerobic performance of orthotopic heart transplant patients. Adrenal and cardiorespiratory responses were compared in 10 orthotopic heart transplant patients who performed two graded, symptom-limited exercise tests on an ergocycle. At the start of the graded, symptom-limited exercise test, high intensity increased the norepinephrine level more than usual intensity between rest and the third minute of exercise. This higher norepinephrine level was followed by a higher heart rate response from the fourth minute of exercise. Heart rate reserve was enhanced during high-intensity exercise, without any significant change in peak oxygen uptake. This specific warm-up enhanced heart rate reserve during a graded, symptom-limited exercise test on an ergocycle. Mechanisms more important than limited heart rate reserve are involved in the limitation of exercise tolerance in orthotopic heart transplant patients.
