Apoptotic cell death during accelerated rejection in sensitized rat recipients of cardiac allografts. Accelerated rejection due to host sensitization to major histocompatibility complex antigens is a critical problem in clinical organ transplantation in patients who have previously received an organ transplant, experienced acute rejection episodes, received blood transfusions, or been pregnant. The precise pathologic mechanisms underlying accelerated rejection have not been characterized. Herein, we describe apoptosis during T- and B-cell-driven accelerated rejection of cardiac allografts in presensitized recipients. In an established accelerated rejection model, Lewis rats were sensitized to skin grafts from Wistar-Furth rats; after 7 days, they received Wistar-Furth hearts. These grafts were rejected within 24 hours posttransplantation compared with 10 days in nonsensitized recipients (acute rejection, n = 5). Apoptosis was observed during accelerated rejection of cardiac allografts but not in na√Øve recipients of hearts, as demonstrated at DNA laddering and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling) assay. Apoptosis was discovered as a thus far unknown effector mechanism in accelerated cardiac transplant rejection that accompanies combined cellular and humoral immune alloreactivity. Apoptotic cell death in accelerated rejection and the cascade of upstream and downstream events leading to or resulting from this process should be considered critical steps in the pathogenesis of accelerated rejection.
