Cardiac transplantation: any role left? The authors analyze the question of whether heart transplantation still has a role in the current era of complex technologies. To achieve this objective, the authors first discuss the known benefits of different therapeutic modalities currently available for patients who have end-stage heart failure, including pharmacologic management, electrophysiologic therapies, high-risk surgical strategies, implantation of mechanical circulatory support device therapy, and heart transplantation. The authors then evaluate the current developments and future perspectives in the field that may influence the likelihood of heart transplantation to remain the therapeutic modality of choice for end-stage heart failure.
