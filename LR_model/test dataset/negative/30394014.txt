Preponderance of microbial isolates among heart transplantation recipients requiring renal replacement therapy: a propensity score-adjusted analysis. To assess the association between renal replacement therapy (RRT) and post-transplant infection incidence. This single-center retrospective cohort study included 158 patients who underwent heart transplantation (HTx) in our center from 2008 to 2016, survived beyond the first post-procedural day, and had available microbial data. The patients were dichotomized according to the need for periprocedural RRT. Twenty-seven patients in RRT group had lower preoperative creatinine clearance, greater body mass index, and higher likelihood of having diabetes. Propensity score adjustment was used to account for multiple covariates. The primary outcome measure was the presence of bacteremia in patients with and without the need for RRT. The secondary outcome measures were the presence of microbial isolates from any culture and clinical outcome data. Unadjusted analysis showed that the RRT group had higher incidence of any positive microbial isolate (93% vs 73%; odds ratio [OR] 4.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-30.53; P=0.026) and an increased susceptibility to bacteremia (50% vs 22%; OR 3.50, 95% CI 1.28-9.67; P=0.012). Propensity score-adjusted analysis corroborated the between-group difference in positive blood cultures (OR 3.97, 95% CI 1.28-12.32; P=0.017). There was no difference in the incidence of total microbial isolates between the groups (OR 4.55, 95% CI 0.90-23.05; P=0.067). Patients requiring RRT after HTx had an increased susceptibility to infections via various portals of entry, predominantly due to an increase in blood-borne infections. Understanding the underlying conditions leading to infection-related morbidity is important for infection control and prevention.
