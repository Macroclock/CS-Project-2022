Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary lesions in cardiac transplant vasculopathy: acute and mid-term clinical and angiographic outcomes. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the major cause of graft failure and death in cardiac transplant recipients after transplantation. We aimed to evaluate the clinical and angiographic outcomes of patients with evidence of CAV who were treated percutaneously with drug-eluting stents (DES-PCI). Between December 2002 and September 2005, we reviewed the baseline procedural characteristics and the clinical outcome of consecutive cardiac transplanted recipients with evidence of CAV treated with DES-PCI, eligible for at least 9 months of follow-up. Fifteen consecutive patients received a total of 18 coronary DESs. Total treated lesions were 20; 12 (60%) involved the left anterior descending artery. CAV was focal in nine patients, diffuse in five patients, and mixed in only one patient. Mean time interval from transplantation to DES implantation was 126 +/- 44 months. Angiographic and procedural success was 100%. There were no adverse in-hospital events. During follow-up (17.9 +/- 8.4 months), two patients died of noncardiac cause. Six patients required a new percutaneous intervention for a repeat revascularization rate of 40%: one patient underwent target lesion revascularization because of in-DES restenosis, one patient had target vessel revascularization because of a new coronary lesion proximal to the stent. Finally, four more patients underwent repeat DES-PCI in a coronary vessel other than the treated one. Although DES implantation seems to be associated with a high procedural success rate and a low restenosis rate, the repeat revascularization rate due to CAV progression remains in nearly half of our study patients.
