Aneural culture of rat myoblasts for myocardial transplant. Due to the peculiar characteristics of skeletal muscle, myoblast transplants have emerged as a therapy for cardiomyopathy, particularly after myocardial infarction. The objectives of this study were to define the mean time of cultivation necessary to obtain a cellular concentration of 10(6) to expand the mass for transplant, and to identify the proliferation phase of myoblasts. Ten myoblast cultures were performed using newborn Wistar rats. The isolation method used enzymatic dissociation in culture medium (HAM-F12 and 199) supplement with basic-fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) and insulin growth factor (IGF-I). The mean cultivation time to obtain the desired concentration of 10(6) was 7 days, with expansion of up to 10(8)/g. When b-FGF was used, the cellular yield was approximately 10(7), with IGF-I the cellular yield was approximately 10(8), independent of the medium. We concluded that IGF-I is the better option for mass cellular expansion of myoblasts for application in myocardial transplants.
