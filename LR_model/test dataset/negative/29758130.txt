Pediatric heart transplantation at adult-specialty centers in the United States: A multicenter registry analysis. Recent Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network bylaw revisions mandate that US transplant programs have an "approved pediatric component" in order to perform heart transplantation (HT) in patients <18 years old. The impact of this change on adolescents, a group known to be at high risk for graft loss and nonadherence, is unknown. We studied all US primary pediatric (age <18 years) HT from 2000 to 2015 to compare graft survival between centers organized mainly for adult versus pediatric care. Centers were designated as pediatric- or adult-specialty care according to the ratio of pediatric:adult HT performed and minimum age of HT (pediatric-specialty defined as ratio>0.7; adult-specialty ratio<0.05 and minimum age >8 years). In propensity score-matched cohorts, we observed no difference in graft loss by center type (median survival: adult 12.4 years vs pediatric 9.2 years, P = .174). Compared to the matched pediatric cohort, adult-specialty center recipients lived closer to their transplant center (31 vs 45 miles, P = .012), and trended toward fewer out-of-state transplants (15 vs 25%, P = .082). Our data suggest that select adolescents can achieve similar midterm graft survival at centers organized primarily for adult HT care. Regardless of post-HT setting, the development of care models that demonstrably improve adherence may be of greatest benefit to improving survival of this high-risk population.
