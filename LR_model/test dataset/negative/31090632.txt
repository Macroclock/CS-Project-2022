The meaning of donor-specific antibodies after heart transplant. Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is a major contributor of impaired long-term survival after heart transplantation (HTx). The presence of circulating donor-specific antihuman leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies (DSAs) is considered as a mandatory criterion for AMR after HTx. DSA are known prognostic biomarkers of outcome, for example, recipients with de-novo DSA have a three-fold increased risk of mortality. Although the awareness of the impact and prognosis of DSA on the survival has been increased in the HTx community over the last decade, the management of DSA pre and posttransplant varies among centers and is mainly based on the experience of transplant physicians. Thus, firm consensus strategies for each HTx recipient should be established by a center advisory board of experts in the field of HLA genetics, transplantation immunology, and HTx to evaluate the immunological risk preoperatively and also continuously during the posttransplant course. Consequently, the recent advances of invasive and noninvasive diagnostic tools should be applied, according to the risk, laboratory findings, and clinical events of the recipient. Such individual strategy will result in tailored therapeutic options. Novel standards for the management of DSA in HTx recipients on the basis of an interdisciplinary approach of experts will improve diagnostics for personalized medicine.
