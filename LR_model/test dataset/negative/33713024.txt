Cardiovascular Drug Therapy during Interstage After Hybrid Approach: A Single-Center Experience in 51 Newborns with Hypoplastic Left Heart. Newborns with hypoplastic left heart (HLH) are usually palliated with the Norwood procedure or a hybrid stage I procedure. Hybrid is our preferred approach. Given the critical relationship between stage I, interstage, and comprehensive stage II or advanced biventricular repair, we hypothesized that appropriate drug treatment is a significant therapeutic cornerstone, especially for the management of the high-risk interstage. We report a single-center observational study addressing the cardiovascular effects of, in particular, oral β-blockers and the additional use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and mineralocorticoid inhibitors. In total, 51 newborns-30 with HLH syndrome (HLHS) and 21 with HLH complex (HLHC)-with a median bodyweight of 3.0 kg (range 1.9-4.4; nine with bodyweight ≤ 2500 g) underwent an uneventful "Giessen hybrid approach" using a newly approved duct stent. All patients were discharged home with a single, double or triple therapy consisting of ß-blockers, ACE and mineralocorticoid inhibitors; 90% of the patients received bisoprolol, 10% received propranolol, 72% received lisinopril, and 78% received spironolactone. Resting heart rate decreased from 138 bpm (range 112-172; n = 51) at admission to 123 bpm (range 99-139; n = 51) at discharge and 110 bpm before stage II/biventricular repair/heart transplantation (range 90-140; n = 37) accompanied by favorable bodyweight gain. No side effects were evident. In view of drug risk/benefit profiles, as well as the variable morphology and hemodynamics, the highly selective β1-adrenoceptor blocker bisoprolol is our preferred drug for treatment of HLHS/HLHC in the interstage. We avoid using ACE inhibitor monotherapy and exclude potential risks for coronary and cerebral perfusion pressure beforehand.
