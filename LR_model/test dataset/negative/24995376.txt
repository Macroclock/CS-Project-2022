Echocardiography detects elevated left ventricular filling pressures in heart transplant recipients. Diastolic dysfunction is a recognized complication in heart transplant (HTx) recipients that limits exercise capacity and is a risk factor for mortality. We investigated the ability of echocardiography to detect elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (mean PCWP>15 mmHg) in HTx recipients. This retrospective study comprised HTx recipients with echocardiography and right heart catheterization within 24 hours (n = 100, 113 investigations). Echocardiographic assessment was performed using mitral inflow (E/A ratio, deceleration time [DT], isovolumic relaxation time [IVRT]), tissue Doppler (E/E' lateral) parameters, and the Doppler-estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (Doppler PASP). The right atrial pressure (RAP) was estimated based on size and the effect of respiration or sniffing on the inferior vena cava diameter. Cutoff values were determined from a derivation group (n = 57, receiver operator characteristic curve analysis) and evaluated in a test group (n = 56). Elevated PCWP were found in 38%. The RAP and PCWP were both normal in 58 investigations and elevated in 39 investigations (concordance rate of 86.6%). The presence of signs of increased RAP by echocardiography or with three of five parameters (E/A, DT, IVRT, E/E' lateral, and Doppler PASP) reaching the cutoff values ruled in elevated PCWP with positive likelihood ratios ranging from 15.3 to 9. With normal RAP by echocardiography or none of the other parameters reaching cutoff values elevated PCWP can be ruled out with negative likelihood ratios ranging from 0.07 to 0.19. In conclusion, elevated PCWP in HTx recipients can be assessed using echocardiography. 'diastolic dysfunction', 'echocardiography', 'heart transplant recipient'
