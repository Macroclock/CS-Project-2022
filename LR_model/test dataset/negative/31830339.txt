Hepatitis C donor viremic cardiac transplantation: A practical approach. Patients with end-stage heart failure eligible for orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) exceed the number of available donor organs. With highly effective hepatitis C virus (HCV) antiviral therapy now available, HCV+ organs are increasingly utilized. We seek to describe our experience with patients receiving HCV viremic organs as compared to non-HCV transplant recipients. Our center began utilizing HCV hearts in February 2018. We retrospectively reviewed baseline demographics, laboratory data and outcomes for those undergoing OHT with majority being from a viremic HCV donor. Twenty-three of 25 HCV recipients received hearts from NAT+ donors with 22 of 23 seroconverting within 7 days. Fifteen recipients have completed HCV treatment, with the longest duration of follow-up being 13 months. No differences in rates of rejection, hospitalizations or death were seen between non-HCV and HCV transplant patients. With the advent of available direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), viremic HCV hearts provide an opportunity to increase organ availability. Moreover, treatment for HCV in the setting of immunosuppression is well-tolerated and results in sustained viremic response. Viremic, discordant HCV OHT can be performed in a safe and effective manner utilizing a systematic, multidisciplinary approach without an effect on short-term outcomes.
