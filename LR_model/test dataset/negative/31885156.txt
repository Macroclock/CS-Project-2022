Motor outcome, executive functioning, and health-related quality of life of children, adolescents, and young adults after ventricular assist device and heart transplantation. The aim of the current study is to measure long-term executive function, motor outcome, and QoL in children, adolescents, and young adults after VAD and Htx. Patients were examined during routine follow-up. Investigation tools were used as follows: Examination for MND of motor outcomes, Epitrack Out of 145 heart transplant recipients at the department of pediatric cardiology of the University Hospital Munich, 39 were implanted with a VAD between 1992 and 2016. Seventeen (43.6%) patients died before or after Htx; 22 (56.4%) patients were included in our study. Mean age at transplant was 9.52 years (range: 0.58-24.39 years, median 9), and the mean follow-up time after Htx was 6.18 years (range: 0.05-14.60 years, median 5.82). MND examination could be performed in 13 patients (normal MND: n = 11, simple MND: n = 1, complex MND: n = 1). Executive functioning was tested in 15 patients. Two (13.3%) patients had good results, six (40%) average results, three (20%) borderline results, and four (26.7%) impaired results. QoL (Kidscreen n = 7, EQ-5D-5L n = 8) was similar to a healthy German population. Motor outcome, executive functioning and QoL in survivors of VAD bridging therapy and Htx can be good, though underlying diseases and therapies are associated with a high risk of cerebral ischemic or hemorrhagic complications.
