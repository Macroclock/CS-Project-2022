Comprehensive Analysis of Cardiac Xeno-Graft Unveils Rejection Mechanisms. Porcine heart xenotransplantation is a potential treatment for patients with end-stage heart failure. To understand molecular mechanisms of graft rejection after heart transplantation, we transplanted a 31-day-old  'Xenotransplatation', 'heart failure', 'porcine cardiac tissue', 'transcriptome analysis (or RNA-seq analysis)'
