[Noninvasive diagnosis of acute cellular rejection of transplanted heart]. Endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard of diagnosis of acute cellular rejection after heart transplantation. However, routine biopsies are of major inconvenience to patients and are also risky and costly. In the present research we considered possibility of non-invasive diagnosis of acute cellular rejection in patients after orthotopic heart transplantation. Results of research are based on studying 34 endomyocardial biopsys in combination with Holter monitoring and ECHO findings in 21 heart recipients. It is demonstrated that case follow-up with Holter monitoring and ECHO is mandatory for diagnosis of acute cellular rejection and optimal treatment tactics.
