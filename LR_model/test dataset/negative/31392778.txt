Translation, adaptation, and reliability of the Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplantation in the Spanish population. Psychosocial risk factors influence the course of transplantation. Psychosocial evaluation is an important part of pre-transplantation evaluation processes, yet there are no standardized instruments in Spanish. To translate, adapt, and test the reliability of the Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplantation (SIPAT) in organ and cell transplantation patients in the Spanish context. A Spanish version was developed and adapted using WHO's guidelines. The first 30 candidates' SIPAT interviews were recorded and scored by four independent examiners to test the inter-rater reliability. The internal consistency of the SIPAT items was calculated with a sample of 150 heart, liver, and allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant candidates. Evaluations were conducted by SIPAT-trained and transplantation-experienced clinical psychologists and psychiatrists. Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplantation achieved excellent intra-class correlation reliability coefficients between investigators (ICC = 0.93 for the general score and from 0.77 to 0.94 for domain scores). Good internal consistency was found with Cronbach's alpha of 0.84 (from 0.69-0.71 for domains). This study presents the translated and adapted version of SIPAT. It has been found to have strong inter-rater reliability and good internal consistency. Further research is needed to confirm reliability (eg, test-retest) and establish its validity (eg, concurrent, predictive). 'assessment', 'psychosocial', 'transplant'
