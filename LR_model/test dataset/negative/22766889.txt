Osteoporosis after solid organ transplantation. Osteoporosis and high risk of fractures have emerged as frequent and devastating complications of organ solid transplantation process. Bone loss after organ transplant is related to adverse effects of immunosuppressive drugs on bone remodeling and bone quality. Many factors contribute to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in transplanted patients. This review address the mechanisms of bone loss that occurs both in the early and late post-transplant periods including the contribution of the immunosuppressive agents as well as the specific features to bone loss after kidney, lung, liver and cardiac transplantation. Therapy for bone loss and prevention of fragility fracture in the transplant recipient will also be discussed.
