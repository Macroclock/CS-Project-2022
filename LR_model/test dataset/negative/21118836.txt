Flash pulmonary edema in an orthotopic heart transplant recipient. Flash pulmonary edema (FPE) is a severe renovascular disease that leads to acute recurring pulmonary edema and acute systemic hypertension. Though rarely reported in the literature, its incidence is probably underestimated secondary to misdiagnosis, especially in patients with normal left ventricular function. We report the case of an orthotopic heart transplant recipient who presented with FPE despite having normal left ventricular function and no signs or symptoms of transplant rejection. Discovery of severe bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in this patient led to emergency hepatorenal bypass surgery and a favorable postoperative course.
