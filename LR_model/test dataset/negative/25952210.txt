Mitraclip procedure as a bridge therapy in a patient with heart failure listed for heart transplantation. Functional mitral regurgitation (MR) is frequently detected in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and advanced heart failure, worsening quality of life and predicting poor survival. However, the optimal treatment of patients with advanced heart failure and severe MR has been controversial. We present the case of a 55-year-old man with previous aortic valve replacement, severe MR with high-grade pulmonary hypertension, and refractory heart failure (HF). He was listed for cardiac transplant and underwent percutaneous MitraClip implantation as bridge therapy. The postoperative course was uneventful, with significant improvement in New York Heart Association functional class. The patient underwent a successful heart transplant 8 months after the procedure.
