Cross-sectional psychosocial evaluation of heart transplantation candidates. Heart transplantation (HT) is a potentially life-saving procedure for people with terminal cardiac disease. In the last decades researchers of HT programs have attempted to identify the existence of psychosocial factors that might influence the clinical outcome before and after the transplantation. The main objective of this study was to describe epidemiological, psychiatric and psychological features of a large sample of HT candidates. Cross-sectional, observational and descriptive study. A psychiatric and psychological assessment of 125 adult patients was performed at the moment of being included in the HT waiting list, between 2006 and 2012. The assessment consisted in: Clinical, epidemiological and psychosocial form; Spanish version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV axis I disorders; Coping questionnaire (COPE); Five Factors Inventory Revised (NEO-FFI-R); Apgar-Family questionnaire and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control scale. Axis I diagnoses were present in a 30.4% of patients. COPE showed that this group of patients used most frequently engagement strategies. Personality factors profile of NEO-FFI-R were similar to general population and locus of control scale also presented similar scores compared with other chronic diagnostic groups. Statistically significant associations were found between personality factors and COPE scales/dimensions and psychopathology, mainly neuroticism and disengagement. This is the first study to assess systematically psychosocial factors in a large sample of HT candidates. We have found that around one third of these patients have a psychiatric disorder. Neuroticism and disengagement coping styles can serve as markers of emotional distress. 'Coping', 'Heart transplantation', 'Personality', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial'
