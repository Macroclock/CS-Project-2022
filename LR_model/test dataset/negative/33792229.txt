Exertional and nocturnal periodic breathing after successful cardiac transplantation. A case report. We present a case report of a heart failure patient who underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing and sleep screening 12 months before and after heart transplantation (HTx). Severe Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) with central sleep apnoea (CSA) was identified either before and after HTx, while periodic breathing during exercise vanished. We suggest that optimization of hemodynamics and medical therapy (low dose of diuretic) did not withdraw the central mechanisms underlying the diathesis for CSR-CSA. While periodic breathing during exercise reversal may support a closer link with an exertional central hemodynamic. This observation indirectly neglects the possible unifying mechanistic background of CSR and periodic breathing, during exercise, in this setting.
