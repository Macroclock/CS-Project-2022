Clinical echocardiographic indices of left ventricular diastolic function correlate poorly with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at 1 year following heart transplantation. Clinical echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function is routinely performed following orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). The purpose of this study was to determine whether echocardiographic indices of LV diastolic function correlate with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) in the transplanted heart. Patients who had OHT between June 2009 and November 2011 underwent transthoracic echocardiography and right heart catheterization (RHC) at approximately 1 year post transplantation. We retrospectively assessed 33 potential parameters of LV diastolic function using 2-dimensional, spectral Doppler and tissue Doppler echocardiography. We measured PCWP by RHC. We compared echocardiographic measures with PCWP using linear regression analysis. Ninety-five patients (mean age 49 ± 13 years, 73 males, mean LV ejection fraction 62 ± 10%) were included in the study. Overall, echocardiographic parameters of LV diastolic function demonstrated poor correlation with PCWP. By linear regression, the parameter that most strongly correlated with PCWP was left atrial (LA) minimum area in the apical 4-chamber view (p = 0.002, r(2) = 0.1). Comparing patients with PCWP ≤ 12 mmHg and those with PCWP > 12 mmHg, the parameter that demonstrated the most significant difference was LA minimum area in the apical 2-chamber view (p = 0.002), and comparing patients with PCWP ≤ 15 mmHg and those with PCWP > 15 mmHg, the most significant difference was peak early diastolic velocity of the mitral annulus (p = 0.02). In patients with cardiac allografts, clinical echocardiographic measures of LV diastolic function correlate poorly with PCWP.
