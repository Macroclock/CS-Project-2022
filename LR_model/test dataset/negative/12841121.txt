[Heart transplantation in children]. Heart transplantation represents the only effective method of treatment of intractable heart diseases. Cardiomyopathy with heart dilation, inoperable congenital heart diseases and heart failure after the heart surgery represent the most common indications for heart transplantation in pediatrics. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is the most frequent indication for the heart transplantation in neonates and infants. In infants steroids-free immunosuppression is used or steroids are withdrawn 6 to 12 months after the transplantation. Graft failure, acute rejection and infection are the most common causes of death after transplantation. Long-term results and the quality of life depend on the occurrence of rejection, infection, graft vasculopathy, lymphoproliferative disease and side effects of immunosuppression. Posttransplant graft vasculopathy, however, represents the most dangerous late complication, which requires retransplantation. Improvement of the transplantation program improves the survival rate as well as the quality of life after transplantation. Survival after heart transplantation is 80% in one year and 50% in ten years interval. Better results can be achieved in neonates. Lack of donors, demanding economical and organisational conditions and the unresolved legislation problems preclude wider use of heart transplantation in children. Research for more effective, safer and cheaper pharmacotherapy in the prevention and treatment of rejection, infection and complications of immunosuppression is required. Long-term effects and the quality of life after heart transplantation in children, as well as possibilities of mechanical heart support and xenotransplantation must be also studied.
