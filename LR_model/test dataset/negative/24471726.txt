A rare ocular complication after a heart transplant: toxoplasma retinitis. Ocular infections after a heart transplant are rare; but when present, they generally appear during the first year after surgery. Ocular infections may cause significant loss of vision and morbidity if not diagnosed early. For that reason, heart transplant patients should undergo a routine visual examination during follow-up. We report our experience regarding the followup and treatment of a case of toxoplasma retinitis diagnosed in one of our heart transplant recipients.
