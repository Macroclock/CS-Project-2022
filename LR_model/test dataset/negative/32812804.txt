De Novo Damaging Variants, Clinical Phenotypes, and Post-Operative Outcomes in Congenital Heart Disease. De novo genic and copy number variants are enriched in patients with congenital heart disease, particularly those with extra-cardiac anomalies. The impact of de novo damaging variants on outcomes following cardiac repair is unknown. We studied 2517 patients with congenital heart disease who had undergone whole-exome sequencing as part of the CHD GENES study (Congenital Heart Disease Genetic Network). Two hundred ninety-four patients (11.7%) had clinically significant de novo variants. Patients with de novo damaging variants were 2.4 times more likely to have extra-cardiac anomalies ( In patients with congenital heart disease undergoing open-heart surgery, de novo variants were associated with worse transplant-free survival and longer times on the ventilator. De novo variants were most strongly associated with adverse outcomes among patients without extra-cardiac anomalies, suggesting a benefit for preoperative genetic testing even when genetic abnormalities are not suspected during routine clinical practice.
