PCSK9 Inhibitors in Heart Transplant Patients: Safety, Efficacy, and Angiographic Correlates. Statins are recommended in heart transplant patients, but are sometimes poorly tolerated. Alternative agents are often considered including proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 inhibitors (PCSK9i). We sought to investigate the use of PCSK9i after heart transplantation. We identified patients who received a heart transplant from 1999 to 2019 and were started on PCSK9i at our institution. Clinical, laboratory, and coronary angiography with intravascular ultrasound results were compared. Among 65 patients initiated on PCSK9i (48 for statin intolerance and 17 for refractory hyperlipidemia), the median time from transplant was 5.5 years (interquartile range [IQR], 2.8-9.9 years) with a median PCSK9 treatment duration of 1.6 years (IQR, 0.8-3.2 years) and 80% still on treatment. Evolocumab was used in 73.8%, alirocumab in 12.3%, and both in 13.8% owing to insurance coverage. All patients required prior authorization; initial denial occurred in 18.5% and 32.3% had denials in subsequent years. The median low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased from 130 mg/dL (IQR, 102-148 mg/dL) to 55 mg/dL (IQR, 35-74 mg/dL) after starting PCSK9i (P < .001), with 72% of patients achieving a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of <70 mg/dL after treatment. There were also significant reductions of total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, and triglycerides, with a modest increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. These changes were durable at latest follow-up. In 33 patients with serial coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound, PCSK9i were associated with stable coronary plaque thickness and lumen area. Among heart transplant recipients, PCSK9i are effective in lowering cholesterol levels and stabilizing coronary intimal hyperplasia with minimal side effects. Despite favorable effects, access and affordability remain a challenge. 'IVUS', 'LDL', 'PCSK9 inhibitors', 'heart transplant', 'hyperlipidemia', 'insurance', 'prior authorizations'
