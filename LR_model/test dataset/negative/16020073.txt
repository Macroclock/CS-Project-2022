Somebody else's heart inside me: a descriptive study of psychological problems after a heart transplantation. This study describes the psychological problems of heart transplant recipients. Using a qualitative research approach, interviews were conducted with 42 patients(35 men and 7 women). Analysis of the data revealed concerns about the donor's heart and how receiving somebody else's heart might affect the recipient's own personality; feelings of guilt for the donor's death and feelings of gratitude towards the donor's family; and concerns about the recipient's own heart. These findings provide health care professionals with pointers that may aid improved information provision and maximise the use of existing coping strategies.
