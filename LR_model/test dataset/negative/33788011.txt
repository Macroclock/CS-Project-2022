Longest reported support (7.5Â years) with postauricular type of Jarvik 2000 axial-flow left ventricular assist device. Mechanical circulatory supports with left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) are nowadays an established treatment in end-stage heart failure for those patients who are waiting for an organ donation or are unsuitable for transplantation. The duration of LVAD support is variable, depending on the device, the intention to treat and the issues occurring during treatment, which can change the purpose treatment or accelerate the transplantation. Moreover, length of reported supports in the literature is heterogenous. In here, we present the clinical and surgical case of the longest LVAD support reported in the literature, as a bridge to transplantation, with axial pump Jarvik 2000 (Jarvik Heart, Inc, New York, NY).
