Sinus node dysfunction masquerading as complete atrioventricular block in the setting of atrial parasystole after heart transplantation. Heart transplantation is the gold standard for treatment of end stage heart failure. Atrial parasystole (AP), defined as the presence of an additional dissociated atrial pacemaker on a surface electrocardiogram, has been described to be seen after heart transplantation using biatrial surgical technique. AP may pose a challenge in diagnosing underlying rhythm disturbances in these patients. Here, we report a rare phenomenon of junctional escape rhythm with sinus node dysfunction, mimicking as complete atrioventricular block due to the presence of an AP, in a heart transplant recipient.
