Olaparib protects cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress and improves graft contractility during the early phase after heart transplantation in rats. Olaparib, rucaparib and niraparib, potent inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) are approved as anti-cancer drugs in humans. Considering the previously demonstrated role of PARP in various forms of acute and chronic myocardial injury, we tested the effects of olaparib in in-vitro models of oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes, and in an in vivo model of cardiac transplantation. H9c2-embryonic rat heart-derived myoblasts pretreated with vehicle or olaparib (10Î¼M) were challenged with either hydrogen peroxide (H Olaparib blocked autoPARylation of PARP1 and attenuated the rapid onset of death in H9c2 cells, induced by H Olaparib protected cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress and improved graft contractility in a rat model of heart transplantation. These findings raise the possibility of repurposing this clinically approved oncology drug, to be used in heart transplantation.
