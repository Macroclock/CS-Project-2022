Effect of confounding factors on a phospho-flow assay of ribosomal S6 protein for therapeutic drug monitoring of the mTOR-inhibitor everolimus in heart transplanted patients. Several assays of monitoring immune cell function have been developed to enhance therapeutic drug monitoring. An in vitro-validated whole-blood assay of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (pS6RP) was evaluated for confounders to monitor the mTOR-inhibitor everolimus (ERL). Whole blood samples from 87 heart transplant recipients were analyzed for pS6RP-expression in CD3-positive T-cells by phospho-flow analysis. ERL blood concentration, laboratory parameters, co-medications, demographic and clinical data were reviewed. Evaluating the pS6RP-assay revealed that pS6RP is influenced by cyclosporine A (CsA) blood concentration, duration of ERL treatment, co-medication with thiazide diuretics and different metabolic parameters.
