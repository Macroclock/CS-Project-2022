Differential inflammatory responses of the native left and right ventricle associated with donor heart preservation. Dysfunction and inflammation of hearts subjected to cold ischemic preservation may differ between left and right ventricles, suggesting distinct strategies for amelioration. Explanted murine hearts subjected to cold ischemia for 0, 4, or 8 h in preservation solution were assessed for function during 60 min of warm perfusion and then analyzed for cell death and inflammation by immunohistochemistry and western blotting and total RNA sequencing. Increased cold ischemic times led to greater left ventricle (LV) dysfunction compared to right ventricle (RV). The LV experienced greater cell death assessed by TUNEL Mouse hearts subjected to cold ischemia showed time-dependent contractile dysfunction and increased cell death, inflammatory cytokine expression and inflammasome expression that are greater in the LV than RV. However, IL-6 protein elevations and altered transcriptional profiles were similar in both ventricles. Similar changes are observed in human hearts.
