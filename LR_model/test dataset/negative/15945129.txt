[A 54-year old man with severe circulatory collapse]. The frequent use of mechanical circulatory assistive devices in the treatment of patients in cardiogenic shock increases the need for advanced air and ground transport services.

Close cooperation between the university hospital, the Norwegian Air Ambulance and the Norwegian aviation authorities has facilitated this service.
