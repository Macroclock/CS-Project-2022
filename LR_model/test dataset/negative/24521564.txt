Quality of life following paediatric heart transplant: are age and activity level factors? We evaluated whether quality of life correlates to age and activity in children following heart transplantation. In addition, quality of life in children following heart transplantation was compared with previously reported values in children with congenital heart disease. Quality of life remains an important aspect of therapy. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Generic Core Scales and Cardiac Module were administered to 14 children who had previously undergone heart transplantation. Patients wore a pedometer for 7 days to assess daily activity. The age at assessment was 13.1±1.9 years. The patients were 7.1±5.7 years post heart transplantation. There was a negative correlation between age at first heart transplantation and emotional (r=-0.64; p<0.05) and school function (r=-0.57; p<0.05). A negative correlation between patient's age at assessment and perceived physical appearance existed (r=-0.53; p<0.05). Daily steps negatively correlated with cognitive (r=-0.58; p<0.05), physical (r=-0.63; p<0.05), emotional (r=-0.62; p<0.05), and school function (r=-0.66; p<0.01). Heart transplantation patients reported better scores for treatment and symptoms (p<0.05) but lower physical health scores (p<0.01) than those with moderate congenital heart disease. Paediatric heart transplantation patients reported overall similar quality of life as patients with moderate congenital heart disease. Children receiving heart transplants at an older age may require additional emotional and educational support. Heart transplantation patients with higher activity levels may be more aware of their physical, emotional, and cognitive limitations, and thus score lower on these quality of life indicators.
