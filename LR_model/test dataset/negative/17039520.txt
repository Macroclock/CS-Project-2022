Initial transcatheter palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Initial percutaneous transcatheter palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome is now feasible. The primary procedures for palliation include stenting of the ductus arteriosus with a self expanding nitinol stent to secure an adequate systemic blood flow, placement of an internal pulmonary arterial band to protect the pulmonary vascular bed and to prevent pulmonary overcirculation, and widening of the interatrial communication by blade and balloon septostomy or static balloon dilation to decompress the left atrium. Anatomic variations of the ductus arteriosus have important implications for technical success with ductal stenting. Patients who have undergone complete transcatheter palliation with the internal pulmonary band appear to have less immediate morbidity at the time of transplant, with preserved integrity and growth of the branch pulmonary arteries at one year follow-up.
