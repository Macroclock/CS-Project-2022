HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device as a Bridge-to-Transplant in a Small Boy with Complicated Kawasaki Disease. We report a case of HeartWare ventricular assist device (HVAD) implant as a Bridge-to-Transplant in the smallest and the youngest known patient, a 32-month-old boy (body surface area of 0.66 m2) with known Kawasaki disease and giant coronary artery aneurysms. The disease course was complicated by coronary thromboembolism resulting in acute myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac arrest. After short-term support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 7 days and long-term support with an HVAD for 5 months, he underwent heart transplantation and is doing well 2 months after the transplant.
