Recovery of dilated cardiomyopathies in infants and children using left ventricular assist devices. Most infants and children implanted with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are bridged to cardiac transplantation. Prioritizing recovery may decrease this trend. Patients were treated with LVAD ventricular decompression, medical heart failure therapy, and bolus therapy with a beta-agonist before weaning trials. Devices were removed if adequate function was observed. Eleven patients with a mean age of 1.7 years presented for LVAD implantation. The mean Z score for left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) was +5.5 (+1.6 to +7.3), and the mean fractional shortening was 9% (5%-14%). They were on maximal medical therapy and inotropic support. Duration of device support ranged from 6 to 22 days (mean: 13 days). There were three deaths, one from preimplant anoxic brain damage and two from thromboembolism. Eight patients (73%) recovered, were explanted, and are alive 0.6-6 years with hearts that have a mean Z score for LVEDD of 1.0 (0.09-3.7) and fractional shortening of 23%-36%. Left ventricular assist device decompression of dilated left ventricles in infants and children led to long-term survival in 73%. Ventricular size was significantly reduced and contractility significantly increased. None of these patients required transplantation.
