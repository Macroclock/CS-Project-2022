The incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer and post-transplant lympho-proliferative disorders in the Scottish cardiac transplant population and the provision of specialist dermatological follow-up. Background Immunosuppression helps prevent acute rejection post-cardiac transplant but has been linked to malignancy development. This may be due to a reduction in T-lymphocyte function, a direct oncogenic effect or the increased impact of environmental carcinogens. There has been shown to be significant increases in non-melanoma skin cancers and post-transplant lympho-proliferative disorders, particularly in those treated with OKT3. Aim To investigate the survival and incidence of malignancy in the Scottish cardiac transplant population and whether rates of non-melanoma skin cancers justify the provision of specialist dermatological follow-up. Methods and results Retrospective case note analysis of patients transplanted (363) or followed up (2) in Scotland from 1992 to 2016. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis generated a survival curve. Patients had a 1-year survival of 82% and a median survival of 10.9 years. There were 60 (95% CI 47.5, 75.2) NMSCs and 8 (3.7, 12.4) post-transplant lympho-proliferative disorders diagnosed in the cohort (3110 person years follow-up). Fisher's exact test was employed to analyse the association between induction therapy (via OKT3 or rabbit antithymocyte globulin) and post-transplant lympho-proliferative disorder development. Patients treated with OKT3 had a 6.7 times greater risk ( P = 0.014) and a shorter experience of patients treated with rabbit antithymocyte globulin has so far shown no significantly altered risk ( P = 1.00) of developing a post-transplant lympho-proliferative disorder. Conclusion Incidences of non-melanoma skin cancers and post-transplant lympho-proliferative disorders were increased in the Scottish cardiac transplant population and there was a significant association between post-transplant lympho-proliferative disorder development and OKT3 therapy but not rabbit antithymocyte globulin therapy. These findings in Scottish patients reflect what is published in wider literature and support the provision of a dedicated post-transplant dermatology clinic.
