State of the art: cardiac transplantation. Recent advances in the management of heart transplant recipients have resulted in improved survival, particularly in the early post-transplant period. Although graft rejection, infection, malignancy, and allograft vasculopathy remain important challenges to the long-term management of heart transplant recipients, active research in these fields continues to advance our understanding and improve outcomes. This review will provide an overview of modern heart transplantation, summarize our current understanding of best practices for the management of heart transplant recipients, and describe recent advances in the field and areas of active research.
