Double-Valve Surgery After Cardiac Retransplantation. We provide an update on Canada's first neonatal heart transplant recipient who, after cardiac retransplantation, underwent a mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve repair. Twenty-seven years after his initial heart surgery and 13 years after his most recent transplant, this patient developed heart failure with severe mitral regurgitation secondary to a calcified mitral valve. The patient was highly sensitized with no evidence of allograft rejection; therefore, mitral and tricuspid surgery was performed. The patient did well perioperatively and remains well 18 months after surgery. To our knowledge, this novel case represents the first double-valve surgery in a patient who underwent cardiac retransplantation.
