[Lung transplant]. A lung transplant is usually the final therapeutic option for patients with respiratory insufficiency. In spite of the many advances in immunology and the management of complications, mortality and morbidity associated with this transplant are far higher than with others. Acute rejection is an almost universal problem in the first year, while obliterative bronchitis reduces long term survival. Respiratory infections also play a significant role in the complications associated with lung transplants due to the constant exposure of the graft to the outside. However, the success of this therapeutic option, which basically depends on a suitable selection of donor and recipient, are evident, above all with respect to quality of life.
