Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder following pediatric heart transplantation. Immunosuppression after heart transplantation is implicated in development of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Despite a higher prevalence of PTLD in children, there is scarce knowledge about incidence, pathophysiologic mechanisms and risk factors for PTLD in pediatric recipients of cardiac allografts. We examined retrospectively the medical records of all 143 pediatric patients (mean age 9.2 +/- 6.1 yr) who received donor allografts between 1984 and 2002 and survived over 30 days. Five children (3.5%) developed PTLD over a mean follow-up period of 41.1 +/- 46.0 months. Time from transplant to diagnosis of PTLD ranged from 3.9 to 112 months (mean 48.0 +/- 41.9 months). Excluding PTLD, no other malignancies were found in this population. Actuarial freedom from PTLD was 99.2%, 99.2% and 96.2% at 1, 2, and 5 yr, respectively. Children who developed PTLD were more likely (by univariate analysis) to have been Rh negative (p = 0.01), Rh mismatched (p = 0.003), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) seronegative (p = 0.001) and transplanted for congenital heart disease (p < 0.02). PTLD was associated with significant morbidity and mortality with a mean survival following diagnosis of 21.2 months. PTLD is a serious complicating outcome of cardiac transplantation that occurs in approximately 3.5% of children. Aside of immunosuppression, risk factors in this series for developing PTLD include EBV seronegativity and Rh negative status and mismatch. Non-hematogenous malignancies are rare in light of short allograft half-life.
