Recovery of organ dysfunction during bridging to heart transplantation in children and adolescents. The beneficial effects of ventricular assist devices on organ dysfunction during bridging to heart transplantation have been widely reported in the adult population. In contrast, the use of ventricular assist devices used as bridge-to-transplant in children is limited. To evaluate organ recovery during ventricular support in pediatric transplant candidate, respiratory, renal and hepatic function were reviewed retrospectively. The Thoratec device (stroke volume 65 ml) and the HIA-Medos-system (stroke volume 25/10 ml) were used as bridge-to transplant in 11 children and adolescents who were in low-output-syndrome despite maximal pharmacological support. Prior to implantation five patients were mechanically ventilated, six patients underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation, eight patients had anuria (one treated by hemofiltration), three patients had liver dysfunction and four patients had signs of severe infection. At the time of implantation one patient was supported by the intraaortic balloon pump and one by the femorofemoral bypass for rapid hemodynamic stabilization. Eight patients were treated using the Thoratec device (one of these by Nova cor on the left side), three by the HIA-Medos system. The support time ranged between seven and 140 days. Seven patients could be extubated within three days. Renal function recovered in all pts. Liver enzymes decreased in all pts without reaching normal values. Bilirubin values also decreased in survivors but increased to 9.3 mg/dL in non-survivors. At least seven patients underwent successful heart transplantation, three patients died because of multiorgan failure after extended transfusion and one patient because of technical failure. In our experience the hemodynamic situation was sufficient in all bridging to transplant candidates. In all patients who underwent successful transplantation, transplantability was associated with rapid organ recovery within seven days after initiating mechanical assistance. Extended blood tranfusions, combined failure of three organs and increasing bilirubin values during support seem to be predictors of poor outcome.
