[Hemodynamic Derangements in Patients With Functional Univentricular Heart: Mechanisms of Development, Possibilities of Treatment]. Heart failure (HF) is a predictable outcome of nearly all cardiovascular diseases including congenital heart diseases (CHD). A special category comprises patients with functional single ventricle (FSV) of the heart because of extreme diversity of anatomical changes of the heart and great vessels, complex mechanisms of development of HF, multistage surgical correction of the defect, presence of arrhythmias, progressive rise of pulmonary vascular resistance, etc. Prevention and treatment of HF in patients with FSV includes surgical optimization of pulmonary blood flow during neonatal period, timely staged surgical correction of the defect, pharmacotherapy, cardiac resynchronization therapy, and in severe cases mechanical cardiac support and heart transplantation. This article contains review of the mechanisms of HF development in patients with FSV as well as analysis of current approaches to recognition and treatment of this condition.
