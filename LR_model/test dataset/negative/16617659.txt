Daclizumab in the induction phase of immunosuppression in heart transplant recipients. Acute rejection episodes negatively effect both short-term survival and development of graft vasculopathy. We assessed the incidence and severity of acute rejection episodes under a new protocol using a monoclonal antibody daclizumab in the induction phase of immunosuppressive therapy. The study group B (26 patients) was given daclizumab (1 mg/kg), the control group A (25 patients) was treated without daclizumab. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the important data. A total of first 10 EMB in every patient was classified according to the ISHLT recommendation. We also analysed the incidence of infections. During the first two months there was a significant lower incidence and/or severity of rejection episodes in the daclizumab group with p < or = 0.0016, 0.001 and 0.005 respectively. Induction therapy with daclizumab significantly reduces the incidence of acute rejection episodes during the first two posttransplant months in heart transplant recipients. It does not increase the risk of infection.
