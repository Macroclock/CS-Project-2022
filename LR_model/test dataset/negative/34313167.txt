Burden of arrhythmia and silent ischemia in heart transplant patients with cardiac allograft vasculopathy. The incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) following heart transplantation (HTx) accounts for approximately 10% of post-HTx deaths. Ischemia, brady- and tachy-arrhythmias caused by rejection and cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) seem related to SCD. Hence, we aimed to investigate the relation between CAV, arrhythmias and silent ischemia in long-term HTx patients.
