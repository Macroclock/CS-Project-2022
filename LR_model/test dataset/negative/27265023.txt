Inflammation Causes Resistance to Anti-CD20-Mediated B Cell Depletion. B cells play a central role in antibody-mediated rejection and certain autoimmune diseases. However, B cell-targeted therapy such as anti-CD20 B cell-depleting antibody (aCD20) has yielded mixed results in improving outcomes. In this study, we investigated whether an accelerated B cell reconstitution leading to aCD20 depletion resistance could account for these discrepancies. Using a transplantation model, we found that antigen-independent inflammation, likely through toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, was sufficient to mitigate B cell depletion. Secondary lymphoid organs had a quicker recovery of B cells when compared to peripheral blood. Inflammation altered the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of aCD20 therapy by shortening drug half-life and accelerating the reconstitution of the peripheral B cell pool by bone marrow-derived B cell precursors. IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin) coadministration also shortened aCD20 drug half-life and led to accelerated B cell recovery. Repeated aCD20 dosing restored B cell depletion and delayed allograft rejection, especially B cell-dependent, antibody-independent allograft rejection. These data demonstrate the importance of further clinical studies of the PK/PD of monoclonal antibody treatment in inflammatory conditions. The data also highlight the disconnect between B cell depletion on peripheral blood compared to secondary lymphoid organs, the deleterious effect of IVIG when given with aCD20 and the relevance of redosing of aCD20 for effective B cell depletion in alloimmunity.
