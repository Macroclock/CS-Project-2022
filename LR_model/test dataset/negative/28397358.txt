Depletion-Resistant CD4 T Cells Enhance Thymopoiesis During Lymphopenia. Lymphoablation is routinely used in transplantation, and its success is defined by the balance of pathogenic versus protective T cells within reconstituted repertoire. While homeostatic proliferation and thymopoiesis may both cause T cell recovery during lymphopenia, the relative contributions of these mechanisms remain unclear. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of the thymus during T cell reconstitution in adult allograft recipients subjected to lymphoablative induction therapy. Compared with euthymic mice, thymectomized heart allograft recipients demonstrated severely impaired CD4 and CD8 T cell recovery and prolonged heart allograft survival after lymphoablation with murine anti-thymocyte globulin (mATG). The injection with agonistic anti-CD40 mAb or thymus transplantation only partially restored T cell reconstitution in mATG-treated thymectomized mice. After mATG depletion, residual CD4 T cells migrated into the thymus and enhanced thymopoiesis. Conversely, depletion of CD4 T cells before lymphoablation inhibited thymopoiesis at the stage of CD4 'Immunosuppressant', 'T cell biology', 'basic (laboratory) research/science', 'immunobiology', 'immunosuppression/immune modulation', 'immunosuppressive regimens', 'induction', 'lymphocyte biology', 'polyclonal preparations: rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin', 'thymus/thymic biology'
