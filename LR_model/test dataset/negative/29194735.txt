Paradoxic eczema in infants after heart transplantation. New-onset psoriasis in patients receiving tumor necrosis factor inhibitors is well recognized in children and adults. We describe three children who underwent cardiac transplantation and developed an analogous form of paradoxic eczema occurring 2-48Â months after starting systemic tacrolimus, a drug widely used topically to treat eczema. Anecdotal reports and our experience suggest that tacrolimus taper with alternative systemic antirejection immunosuppressant may lead to skin clearance. Pending additional insight, treatment should include optimizing skin barrier function, minimizing microbial and allergic triggers, and coordinating care to choose the best-tolerated systemic immunosuppressant regimen at the lowest effective dose.
