Indoxyl Sulfate Upregulates Liver P-Glycoprotein Expression and Activity through Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Signaling. In patients with CKD, not only renal but also, nonrenal clearance of drugs is altered. Uremic toxins could modify the expression and/or activity of drug transporters in the liver. We tested whether the uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate (IS), an endogenous ligand of the transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor, could change the expression of the following liver transporters involved in drug clearance:  'ABC transporter', 'chronic kidney disease', 'cyclosporine', 'drug transporter'
