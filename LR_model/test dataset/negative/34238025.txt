Donor Characteristics and Recipient Outcomes After Heart Transplantation in Adult Congenital Heart Disease. Background Patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) experience long waitlist times for heart transplantation (HTx) while a large proportion of donor hearts are refused. The goal of this study was to inform optimal donor selection for patients with ACHD listed for HTx by examining the impact of donor characteristics on post-HTx outcomes. Methods and Results Using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we conducted a retrospective analysis of patients aged ≥18 years listed for HTx in the United States between 2000 and 2016. We compared waitlist times between patients with ACHD and patients with noncongenital heart disease and constructed multivariate hazard models to identify donor characteristics associated with increased waitlist time. We then compared post-HTx survival between patients with ACHD and patients with noncongenital heart disease and constructed multivariate hazard models to identify donor characteristics associated with mortality. There were very few differences in donor characteristics between HTx recipients with ACHD and those with noncongenital heart disease. Status 1A-listed patients with ACHD experienced longer waitlist times compared with patients with noncongenital heart disease. Increased wait times were associated with some donor characteristics. Post-HTx outcomes varied over time, with patients with ACHD having inferior early mortality (0 to 30 days), similar intermediate mortality (31 days to 4 years), and superior late mortality (>4 years). We identified no donor characteristics associated with mortality to justify the observed differences in donor selection or waitlist time. Conclusions HTx candidates with ACHD wait longer for transplant but do not require unique donor selection criteria. HTx teams should consider liberalizing donor criteria and focusing only on evidence-based selection to improve waitlist outcomes and reduce the recipient-donor disparity.
