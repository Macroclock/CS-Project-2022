Repeated immune and non immune insults to the graft after heart transplantation. The clinical transplantation outcome is related to both effects of immunological and non immunological factors degenerating into hyperacute, acute and chronic rejection. Modern immunosuppressive treatments have resolved most events linked to acute rejection while long-term survival still remains the major problem after heart transplantation. The goal of personalized immunosuppressive therapy is to prevent rejection without inducing toxic effects. The aim of future studies could be to clarify the pathogenesis of chronic rejection and develop new and less toxic therapeutic approaches to induce "tolerance" to the graft without major side effects.
