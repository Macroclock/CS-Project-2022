Left Ventricular Assist Devices: A Rapidly Evolving Alternative to Transplant. Left ventricular assist devices are becoming an increasingly prevalent therapy for patients with Stage D heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Quality of life is also improved, although adverse events related to device therapy remain common. Nevertheless, with the continuing organ donor shortage for cardiac transplantation, left ventricular assist devices are frequently serving as a substitute for transplant, particularly in the elderly patient.
