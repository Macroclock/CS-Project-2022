Extracoporeal membrane oxygenation hybrid with Thoratec ventricular-assist devices as double bridge to heart transplantation. Ventricular-assist devices (VADs) have benefitted patients with end-stage heart failure as a bridge to heart transplantation (HTx). Herein, we describe our experience with HTx in the presence of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) together with the Thoratec VAD (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, California). From May 1996 to June 2009, mechanical circulatory support with the Thoratec VAD was provided in 20 patients. Before implantation of the VAD, circulation in 17 patients was maintained using ECMO. Although 350 patients underwent HTx during that period, only 13 patients (65%) received suitable donor organs for orthotopic HTx. The 20 patients ranged in age from 10 to 80 years; 3 were female, and 17 were male; and 17 (85%) required ECMO before VAD implantation. In 11 of 17 patients (65%), the VAD was implanted as a double bridge to HTx. The demand for mechanical circulatory support in patients with acute hemodynamic collapse has led to major improvements in clinically available systems such as ECMO as a double bridge to VAD implantation. We use ECMO as a rescue procedure in patients with acute hemodynamic deterioration. However, during ECMO support, left ventricular afterload increases. If prolonged support is necessary, a VAD may be required. We observed that 65% of patients who received support from an ECMO hybridized with the Thoratec VAD could wait for a suitable donor for HTx. We recommend use of ECMO for short-term support (<1 week) and the Thoratec VAD for medium- or long-term support as a bridge to HTx.
