Outcomes of Adult Heart Transplantation Using Hepatitis C-Positive Donors. Background This study evaluated the impact of hepatitis C-positive (HCV+) donors on outcomes of heart transplantation in the United States. Methods and Results Adults undergoing isolated heart transplantation in the United States between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018, were included. The primary outcome was 1-year post-transplant survival. Multivariable Cox regression and 2:1 propensity matching were used to compare outcomes between transplants with HCV+ and hepatitis C-negative (HCV-) donors. A subanalysis was performed to evaluate the impact of nucleic acid amplification test positivity on outcomes. Of 7889 isolated heart transplants performed during the study period, 343 (4.4%) used HCV+ donors. Overall unadjusted 1-year posttransplant survival was not statistically different between HCV- versus HCV+ donors (91.1% versus 90.2%;  'heart failure', 'heart transplantation', 'hepatitis C', 'rejection'
