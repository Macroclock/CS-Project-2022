A systematic review of psychosocial design considerations for the next generation of mechanical circulatory support. Biomedical engineers are developing new mechanical circulatory support pumps. Clinicians are generating and analysing new evidence for their prescription and management. Industrial designers are generating usable solutions for wearable components and controllers. However, psychosocial considerations may be falling between the cracks of the three disciplines because of their multi-faceted nature. This article seeks to identify psychosocial needs raised in previous work, re-frame them as needs for future products and services, and discuss routes to solutions. SLR extracted 225 statements on psychosocial considerations from 42 included articles. 23 codes were inductively generated and applied to relevant datapoints. Codes were consolidated under 4 main themes and re-framed as solvable problems. Identified themes: expanded remote care, improved multidisciplinary management tools, creating easier interactions; and extending patient engagement. Design-driven methods have been used to solve analogous problems in other contexts and can address the identified psychosocial problems if implemented fully.
