More Hippocampal Weight and Cells in Cardiac Allograft Transplanted Mice. The hippocampus is a brain structure that plays a fundamental role in memory and learning. Many animal studies have demonstrated that the structure of the hippocampus has evolved through exercise and play. However, little is known on the relationship between the brain and immunological reaction. In this study, we investigated the correlation between the weight of the hippocampus and transplant immunology in a murine heart transplant model. Fully vascularized heterotopic hearts from CBA (H2
