Effect of Hepatitis C donor status on heart transplantation outcomes in the United States. Recent studies demonstrated safety and efficacy of heart transplantation (HT) from hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive donors. We sought to evaluate the impact of HCV donor status on the outcomes of patients undergoing HT in the United States. We analyzed a retrospective cohort of adult patients from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database who underwent isolated HT from 2015 until present. Primary outcomes were 30-day and 1-year overall mortality. Secondary outcomes included risk for graft failure and overall survival, incident stroke and need for dialysis during the available follow-up period. All end points were evaluated according to HCV status. All-cause 30-day and 1-year mortality was similar between the two groups (3.4% vs 3.2%, P = .973 and 6.9% vs 7.8%, P = .769, respectively, for patients receiving heart grafts from HCV+ vs. HCV- donors). Graft failure was 12.8% (95% CI: 8%-19%) and 15.2% (95 CI: 15%-16%) in the HCV+ and HCV- groups, respectively (P = .92 and P = .68). Competing risk regression analysis for re-operation showed a non-significant trend for higher risk for re-transplantation in the HCV+ group (HR: 2.71; 95% CI: 0.83, 8.80, P = .097). HCV donor status does not seem to negatively affect the outcomes of HT in the U.S population. 'graft failure', 'heart transplantation', 'hepatitis C'
