Combination of electroporation and DNA/dendrimer complexes enhances gene transfer into murine cardiac transplants. Electroporation is a new gene delivery method to increase gene transfer and expression in vivo. Starburst polyamidoamine dendrimers have been demonstrated to augment gene expression in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesized that the combination of electroporation and dendrimer could enhance the gene transfer and gene expression in cardiac transplants. After immersion in DNA/dendrimer complexes or intracoronary transfer of DNA/dendrimer complexes, both nonvascularized and vascularized syngeneic cardiac grafts, respectively, were subjected to serial electrical pulses before transplantation. beta-Galactosidase reporter gene expression in the graft was determined by X-Gal staining. Gene expression was enhanced 10- to 45-fold in grafts immersed in DNA/dendrimer complexes, or after intracoronary transfer of DNA/dendrimer complexes, and subjected to 20 square wave 25-ms pulses with a strength of 200 V/cm. The combination of electroporation and DNA/dendrimer complexes may provide a novel approach to enhance gene transfer and gene expression ex vivo.
