Comparison of the psychospiritual needs of Chinese heart transplant recipients at pre- and postoperative stages. This project sought to compare Chinese heart transplant (HT) recipients' psychospiritual needs during the preoperative (PS) and the postoperative predischarge stage (PDS). Thirty HT recipients from two leading medical centers in Taiwan were recruited for this research. Data collected by face-to-face interview were analyzed by content analysis. The patients' ages ranged from 23 to 45 years (mean [M] +/- standard deviation [SD] = 28.5 +/- 4.1); 90% were married. The subjects' cardiac disease history ranged from 4.2 to 12.3 years (M +/- SD = 8.2 +/- 2.3). The waiting time list for HT ranged from 1.2 to 6.4 years (M +/- SD = 3.1 +/- 2.6). The subjects had the following six psychospiritual concerns: death (PS), unfulfilled family responsibilities (PS and PDS), unaccomplished personal life goals (PS and PDS), poor body image (PDS), loss of significant others' support and love (PDS), and discrimination by others (PDS). The following seven needs of help were reported: comforting the fear of failure in heart transplantation (PS and PDS), meeting unfulfilled family responsibilities (PS and PDS), accomplishing personal life goal (PS and PDS), religious support (PS and PDS), establishing confidence in body image (PDS), establishing positive relationship with significant others (PS and PDS), and preparation for dying with dignity when necessary (PS and PDS). The in-depth investigation on Chinese HT recipients' psychospiritual needs was first compared in PDS and PS. More distress and needs were found in PDS than PS. These findings were attributed by the dilemma of pursuing prospective future versus taking the risk of loss of life, valuing families' and health professionals' support system, and expecting grief and dying with dignity. Health professionals are encouraged to understand and provide stage-specific support to help them meet psycho-spiritual needs.
