Nutrition assessment, care, and considerations of ventricular assist device patients. A ventricular assist device (VAD) is an implantable mechanical device that is used to partially or completely replace the circulatory function of a failing heart. VADs may serve as a bridge to heart transplantation or as permanent circulatory assistance, also referred to as destination therapy. There is a paucity of information regarding the nutrition complications in VAD patients, and as such, little is presently known of the optimal means of nutrition assessment and management of these complex and often critically ill patients. In this review, a general overview of the VAD, comparisons of nutrition assessment measures, and strategies to meet the nutrition needs of these patients are provided using evidence-based information wherever possible. Because there is a lack of nutrition studies and assessment guidelines specifically for VAD patients, many of the guidelines for care of these patients are currently based on the information available for the care of patients with heart failure. Although the optimal measure to assess nutrition status remains poorly studied, a systematic, thorough nutrition assessment of patients with heart failure and heart transplant candidates prior to VAD placement appears to be important to identify those at nutrition risk and, with appropriate nutrition therapy, decrease their risk for morbidity and mortality. VAD patients with inadequate oral intake may require nutrition support to meet their nutrition needs; however, feeding the hemodynamically compromised patient provides additional challenges.
