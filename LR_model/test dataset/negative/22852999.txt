Zygomycosis over-infection during voriconazole therapy for aspergillosis in a heart transplant patient, successfully treated with liposomal amphotericin and posaconazole. Aspergillosis and zygomycosis are life-threatening fungal infections in immunocompromised patients. We report a heart transplant recipient with an early pulmonary invasive aspergillosis successfully treated with association of voriconazole and caspofungin. Zygomycosis sinusitis, which was diagnosed while he still was on voriconazole therapy, was successfully treated with the use of combination antifungal therapy including liposomal amphotericin plus posaconazole and conservative surgical debridement.
