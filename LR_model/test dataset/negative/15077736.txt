Successful combined heart-liver transplantation in a patient with hemochromatosis. Hemochromatosis is a disorder of excess iron deposition in tissues that may cause multiorgan dysfunction. Because the early symptoms of hemochromatosis are nonspecific, the diagnosis is frequently overlooked until significant organ failure has developed. The primary cause of death in these patients is usually liver cancer related to cirrhosis. Patients who are candidates for liver transplantation should be referred for evaluation. For patients with severe cardiomyopathy, in addition to end-stage liver disease, combined transplantation may be performed. Although there is a limited number of combined heart-liver transplantations that have been performed, successful outcomes can be achieved with close monitoring and a multidisciplinary team approach. In this case report, we will discuss the prevalence, pathophysiology, and treatment of hemochromatosis and potential complications of combined heart-liver transplantation.
