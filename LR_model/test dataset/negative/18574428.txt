Laparoscopic cystoprostatectomy in a heart transplant recipient. A 72-year-old orthotopic cardiac transplant recipient with multiple, previously resected, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) presented with invasive SCC of the urinary bladder. At surgery, clot retention was managed with clot evacuation and continuous bladder irrigation to facilitate dissection. Laparoscopic cystoprostatectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection with extracorporeal ileal conduit urinary diversion were performed in 6 hours without complication. This approach minimized blood loss and allowed sufficient time out of steep Trendelenberg to reequilibrate the patient's cardiovascular system. Final pathology revealed SCC with perivesical fat invasion. This immunocompromised patient remains disease free 2 months after resection.
