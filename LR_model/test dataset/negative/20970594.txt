Long-term outcome in heart transplant patients with pretransplant malignancies. Neoplasms have classically been considered a contraindication for heart transplantation (HT) because of the possibility of recurrence during immunosuppressive therapy. There are few cases of patients who suffered a pretransplant malignancy (PTM); however the appropriate interval free of a malignancy (IFoM) before heart transplantation is unclear. Our study sought to determine the long-term outcomes after transplantation among patients who had suffered a prior neoplasm compared with our overall cohort. This retrospective, single-center study included 595 heart transplant recipients ungrafted between 1991 and 2009. We determined PTM location, histology, and IFoM. We examined donor and recipient factors and post-HT data of rejections, infections, neoplasms, and survival associated with a poor prognosis. Twelve patients with different types, locations, and histological grades of PTM represented 66.7% women versus 16.1% women in the overall series (P<.01). There were no differences in recipient age or clinical characteristics (diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, previous renal failure, or New York Heart Association class), number of emergency cases, or graft ischemia time. Mean IFoM was 114.3 months (range=5.3-350.4). After heart transplantation, there were no significant differences between the number of infections (47.9%; n=[279] vs 33.3% n=4; P=.39), rejection episodes (44.4% [259] vs 50% [6], P=0.77) or post-HT malignancies (12.2% [70] vs 0%, P=0.37) between the overall series and the patients with PTM. None of the patients with PTM suffered a recurrence of the neoplasm. Actuarial survivals at 1, 3, and 5 years were 82%, 76%, and 70% among patients without PTM and 75%, 75%, and 56% among those with PTM (P=.70). Patients with PTM and an appropriate IFoM with regard to tumor lineage showed similar rates of survival and complications as those of the overall series. This series suggested that appropriately selected patients with a cured PTM can be candidates for HT.
