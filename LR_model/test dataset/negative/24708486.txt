Angiopoietin-2 inhibition prevents transplant ischemia-reperfusion injury and chronic rejection in rat cardiac allografts. Transplant ischemia-reperfusion injury (Tx-IRI) and allograft dysfunction remain as two of the major clinical challenges after heart transplantation. We investigated the role of angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) in Tx-IRI and rejection using fully MHC-mismatched rat cardiac allografts. We report that plasma levels of Ang2 were significantly enhanced in the human and rat recipients of cardiac allografts, but not in the rat recipients of syngrafts, during IRI. Ex vivo intracoronary treatment of rat cardiac allografts with anti-Ang2 antibody before 4-h cold preservation prevented microvascular dysfunction, endothelial cell (EC) adhesion molecule expression and leukocyte infiltration, myocardial injury and the development of cardiac fibrosis and allograft vasculopathy. Recipient preoperative and postoperative treatment with anti-Ang2 antibody produced otherwise similar effects without effecting microvascular dysfunction, and in additional experiments prolonged allograft survival. Recipient preoperative treatment alone failed to produce these effects. Moreover, ex vivo intracoronary treatment of allografts with recombinant Ang2 enhanced Tx-IRI and, in an add-back experiment, abolished the beneficial effect of the antibody. We demonstrate that neutralization of Ang2 prevents EC activation, leukocyte infiltration, Tx-IRI and the development of chronic rejection in rat cardiac allografts. Our results suggest that blocking Ang2 pathway is a novel, clinically feasible, T cell-independent strategy to protect cardiac allografts.
