Expression of H60 on mice heart graft and influence of cyclosporine. It has been reported that the MHC class I chain-related antigen (MIC), a ligand of NKG2D, an activating receptor of natural killer cells, is expressed on rejected renal allografts. This study investigated whether heart transplantation induced expression of a homologue of MIC (H60) in outbred Kun Ming (KM) mice, widely used in China, and whether CsA had an influence on the process. Forty-eight KM female mice were divided into untreated and CsA-treated groups, after cervical heart allotransplantation. Grafts were harvested 1, 3, 5, and 7 days postoperatively. H60 mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR, and the protein detected by immunohistochemistry. Compared with no mRNA expression in the normal heart, H60 mRNA was observed at day 5 and upregulated on day 7 in the untreated group. It was detected on day 3, peaked on day 5, but was lower than untreated group, and decreased on day 7 in the CsA-treated group. H60 protein was detected in cardiocytes only on day 7 in the untreated group. Our study suggested that expression of the NKG2D ligand, H60, may activate natural killer cells playing a significant role in innate immunity associated with transplantation. The early expression of H60 mRNA on day 3 in the CsA-treated group might relate to the toxicity of CsA. The expression peaked on day 5 and decreased on day 7, possibly induced by CsA. The results suggested that H60 might be a new target for prevention of rejection.
