Long-term support with milrinone prior to cardiac transplantation in a neonate with left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy. A 2-week-old female infant presented with acute decompensated left ventricular failure. Echocardiography diagnosed left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy with dilated phenotype and a left ventricular shortening fraction <10%. The infant was mechanically ventilated for 2 weeks and then successfully extubated. She was maintained on intravenous milrinone for 6 months until she underwent successful orthotopic heart transplantation. Young children can be supported with inotropes for prolonged periods while awaiting heart transplantation.
