The first cardiac transplant experience in a patient with mucopolysaccharidosis. Hunter syndrome (MPSII) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder that can affect multiple systems but primarily affects the heart. We report the case of a previously asymptomatic 23-year-old patient who had an attenuated form of MPSII and presented with refractory heart failure that required a heart transplant. The diagnosis was confirmed by detection of an increase in urinary excretion of glycosaminoglycans, a deficiency in enzymatic activity, and molecular analysis. A myocardial biopsy revealed hypertrophic cardiomyocytes, mild fibrosis, and lysosomal storage in interstitial cells. Molecular analysis identified a novel mutation in the iduronate-2-sulfatase gene. Although the clinical outcome was not favorable, we believe that this approach may be valid in end-stage heart failure.
