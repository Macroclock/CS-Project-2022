Diagnosis and Management of Chagas Cardiomyopathy in the United States. Chagas cardiomyopathy is an emerging form of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy in the USA. This review aims to summarize current concepts in pathophysiology, disease transmission, medical therapy, and heart transplantation for patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. The incidence of Chagas cardiomyopathy is increasing in the USA, driven mainly by immigration from countries where Chagas disease is endemic. Chagas cardiomyopathy is a chronic, progressive myocarditis, with hallmark features of biventricular dysfunction, ventricular arrhythmias, thromboembolic complications, and a high risk of mortality. Currently, there is no effective treatment for chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. Heart transplantation is the only treatment for patients with end-stage Chagas cardiomyopathy, but is associated with unique challenges including risk of reactivation. As the prevalence of Chagas cardiomyopathy increases in the USA, practitioners must be aware of the unique challenges in diagnosis and management that Chagas cardiomyopathy presents.
