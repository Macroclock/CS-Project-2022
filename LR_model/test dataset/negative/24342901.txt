Pediatric ventricular assist device use as a bridge to transplantation does not affect long-term quality of life. The present study sought to determine the long-term quality of life (QOL) of children who required long-term ventricular assist device (VAD) support as a bridge to transplantation (BTT) compared with children who underwent heart transplantation without VAD support. Currently, 20% of children undergoing heart transplantation have required a VAD as a BTT. Few data have been published assessing how children requiring a VAD as a BTT will fair in terms of their long-term QOL. The present study used a cross-sectional design, using the Core and Cardiac modules of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory survey. In a secondary analysis, the factors associated with worse QOL outcomes among the VAD patients were also investigated. At follow-up (median, 4.2 years), between the 21 children who required a VAD as a BTT and 42 who went straight to transplantation, no significant differences were found in the QOL as measured using the Psychosocial Health Summary Score, Physical Health Summary Score, or Total Score in the survey's Core Module, nor were any differences found in the outcomes assessed using the survey's Cardiac Module. Of the patients who required a VAD, only the presence of a neurologic complication was associated with worse QOL, which was demonstrated by decreased Physical Health Summary and Cardiac Communication scores. Over the long term, surviving children who required a long-term VAD as a BTT experience a similar QOL as those who went straight to transplantation.
