Localized immunosuppression in the cardiac allograft induced by a new liposome-mediated IL-10 gene therapy. Overexpression of interleukin 10 (IL-10) in the donor heart prolongs allograft survival in animals. Interleukin-10 has many immunosuppressive effects; however, the mechanism(s) of its protective effect on allograft rejection remains unknown. Recently, we optimized an ex vivo, intracoronary infusion of the GAP:DLRIE, liposome-mediated, IL-10 gene method using a rabbit, cervical, heterotopic heart transplant model. The efficiency of this new-generation, liposome-mediated, IL-10 gene transfer to the donor hearts was 15% in hypothermic conditions, which represents a 30% increase from the efficiency of other liposomes, such as DOSPA/DOPE, DOGS/DOPE, and DMRIE/DOPE. Cardiac allograft survival was prolonged from 6.0 +/- 0.7 days to 14.3 +/- 1.8 days. Infiltrating lymphocyte sub-populations CD3+, CD4+, and CD8) decreased significantly in the gene therapy group compared with the control group. Local IL-10 overexpression correlated significantly with decreased CD4+ and CD8+ responsiveness and Type-1 helper (Th1) cytokine gene (IL-2, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) expression level and correlated inversely with the allograft rejection grade. In the gene therapy group, the cytotoxic activity of infiltrating T cells in the allograft decreased greatly, but the time course of this decrease did not parallel the rejection process. We conclude that GAP:DLRIE is the best cationic liposome for ex vivo gene transfection in hypothermic conditions. The effects of IL-10 gene therapy on antigen-specific T-lymphocyte proliferation and Th1-cytokine expression may play an important role in localized immunosuppression and tolerance induction.
