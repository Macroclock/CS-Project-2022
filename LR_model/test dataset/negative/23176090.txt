Endovascular Mycobacterium abscessus infection in a heart transplant recipient: a case report and review of the literature. Nontuberculous mycobacteria are ubiquitous in the environment. Although rarely a cause of infection in immunocompetent individuals, increased risk and severity of infection are seen in patients who are immunocompromised, such as those with solid organ transplants. In this report, we describe the first case of disseminated endovascular Mycobacterium abscessus in a heart transplant recipient. A review of the literature regarding this infection in heart transplant recipients and its therapeutic options and concerns are summarized.
