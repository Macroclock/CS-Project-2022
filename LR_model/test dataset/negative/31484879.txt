Cilostazol Is Useful for the Treatment of Sinus Bradycardia and Associated Hemodynamic Deterioration Following Heart Transplantation. Bradycardia is a common complication at the early postoperative period after heart transplantation (HT). The heart rate (HR) usually recovers within a few weeks; however, several patients need a temporary pacemaker or chronotropic agents to stabilize their hemodynamics. Here, we report the first case of transient bradycardia associated with hemodynamic deterioration following HT, which was successfully treated with cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase-3-inhibiting agent. A 59-year-old man received HT for advanced heart failure due to ischemic cardiomyopathy. General fatigue persisted even after the HT. His HR was around 60 beats per minute (bpm) with sinus rhythm. Echocardiography showed no abnormal findings. Right heart catheterization showed that the cardiac index (CI) was 1.9 L/minute/m 'Advanced heart failure', 'Complication', 'Phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor'
