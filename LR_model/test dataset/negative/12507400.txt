Evaluation of peripheral blood CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte subsets, CD69 expression and histologic rejection grade as diagnostic markers for the presence of cardiac allograft rejection. We investigated the dynamics of the CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte subsets, and the expression of activation markers in cardiac transplant recipients. We tested 132 peripheral blood samples from 62 cardiac transplant recipients using fluorescent staining and flow cytometry analysis. The results were correlated with histological rejection grade of concurrently taken biopsies, and 5-year survival of the recipients. A decrease in the total T lymphocyte subset, and in CD4+ lymphocytes was associated with higher rejection grade and lesser survival. An increase (5-11%) of double positive CD4+ CD8+ lymphocytes was observed; these were mostly CD4brightCD8dim. The CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly (P < 0.00) lower in the transplant recipients than in normal individuals. CD69 expression was higher than CD54 and CD154 expression on CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes of cardiac transplant recipients; correlation between these activation markers was excellent (P < 0.001). Fluorescent staining for CD69 was often of low intensity. Multiple regression for % CD8+ CD69+ cells and survival, and for % CD69+ T cells and rejection grade yielded a significant correlation (P < 0.050). Both % CD8+ CD69+ and % CD69+ T cells were significantly higher in samples with severe and moderate rejection grade (grades 3A, 3B and 4) than in samples which showed no, minimal or mild rejection (grades < or = 2); P-values were 0.052 and 0.003, respectively. Preliminary results indicated that false negative results could be contributed to increased immunosuppression. We conclude that CD69 expression on circulating CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes is a useful parameter for the diagnosis of moderate and severe rejection.
