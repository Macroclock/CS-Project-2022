Mechanism of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase inhibiting cardiac allograft rejection in mice. Indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO)-mediated regulation of tryptophan metabolism plays an important role in immune tolerance in transplantation, but it has not been elucidated which mechanism specifically induces the occurrence of immune tolerance. Our study revealed that IDO exerts immunosuppressive effects through two pathways in mouse heart transplantation, 'tryptophan depletion' and 'tryptophan metabolite accumulation'. The synergism between IDO 'allograft rejection', 'cardiac transplantation', 'immune tolerance', 'indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase'
