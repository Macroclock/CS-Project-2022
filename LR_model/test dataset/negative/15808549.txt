Efficiency of adenovirus-mediated gene transduction in heart grafts in rats. We determined the characteristics of transgene expression of heart grafts following ex vivo gene transfer using an adenovirus vector. Transgene expression was assessed periodically in the same animals by a non-invasive bioimaging system. Rat heterotopic heart transplantation was performed in a syngenic combination. We infused 1 x 10(9) plaque-forming units of adenovirus vectors containing firefly luciferase gene into the heart graft via the coronary artery, with preservation at 4 degrees C and transplanted into the cervix of the recipient. Transgene expression was periodically visualized and quantified by a noninvasive bioimaging system without sacrificing experimental animals. Transgene expression in the graft peaked at day 7 and then fell gradually. Transgene expression was also observed in the recipient liver. We have determined the time course of transgene expression in the heart graft. This constitutes important information about ex vivo gene therapy for heart grafts.
