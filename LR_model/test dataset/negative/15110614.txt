Impella recover 100 microaxial left ventricular assist device: the Niguarda experience. The Impella Recover 100 (IR100) is an intravascular microaxial blood pump used to support blood circulation for a maximum of 7 days in cases of reduced left ventricular function, for example in postcardiotomy low output syndrome or in cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction. We supported five patients with the IR100. The mean age, cardiac index (CI), and ejection fraction (EF) of our population were 42 years, 1.83 L/min/m(2), and 20%, respectively. Two patients (group A) with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy were bridged to heart transplant. Two patients (group B) with fulminan myocarditis and septic shock were bridged to recovery. One patient, with severe valvular cardiomyopathy who underwent aortic valve replacement and mitral valve annuloplasty, was supported to weaning from ECC. Mean support time was 9.8 +/- 2.3 days. Only one acute myocarditis patient died from a severe vasoplegic syndrome despite maximal inotropic and vasoactive support. Both group A patients were successfully transplanted. Among group B, the second patient resolved the septic status and was slowly weaned from the device and discharged home with moderate improvement of LV function (EF = 40%). Patient C was weaned from the IR100 and electively placed on the heart transplant recipient list. IR100 is a device that in our experience can be utilized for various indications for short-term support. In compromised patients where a traditional LVAD is contraindicated, the IR100 showed good results, for it is minimally invasive and does not need ECC or systemic anticoagulation.
