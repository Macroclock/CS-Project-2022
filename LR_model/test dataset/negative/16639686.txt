Heart transplantation after Fontan's procedure with bilateral cavopulmonary connections. We present a young female patient with three caval drainages after complete Fontan's procedure and with bilateral bidirectional cavopulmonary connections who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation. Instead of reconstructing the hypoplastic innominate vein the persistent left superior caval vein was reanastomosed via the recipient's coronary sinus into the right atrium.
