Cytomegalovirus infection and allograft rejection among pediatric heart transplant recipients in the era of valganciclovir prophylaxis. CMV infection remains a significant cause of morbidity among pediatric HTx recipients We explored the implications of CMV infection on post-transplant outcomes among CMV risk-stratified pediatric HTx recipients receiving VGC prophylaxis. Children who underwent HTx between January 2010 and October 2016 were stratified according to CMV risk at time of transplant and evaluated for evidence of post-transplant CMV infection, rejection, CAV, and graft loss. Among 97 children, 41 (42%) were considered HR or IR risk for CMV infection and received VGC prophylaxis. CMV DNAemia was observed in 34% of children, including 71% HR, 40% IR, and 18% LR individuals. Median time to CMV DNAemia following VGC prophylaxis was 32D among HR vs 277D in IR subjects (P = .042). No difference in overall graft loss was noted among groups, but CMV HR children had decreased rejection-free survival (3.5 years) compared to IR (6 years, P = .015) and LR children (8 years, P = .0003). CMV was noted on EMB in 13% of children but was not associated with increased CAV, rejection or graft loss. High-risk CMV status was associated with decreased time to CMV infection despite VGC prophylaxis, compared to IR, and decreased rejection-free survival times compared to both IR and LR recipients. Detection of CMV on EMB was not associated with increased rejection, CAV or graft loss. Additional studies are needed to explore the impact of CMV infection on rejection-free survival in HTx recipients.
