Impact of Left Ventricular Assist Device Exchange on Outcomes After Heart Transplantation. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are the most common mode of circulatory support for patients awaiting heart transplantation. Unfortunately, a fraction of these patients require pump exchange during their course for pump-related adverse events. This study examined whether LVAD exchanges affect posttransplantation outcomes. This study focused on adult patients in the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database who were bridged to transplant with a LVAD implanted between 2007 and 2017. Patients who underwent LVAD exchange were compared with those supported with a single device. The primary end point was all-cause mortality at 1, 2, and 5 years after transplantation. The impact of device exchange on risk-adjusted outcomes was examined using Cox proportional hazards models. Among 8239 patients who met the inclusion criteria, there were 611 pump exchanges in 560 patients (7% of recipients). The pump exchange rate was 6.24 events per 100 patient-years. Survival at 5 years was lower for those who underwent LVAD exchange (69.4% vs 77.5%, log-rank P = .027). This finding was similar for risk-adjusted 5-year mortality (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.67; P = .003). Subgroup analysis revealed lower 5-year survival for female recipients who underwent LVAD exchange (55.4% vs 79.7%, log-rank P < .001). The interaction between female sex and LVAD exchange was associated with increased risk-adjusted 5-year mortality (hazard ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 2.59; P = .030). Recipients who underwent pump exchange while awaiting heart transplantation had a higher mortality compared with those on a primary device. Subgroup analysis revealed a marked increase in mortality of female recipients who experienced LVAD exchange.
