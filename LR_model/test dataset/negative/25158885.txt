ABO blood group antibody levels in infants exposed to mechanical circulatory support. ABO sensitization is a barrier to ABO-incompatible heart transplantation in infants. We investigate the development of ABO antibodies in infants with and without mechanical circulatory support (MCS) during their waiting period. Although the proportion of patients with antibodies was similar between the groups, the median age at antibody detection was only 9 days (6-198) for MCS vs. 223 days (28-367) for non-MCS patients (P = 0.028), suggesting MCS is associated with earlier ABO antibody detection.
