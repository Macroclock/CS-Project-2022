Comparison of tuberculin skin test and interferon gamma release assay in pediatric candidates of heart transplantation and a 2-year follow-up. Currently, tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) are used to find the latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) cases in the candidates of heart transplantation. Therefore, this study aimed to compare TST and IGRA to diagnose LTBI in pediatric heart transplant candidates. This cross-sectional study was performed on 50 children, who were candidates for heart transplantation, of whom 42 cases underwent heart transplantation in Shahid Rajaie Cardiovascular, Medical, and Research center, Tehran, Iran, from 2016 to 2017. Participants of the study included 24 male patients (%48) (p-value = 0.67). The mean age of the patients was 8.18 ± 4.27 years (1-16 years). According to the results, IGRA was negative in all patients, and no indeterminate result was reported, while the purified derivative test (PPD) was positive in three (6%) cases. In comparison with QFT, an accuracy of 94% was achieved for TST to diagnose Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. It seems that TST can still be used as an accurate test for screening LTBI in pediatric candidates for heart transplantation.
