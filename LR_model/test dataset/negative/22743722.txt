Association of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF- β1) with gingival hyperplasia in heart transplant patients undergoing cyclosporine-A treatment. Gingival hyperplasia is a common complication of immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine A (CyA). However, the association of CyA with increased tissue concentrations of TGF- β(1), a potential causative factor of hyperplasia, remains unknown. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of TGF- β(1) and IL-2 on the development and maintenance of gingival hyperplasia in patients treated with CyA after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). Gingival hyperplasia was indexed in 60 patients, in accordance with McGraw and Potter scale. Patients were divided and comparisons were made among 3 groups: Group A (18 patients; 49.0 ± 12.1 y/o) after OHT with gingival hyperplasia (score 1, 2, 3), Group B (12 patients; 40.0 ± 15.1 y/o) after OHT without gingival hyperplasia (score 0), and Group C - the control group - (30 patients; 42.0 ± 10.8 y/o) with clinically healthy paradentium. Cytokines (TGF- β(1) and IL-2) were marked in gingival tissue homogenate. The concentration of CyA was marked in the patients' blood (Groups A and B). The highest mean concentration of TGF- β(1) was obtained in Group A and the lowest concentration was in the control group. A positive correlation was found between TGF- β(1) in gingival tissue and CyA blood concentration in Groups A and B. TGF- β(1) is associated with gingival hyperplasia in patients treated with CyA after OHT procedure.
