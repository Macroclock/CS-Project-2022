Vascular effects of sildenafil in hypertensive cardiac transplant recipients. Sildenafil is commonly used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in hypertensive male cardiac transplant recipients (CTR); however, little is known about the vascular effects of sildenafil in these patients. Central and peripheral arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and brachial artery reactivity were determined in 15 hypertensive male CTR before and after oral sildenafil (50 mg) administration. Sildenafil improved brachial and aortic systolic BP, pulse pressure, aortic augmentation index, left ventricular tension time index, travel time of the reflected aortic pressure wave, and brachial artery reactivity (P <.01 for each comparison). No patient became hypotensive with sildenafil despite continuation of usual antihypertensive medications. Sildenafil (50 mg) is well tolerated in hypertensive CTR and improves BP, aortic augmentation index, and endothelial function. By decreasing the amplitude of the reflected pressure wave and delaying its return to the heart, sildenafil reduces left ventricular afterload and systolic stress.
