Artemisinin Attenuates Transplant Rejection by Inhibiting Multiple Lymphocytes and Prolongs Cardiac Allograft Survival. Immunological rejection is an important factor resulting in allograft dysfunction, and more valid therapeutic methods need to be explored to improve allograft outcomes. Many researches have indicated that artemisinin and its derivative exhibits immunosuppressive functions, apart from serving as a traditional anti-malarial drug. In this assay, we further explored the therapeutic effects of artemisinin for transplant rejection in a rat cardiac transplantation model. We found that it markedly attenuated allograft rejection and histological injury and significantly prolonged the survival of allograft. Upon further exploring the mechanism, we demonstrated that artemisinin not only attenuated T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) by reducing effector T cell infiltration and inflammatory cytokine secretion and increasing regulatory T cell infiltration and immunoregulatory cytokine levels, but also attenuated antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) through inhibition of B cells activation and antibody production. Furthermore, artemisinin also reduced macrophage infiltration in allografts, which was determined to be important for TCMR and ABMR. Moreover, we demonstrated that artemisinin significantly inhibited the function of pure T cells, B cells, and macrophages  'T cell-mediated rejection', 'antibody-mediated rejection', 'artemisinin', 'cardiac transplantation', 'transplant rejection'
