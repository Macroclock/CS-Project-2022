Sleep-disordered breathing in heart failure patients after ventricular assist device implantation and heart transplantation. Chronic heart failure (CHF) represents a major health and economic burden and is associated with high rates of hospital admission, morbidity, mortality and decreased quality-adjusted life years. New advances in the treatment of CHF such as ventricular assist devices (VADs) and heart transplantation have helped improve outcomes. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is highly prevalent in CHF patients and the associated morbidity makes it essential for physicians to be more cognizant about its existence, interaction and need for treatment. This is a review of what is known to date about SDB in CHF patients who have undergone advanced treatments with VADs and/or heart transplantation.
