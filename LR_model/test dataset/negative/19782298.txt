Heart transplantation for ventricular arrhythmia caused by a rare hamartoma. Hamartoma of mature cardiac myocytes is a form of cardiac tumor that shares some features with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and rhabdomyomas. Here we describe a patient with a ventricular hamartoma complicated with ventricular tachycardia. Resection was not practical because of difficulty in maintaining the ventricular geometry, so heart transplantation was done.
