Effect of Hepatitis C Virus Infection on Heart Transplants in the Current Era. The effect of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in recipients or donors on heart transplants is less known in the current era after the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) in 2011. Using the United Network for Organ Sharing registry, 24 871 adult heart transplant recipients between 2005 and 2019 were identified. The trend in prevalence of HCV-infected recipients and in utilization of HCV-infected donors and their effect on the transplant outcomes were investigated in the past era versus the current era separated by 2011, using Cox proportional hazard regression. HCV antibody-positive recipients (n = 520, 2.1%) had stable prevalence (P = 0.18). They had a lower survival estimate when compared with HCV antibody-negative recipients in the past era (55.3% versus 70.9% at 7 y; hazard ratio [HR], 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-1.91; P < 0.001), however not in the current era (73.1% versus 71.5% at 7 y; HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.75-1.32; P = 0.98) (Pinteraction < 0.001). Organ use from HCV antibody-positive donors (n = 371, 1.5%) was concentrated in the recent years (P < 0.001) and provided the similar survival estimate up to 2 y (84.2% versus 87.6%; HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.65-1.44; P = 0.87). The similar findings were confirmed with a subgroup cohort with positive nucleic acid amplification test. Positive HCV antibody in recipients did not adversely affect the long-term transplant outcomes in the current era. Graft utilization from positive HCV antibody or nucleic acid amplification test-positive donors are rapidly more prevalent and appeared to be promising up to 2 y posttransplant.
