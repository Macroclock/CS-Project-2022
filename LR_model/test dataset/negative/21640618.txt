Successful use of a pneumatic biventricular assist device as a bridge to transplantation in cardiogenic shock. Mechanical circulatory support is a highly effective technology to maintain organ perfusion in patients with cardiogenic shock as a bridge to transplantation. Although implantation of a left ventricular assist device alone is often the preferred configuration, patients with biventricular failure and significant end-organ dysfunction often require biventricular assistance. Between January 2000 and September 2008, 80 patients with severe biventricular failure were accepted for heart transplantation and received a pneumatic biventricular assist devices as a bridge to transplant. Patients were retrospectively divided into 2 groups: those successfully bridged to transplant (Group A) and those who died (Group B). Patients were also divided into 2 periods of implantation: Group X (2000-2005) and Group Y (2006-2008, which used a multidiscipline selection process). Overall success rate to transplantation was 71.3%, with Group Y demonstrating an 82% success to transplant rate vs 63% in Group X. One-year actuarial survival after transplant was 89% compared with 92% in patients without a ventricular assist device. There were no statistically significant laboratory parameters between Groups A and B identifying potential risk factors for poor outcome. Biventricular assist device therapy represents an effective and reliable means of supporting selected Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support profile 1 patients as a bridge to transplantation, with excellent success to transplant rates and post-transplant survival.
