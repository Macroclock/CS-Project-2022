Neurologic aspects of heart transplantation. Cardiac transplantation remains the best treatment option for patients with end-stage, NYHA class IV heart failure who have failed conventional therapy. However, transplant rates have remained static largely due to limited organ donor supplies. Therefore, appropriate allocation of this precious resource is critical to maximize benefit, both at a patient level and at a societal level. Neurologic diseases, such as cerebrovascular disease and peripheral neuropathy, are prevalent in this patient population, as the major risk factors for heart disease place patients at risk for neurologic disease as well. Examples include hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and diabetes. Pretransplant neurologic evaluation is very important to identify conditions that may limit survival after cardiac transplantation. In general, systemic diseases exacerbated by immunosuppression, conditions limiting ability to rehabilitate, and dementias are considered contraindications. Post-transplant neurologic complications are divided into central versus peripheral, and early versus late. The most common early complication is ischemic stroke. Other serious complications include hemorrhagic stroke, encephalopathy, and critical illness neuropathy. Over the long term, post-transplant immunosuppressive regimens are considered "a double edged sword." Although immunosuppressive medications are critical to preventing rejection and allograft dysfunction, they do have significant risk of morbidity and mortality associated with them, including neurologic side-effects. These include: (1) drug toxicities, such as lowering of seizure thresholds; (2) encephalopathy, such as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES); (3) infections; (4) malignancies, such as post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Many of the same considerations discussed in adult heart transplant recipients apply to pediatric heart transplant recipients as well. In children, seizures are the most common neurologic complication, although other neurologic complication rates are comparable.
