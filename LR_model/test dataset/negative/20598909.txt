Idiopathic massive myocardial calcification: a case report and review of the literature. We report a rare case of massive myocardial calcification in a 42-year-old male who presented with symptoms of congestive heart failure and arrhythmia. Myocardial calcification is most commonly associated with myocardial infarction or, less commonly, hypercalcemia. This case is particularly unusual due to the lack of any known predisposing risk factors, including normal coronary arteries, normal renal function, and normal serum calcium levels. Alternative etiologies are discussed accompanied by a review of the literature.
