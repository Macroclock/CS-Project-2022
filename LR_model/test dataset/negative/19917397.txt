Usefulness of sirolimus as rescue therapy in heart transplant recipients with renal failure: analysis of the Spanish Multicenter Observational Study (RAPACOR). Chronic renal failure is a common complication of heart transplantation. Sirolimus (SRL) is an immunosuppressive drug that, unlike calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), is not associated with nephrotoxicity. We collected efficacy and safety data from a Spanish registry of heart transplant recipients who were switched from a CNI to SRL due to renal failure. Patients were included if the serum creatinine level before switching was >1.5 mg/dL and/or the estimated creatinine clearance level was below 50 mL/min. Ninety-seven patients started SRL due to renal impairment. When SRL was started, CNIs were progressively tapered and in some cases withdrawn. Mean baseline creatinine level was 2.5 mg/dL and mean creatinine clearance level was 39 mL/min. Only 1 episode of acute rejection was observed in a patient receiving SRL plus cyclosporine (CsA) but the eventual allograft function remained stable. Compared with baseline, a significant improvement in renal function was observed at 6 months among patients who stopped CNIs before the third month after SRL was started, although not among those who continued taking CNIs. Upon multivariate analysis, no predictors of response were observed. SRL was withdrawn in 18% of patients due to adverse events. Switching to SRL was safe in heart allograft recipients, improving renal function among those previously receiving a CNI. Renal function improves if CNIs are withdrawn soon after starting SRL.
