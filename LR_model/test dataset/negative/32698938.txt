Levosimendan as a bridge to heart transplant in a 16-year-old patient with univentricular heart. We report the successful use of levosimendan in the treatment of heart failure in a patient with the univentricular heart. The presented case was atypical because our patient had systemic right ventricle. To our knowledge, it is the first reported such case with intermittent levosimendan administration as an effective treatment and bridge to successful heart transplant in a patient with functionally univentricular heart.
