Impaired left atrial function in clinically well heart transplant patients. Left atrial (LA) enlargement is present in the majority of adult heart transplant (HT) recipients. We used speckle-tracking echocardiography to investigate whether LA phasic function in HT patients is altered and explored its relationship to HT-related clinical variables. This study evaluated LA function in 112 clinically well HT patients and 40 healthy controls. Clinical data included recipient age at HT, donor age, ischemia time, left ventricular function, and biochemical indicators. Atrial deformation and volume indices were measured with two-dimensional and three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography, respectively. Components of phasic atrial function were calculated and correlations to clinical variables were explored. Compared with controls, HT patients had worse LA reservoir, conduit, and pump function. LA reservoir function of the bicaval group was better than the biatrial group, but differences did not persist after adjustment for potential confounders. Among patients with HT, those with lower LAS-peak had an older recipient age, larger LA volume, as well as worse left ventricular systolic function than those patients with higher LAS-peak. However, E/e', biochemical indicators and donor-related information were similar across the quartiles of LA function. In HT cohort, we observed impairment in all phases of LA function, and LA reservoir function was decreased independent of surgical technique. LAS-peak was associated with worse left ventricular systolic function, which suggested that LA function may play an important role in HT patients.
