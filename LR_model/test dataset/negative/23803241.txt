Use of a totally artificial heart for a complex postinfarction ventricular septal defect. The incidence of cardiac rupture complicating myocardial infarction has declined since the introduction of thrombolytic therapy. Despite the advances in the management of myocardial infarction, cardiac rupture remains an important cause of death among infarction-related fatalities. We discuss a patient who presented to our hospital with myocardial infarction and who subsequently developed a complex ventricular septal rupture, for which surgical repair was not feasible. Implantation of a CardioWest Total Artificial Heart (SynCardia Systems) allowed for immediate hemodynamic stabilization and served as a bridge to transplantation.
