Confirmation of Chagas' cardiomyopathy following heart transplantation. We report a case of Chagas' cardiomyopathy confirmed in a patient after heart transplantation. The patient initially presented with symptoms of congestive heart failure and was found to have positive serology for prior Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Despite optimal medical management, the patient had deterioration of his cardiac function and he underwent heart transplantation. Pathology examination of the explanted heart confirmed Chagas' cardiomyopathy. The cardiac sequelae of Chagas' disease include arrhythmias, aneurysm, thromboembolism, cardiomyopathy, and sudden death. We review the epidemiology, cardiac pathology, and evaluation of patients with Chagas' cardiac disease. We discuss the clinical features of Chagas' cardiomyopathy and available treatments including cardiac transplantation.
