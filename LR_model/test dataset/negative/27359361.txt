Simvastatin Treatment Upregulates Anti-Fibrotic Bone Morphogenetic Protein-7 Expression at Rat Cardiac Allograft Rejection. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-7 mediates ischemic tolerance and anti-fibrotic effects in various organs such as kidney and heart. Recently, reno- and podocyte-protective effects of a potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, pitavastatin, were accompanied by BMP-7 upregulation. Here, we investigated the effect of simvastatin treatment on BMP-7 expression in major MHC-mismatched rat cardiac allografts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury and adaptive immune activation at 10 days. We localized Smad2 activity and Reca-1+ fibroblast specific protein-1+ immunoreactivity, suggesting endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, at fibrotic borderline of cardiac allografts at 10 days. Simvastatin donor and recipient combination treatment significantly upregulated cardiac allograft BMP-7 expression when compared to nontreated controls at 10 days. The beneficial effect of statin treatment on cardiac allograft may in part be mediated through the upregulation of BMP-7.
