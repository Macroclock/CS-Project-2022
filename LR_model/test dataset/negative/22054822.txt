Heart transplantation. Cardiac transplantation remains a life-prolonging process. Survival after heart transplantation has improved despite a sicker incoming patient population. The field of heart transplantation is constantly evolving. Advances in organ preservation, immune monitoring, and improved immunosuppressive regimens will continue to develop over time. The impact of the newest immunosuppressive agents and protocols, improved diagnostic testing, and new management strategies is yet to be determined. The potential of cell therapy is still under evaluation and the field is still in its infancy but rapidly evolving; the key to the future in this field may not be the delivery of the cells themselves but understanding how they interact with one another at a molecular level and, in particular, with resident stem cells in cardiac tissue. In addition to the medical advances, health care professionals need to educate the public about the benefits of transplantation as well.
