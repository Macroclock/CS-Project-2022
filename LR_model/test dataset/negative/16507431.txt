Effects of heart transplantation on cerebral metabolic abnormalities in patients with congestive heart failure. We investigated the serial changes in cerebral metabolites in 34 patients with congestive heart failure before and 2 and 12 months after heart transplantation, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Regional differences were detected in the recovery of cerebral metabolites after the heart transplantation procedure.
