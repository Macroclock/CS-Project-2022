Troponin T levels in baboons with pig heterotopic heart transplants. Troponin T levels have been monitored in baboons (n = 8) undergoing pig heterotopic heart transplantation, and correlated with a decrease in graft contractions and graft survival. Pig heart graft survival was from 12 to 139 days (mean 45, median 33), and graft failure was associated with predominant thrombotic microangiopathy and ischemia, with focal hemorrhage, and edema. An increase in troponin T levels 5 to 6 days before graft failure correlated closely with diminished graft contractions. An increase in troponin T was a reliable indicator that graft dysfunction was occurring.
