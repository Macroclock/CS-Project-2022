Aortobronchial Fistula Causing Recurrent Hemoptysis 21 Years Post-Heart Transplant. Aortobronchial fistulae (ABF) are uncommon but potentially fatal anomalies. Patients may initially present with small volume hemoptysis, which can rapidly lead to massive hemoptysis and death if not diagnosed and intervened upon early. Diagnosis by imaging and bronchoscopy is not always conclusive; thus, a high index of suspicion is necessary to diagnose this life-threatening condition. Herein, we describe a case of a young man who had a late presentation of ABF 21 years following heart transplantation. This case illustrates the diagnostic and clinical challenge of ABF as a late sequela of cardiac transplantation and highlights the rarity of this anomaly.
