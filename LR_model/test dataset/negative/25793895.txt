The liver in heart failure: a biopsy and explant series of the histopathologic and laboratory findings with a particular focus on pre-cardiac transplant evaluation. The pathologic liver changes in chronic heart failure have been characterized mostly based on autopsy series and include sinusoidal dilation and congestion progressing to pericellular fibrosis, bridging fibrosis, and ultimately to cardiac cirrhosis or sclerosis. Liver biopsies are commonly obtained as part of the work up before heart transplantation in patients with longstanding right heart failure, particularly if ascites, abnormal liver function tests or abnormal abdominal imaging are noted as part of the pre-transplant evaluation. In these cases, the liver biopsy findings may be used to further risk stratify patients for isolated heart or combined heart and liver transplantation. Thus, it is important to be able to correlate the histologic changes with post-transplant outcomes. We report the pathologic and clinical findings in liver explants from six patients who underwent combined heart-liver transplantation. We also report preoperative liver biopsy findings from 21 patients who underwent heart transplantation without simultaneous liver transplantation. We staged the changes related to chronic passive congestion as follows: stage 0-no fibrosis; stage I-pericellular fibrosis; stage II-bridging fibrosis; and stage III-regenerative nodules. Nineteen biopsies showed fibrosis with bridging fibrosis in 13 and regenerative nodules in 6. Fifteen patients were alive at 1 year post transplant. Only three patients had a post-operative course that was characterized by signs and symptoms of chronic liver disease. Pre-transplant liver biopsies from these patients all showed at least stage II fibrosis. These patients survived for 3, 6, and 10 months after cardiac transplant. The presence of bridging fibrosis was not significantly associated with post-operative survival (P=0.336) or post-operative liver failure (P=0.257). We conclude that patients with bridging fibrosis may still be considered viable candidates for isolated heart transplantation. Because the pattern of fibrosis due to passive congestion is highly variable throughout the liver, a diagnosis of cirrhosis, which implies fibrosis and regenerative nodules throughout the liver, should be made with great caution on biopsy.
