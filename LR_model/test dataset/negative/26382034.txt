Congenital atresia of the left main coronary artery in an adult: A rare anomaly with an unfavorable prognosis. Review of the literature. Congenital atresia of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) is one of the rarest congenital anomalies, which may have an unfavorable prognosis leading to myocardial ischemia, ventricle dysfunction or even sudden cardiac death. There are 34 cases of LMCA in adults reported in the literature, most of them successfully treated with coronary revascularization. We report the case of an adult with LMCA who presented with terminal heart failure that required biventricular assistance and heart transplant.
