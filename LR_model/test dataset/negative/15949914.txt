[Anthracycline-induced heart failure aggravated by pregnancy. Survival after cardiac assistance with artificial heart device and heart transplantation]. We report a case of a young woman suffering from a steady anthracycline-induced myocardiopathy with a decreased left ventricular function on echocardiography. A pregnancy was initiated, without worsening of the cardiopathy until 34 weeks. Nine days after delivery, an acute heart failure was observed leading to heart transplantation after cardiac assistance with heart cardiac device. As pregnancy is an extended stress test for a chronic failing heart, a multidisciplinary decision of pregnancy initiation and follow up should be preferred in pre and postpartum period, when such a cardiopathy exists.
