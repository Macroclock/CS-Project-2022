Aortic root replacement for bicuspid aortopathy following heart transplantation. Although donors with well-functioning bicuspid aortic valves (BAV) are not a contraindication for transplantation, BAV patients are at risk for long-term aortopathy and valve dysfunction. We report a case of a patient status-post heart transplant 13 years ago who presented to our institution with a BAV and severe aortic regurgitation associated with an aortic root aneurysm and underwent aortic root replacement.
