Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in pediatric cardiac transplantation. We reviewed a single institution experience with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the perioperative management of cardiac transplantation. Of all pediatric cardiac transplant candidates (1984-2003), patients requiring ECMO pretransplantation/posttransplantation were identified, with particular attention to use of ECMO as a bridge to transplantation. Parameters reviewed included proportionate survival, incidence of pre-ECMO cardiac arrest, ECMO duration, and United Network for Organ Sharing list time. Three hundred patients were listed for transplantation. Twenty-nine required ECMO: 18 pretransplant, 3 pretransplant and posttransplant, 6 posttransplant, and 2 for delayed acute rejection. There were 21 bridge-to-transplant candidates, of which 10 eventually transplanted with 60% survival; 11 not transplanted had no survivors (P = .004). Thirteen of 21 had cardiac arrest pre-ECMO with 1 (8%) survivor; 8 of 21 had no arrest with 5 (63%) survivors (P = .014). Mean ECMO duration and United Network for Organ Sharing list times between transplanted and not transplanted were not significant. Nine received ECMO posttransplantation for cardiopulmonary support; 5 (56%) of 9 survived. Two patients supported with ECMO for rejection-related cardiovascular collapse survived. ECMO can bridge children to cardiac transplantation. Survival is significantly impaired in bridge-to-transplant candidates stratified by pre-ECMO cardiac arrest. ECMO can also help transition from cardiopulmonary bypass after transplantation and provide effective support during acute rejection.
