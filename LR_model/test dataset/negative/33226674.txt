Radiofrequency ablation of supraventricular arrhythmias after orthotopic heart transplantation: Long-term follow-up of a single-center experience. Supraventricular arrhythmias (SVAs), commonly managed with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), may occur after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). We retrospectively assessed 514 consecutive patients (pts.) undergoing OHT between January 1990 and July 2016 in a single-center. Patients with SVAs managed with RFA were included. Mechanisms of genesis of SVAs, association with surgical techniques and outcomes, were analyzed. Of 514 pts undergoing OHT, 53% (272 pts.) were managed with bicaval (BC) technique and 47% (242 pts.) with biatrial (BA) technique. Mean follow-up 10 ± 8.4 years. Nine pts. (1.7%) developed SVA requiring RFA. The BC technique was performed in 4 pts., 3 pts. presented cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter (CTI AFL), and 1 pt. double loop AFL. Five pts. were managed with BA technique, 4 pts. presented CTI AFL, and 1 pt. atrial tachycardia (AT). Mean time between OHT and SVA occurrence was 6.6 ± 5.5 years. The procedure was successful in 89% (8 pts.). Arrhythmia recurrence was seen in 3 pts (37%), all with BA technique. Supraventricular arrhythmias in heart transplantation may be associated with the surgical scar. Identifying the mechanism is vital to choose the appropriate treatment with radiofrequency ablation.
