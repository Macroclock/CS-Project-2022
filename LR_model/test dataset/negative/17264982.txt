Rat chemokine CXCL11: structure, tissue distribution, function and expression in cardiac transplantation models. CXCL11 is thought to play a critical role in allograft rejection. To clarify the role of CXCL11 in the rat transplantation model, we cloned CXCL11 cDNA from rat liver tissue and used it to study CXCL11 structure, function and expression. The rat CXCL11 gene encodes a protein of 100 amino acids and spans approximately a 2.8 kb DNA segment containing 4 exons in the protein coding region. Tissue distribution of rat CXCL11 was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR and showed that rat CXCL11 mRNA is expressed in various tissues and, in particular, at high levels in the spleen and lymph nodes. COS-1 cells were transfected with a plasmid vector encoding rat CXCL11 and used to study CXCL11 effects on cell migration and internalization of CXCR3, the CXCL11 receptor. The recombinant CXCL11 showed chemotactic properties and induced CXCR3 internalization in CD4(+) T cells. Expression of CXCL11 mRNA also was measured in rat acute (ACI to LEW) and chronic (LEW to F344) heart transplant rejection models. CXCL11 mRNA expression in allografts increased in both models, compared with controls, and was primarily observed in infiltrating macrophages and donor endothelial cells. These results indicate that, like the other CXCR3 chemokines, rat CXCL11 seems to have a role in the homing of CD4(+) T cells in both acute and chronic rejection models of heart allotransplantation.
