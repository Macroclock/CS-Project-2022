Alteration of innate immunity by donor IL-6 deficiency in a presensitized heart transplant model. Engraftment of IL-6 deficient donor into wild-type recipient could significantly improve allograft survival through T cell lineage particularly regulatory T cells (Tregs) in non-sensitized transplant host. However, its effect on innate immune responses remains uncertain. Our data revealed that donor IL-6 deficiency significantly increased infiltration of two subsets of MDSCs (CD11b+Gr1+myeloid-derived suppressor cells), CD11b+Gr1(-low) and CD11b+Gr1(-int) with strong immunosuppression activity in the transplanted graft. It resulted in a dramatic increase of CD11b+Gr1(-low) frequency and a significant decrease of the frequency of CD11b+Gr1(-high) and CD4-CD8-NK1.1+ cells in the recipient's spleen. Unexpectedly, donor IL-6 deficiency could not significantly reduce macrophage frequency irrespective of in the host's spleen or graft. Taken together, suppression of innate immune effector cells and enhanced activity of regulatory MDSCs contributed to tolerance induction by blockade of IL-6 signaling pathway. The unveiled novel mechanism of targeting IL-6 might shed light on clinical therapeutic application in preventing accelerated allograft rejection for those pre-sensitized transplant recipients.
