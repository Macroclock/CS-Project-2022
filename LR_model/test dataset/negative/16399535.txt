Static and dynamic predictors of adverse events in patients with intermediate cardiopulmonary capacity referred for heart transplantation. Chronic heart failure (CHF) patients with intermediate cardiopulmonary capacity referred for heart transplantation are at "medium risk," and are not amenable to further stratification based solely on peak VO(2.) Accordingly, we analyzed whether time-related and/or non-time-related parameters could provide incremental prognostic information in CHF patients with intermediate cardiopulmonary capacity. We analyzed 134 patients with a peak VO(2) of 10 to 18 ml/kg/min (age 54 +/- 9 years, 66% males) and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 27% +/- 8% who underwent an extensive clinical/instrumental (electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, cardiopulmonary exercise test) index evaluation; for all patients, an equivalent pre-study evaluation (performed >or=6 months before) was also available. Among index-evaluation parameters, systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), LVEF (p = 0.036), and presence of severe mitral regurgitation (p = 0.006) independently predicted cardiac death/need for heart transplantation. Stable clinical condition from pre-study to index-evaluation accompanied by <10% QRS widening and <10% decrease in peak VO(2) provided incremental prognostic information with respect to all index-evaluation parameters (p = 0.014). CHF patients with intermediate peak VO(2) who display "stable" CHF present a lower incidence of adverse cardiac events, particularly in the absence of hypotension, severe mitral regurgitation, and severe reduction of LVEF. Such a stratification might be clinically useful for deciding between medical treatment alone and consideration for heart transplantation.
