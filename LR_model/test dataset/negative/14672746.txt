Short- and long-term outcomes of combined cardiac and renal transplantation with allografts from a single donor. Coexisting end-stage heart and kidney failure can be treated by combined cardiac and renal transplantation. This study reviews the short- and long-term outcomes after such a procedure over a 16-year period at a single institution. All patients who underwent single-donor simultaneous heart and kidney transplantation during the period of March 1986 to April 2002 (including heart retransplantation) were included (n = 13). They were listed for combined heart and kidney transplantation as they fulfilled our criteria for irreversible end-stage organ failure. Retrospective review of patient data from the transplant database, patient case notes and post-mortem reports were carried out. The mean (SD) recipient age was 45 (12) years and there were 2 females. The mean pre-operative creatinine level was 724 (415) micromol/liter with 9 patients (69.2%) on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and 2 patients (15.4%) on hemodialysis prior to transplantation. The 30-day mortality rate was 15.4% (2 of 13). For surviving patients the mean creatinine level at hospital discharge was 158 (93) micromol/liter. The mean number of acute cardiac rejection episodes per 100 patient-days was significantly lower (p = 0.01) than that for the heart-only transplant group (n = 760) during the same period. The median (interquartile range) post-operative survival was 1,969 (620 to 3,468) days. The actuarial survival rates (95% confidence interval) at 1 and 10 years were 77% (54% to 100%) and 67% (40% to 94%), respectively, and were not significantly different from the isolated heart transplant population (p = 0.68). Only 1 episode of acute renal rejection was diagnosed on clinical grounds, which was treated accordingly. There was no renal allograft loss in the long-term survivors. Combined cardiac and renal transplantation with allografts from the same donor has acceptable short- and long-term outcomes for patients with coexisting end-stage cardiac and renal failure. This group of patients may also experience fewer acute rejection episodes post-operatively.
