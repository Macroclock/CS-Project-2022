Sequential measurement of Trypanosoma cruzi parasitic load in endomyocardial biopsies for early detection and follow-up of Chagas disease reactivation after heart transplantation. Reactivation of Chagas disease after heart transplantation is characterized by proliferation and dissemination of Trypanosoma cruzi parasites to several organs. Reactivation affecting the allograft can simulate acute cellular rejection, from which it should be distinguished through the analysis of endomyocardial biopsies (EMB). We evaluated retrospectively 100 EMB collected in the first year of follow-up from 13 heart-transplanted, chagasic patients who presented reactivation and were successfully treated. Additionally, 37 EMB from 8 patients who did not present reactivation constituted the control group. We reviewed histopathology and performed a real-time PCR-based assay in order to evaluate the T cruzi parasitic load of each EMB. The parasitic load of the EMB at the time of reactivation ranged from 22.80 to 190 000/10 Sequential measurement of T cruzi parasitic load in EMB is useful for monitoring Chagas disease reactivation after heart transplantation. Its increase suggests imminent reactivation and its decrease after treatment indicates favorable evolution for cure of the episode of reactivation.
