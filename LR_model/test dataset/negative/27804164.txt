Repair of ascending aortic aneurysms following cardiac transplantation. Ascending aortic aneurysms arising from the native aorta following cardiac transplantation are rare. We report two patients who developed aneurysms of the native ascending aorta requiring surgical repair post-transplantation. Both patients underwent ascending and hemi-arch replacement and recovered uneventfully. Heart transplant patients with pre-existing aortic dilation/ectasia may display more rapid aneurysmal growth compared to non-transplant patients. Therefore close observation is warranted in these patients.
