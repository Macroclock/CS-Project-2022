Hyperlipidemia Promotes Anti-Donor Th17 Responses That Accelerate Allograft Rejection. Hyperlipidemia occurs in 95% of organ transplant recipients, however its effect on organ allograft rejection has not been investigated. We found that induction of hyperlipidemia in mice caused a significant acceleration of rejection of cardiac allografts. Accelerated rejection was associated with an aggressive T cell infiltrate that mediated significant tissue damage as well as increased serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-2, IL-6, and IL-17. Hyperlipidemic mice had an increased number of Th17 cells in their periphery and rejecting allografts from hyperlipidemic mice contained significant numbers of IL-17 producing T cells that were not detectable in transplants harvested from controls. Neutralization or genetic ablation of IL-17 prolonged survival of cardiac allografts transplanted into hyperlipidemic recipients, suggesting that IL-17 production promotes accelerated rejection. Analysis of alloreactive T cell frequencies directly ex vivo in na√Øve mice revealed that the frequency of donor reactive IL-17 producing cells in hyperlipidemic was increased prior to antigen exposure, suggesting that hyperlipidemia was sufficient to alter T cell alloreactivity and promote anti-donor Th17 responses on first exposure to antigen. Together, our data suggest that hyperlipidemia alters rejection by altering the types of T cell subsets that respond to donor antigen by promoting Th17 biased anti-donor reactivity.
