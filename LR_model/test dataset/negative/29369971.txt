mTOR Inhibition and Clinical Transplantation: Heart. This brief overview discusses recent data on the use of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in heart transplantation. Trials on de novo use have shown good efficacy of mTOR inhibitors; however, adverse events are often seen. Conversion protocols in long-term patients are mainly used in patients with renal insufficiency. Calcineurin inhibitor minimization and conversion to calcineurin inhibitor-free protocols have proven to stabilize renal function in recent trials. Lastly, beneficial effects of mTORs against the development of graft vasculopathy, cytomeglovirus infection and malignancy have been shown. Nevertheless, lower tolerability of the drug has affected the long-term use in patients. Future consideration of using mTORs will be individualized protocols in special subpopulation after heart transplantation.
