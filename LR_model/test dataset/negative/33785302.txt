Mechanical Circulatory Support Prior to Heart Transplantation Predicts Early Post-Operative Stroke. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices are often deployed to treat patients with refractory cardiogenic shock, rapid deterioration of heart failure, and inotrope-dependent patients. Stroke is a common complication of MCS therapy. This study assesses the risk of stroke during the early post-heart transplantation (HT) period (days from successful HT to discharge or death) in patients who received MCS therapy leading to HT. Data were derived from the United Organ Sharing (UNOS) database. MCS modalities studied include left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), right ventricular assist devices (RVAD), biventricular ventricular assist devices (BiVAD), and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). A multiple logistic regression model was used to determine the risk of stroke during the early post-HT period associated in patients treated with MCS leading to HT. Between 1988 and 2014, 10,258 patients received MCS therapy leading to HT. Of these, 160 patients (1.96%) developed stroke during the early post-HT period. Multiple regression analysis showed that MCS modalities and associated odds ratios for early post-HT stroke and associated 95% confidence intervals were as follows: LVAD (1.44, 0.70-2.94), RVAD (2.89, 1.03-8.05, BiVAD (3.24, 1.15-9.10), ECMO (2.27 (1.17-4.40), and any MCS (1.60 (1.20-2.12). With the exception of left ventricular assist devices, use of MCS modalities leading to HT is significantly and independently associated with stroke during the early post-HT period.
