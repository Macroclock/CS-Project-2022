Mechanical circulatory support in paediatric population. Extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation is a life-saving modality to support the cardiac and/or pulmonary system as a form of life support in resuscitation, post-cardiotomy, as a bridge to cardiac transplantation and in respiratory failure. Its use in the paediatric and neonatal population has proven incredibly useful. However, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation is also associated with a greater rate of mortality and complications, particularly in those with co-morbidities. As a result, interventions such as ventricular assist devices have been trialled in these patients. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current literature on extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation for cardiac support in the paediatric and neonatal population. We evaluate its effectiveness in comparison to other forms of mechanical circulatory support and focus on areas for future development.
