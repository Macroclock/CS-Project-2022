Endogenous memory T cells with donor-reactivity: early post-transplant mediators of acute graft injury in unsensitized recipients. The pretransplant presence of endogenous donor-reactive memory T cells is an established risk factor for acute rejection and poorer transplant outcomes. A major source of these memory T cells in unsensitized recipients is heterologously generated memory T cells expressing reactivity to donor allogeneic MHC molecules. Multiple clinical studies have shown that the pretransplant presence of high numbers of circulating endogenous donor-reactive memory T cells correlates with higher incidence of acute rejection and decreased graft function during the first-year post-transplant. These findings have spurred investigation in preclinical models to better understand mechanisms underlying endogenous donor-reactive memory T-cell-mediated allograft injury in unsensitized graft recipients. These studies have led to the identification of unique mechanisms underlying the activation of these memory T cells within allografts at early times after transplant. In particular, optimal activation to mediate acute allograft injury is dependent on the intensity of ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Therapeutic strategies directed at the recruitment and activation of endogenous donor-reactive memory T cells are effective in attenuating acute injury in allografts experiencing increased ischaemia-reperfusion injury in preclinical models and should be translatable to clinical transplantation.
