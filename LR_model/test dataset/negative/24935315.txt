Outcomes in patients receiving HeartMate II versus HVAD left ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplantation. Ventricular assist devices have become a standard treatment for patients with advanced heart failure. We present data comparing results after implantation of HeartMate II (HM II) versus HVAD (HW) left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) for the past 7 years at our institution. From July 2006 to August 2012, 121 consecutive patients underwent LVAD implantation: 70 (57.9%) received HM II and 51 (42.1%) HW. Patient demographics, perioperative characteristics, and laboratory parameters as well as postoperative outcome were compared retrospectively. Patients in the HM II group were significantly younger (P < .01), with more deranged liver function (higher bilirubin [P = .02] and alanine aminotransferase [P = .01] levels), and had a significantly higher rate of preoperative infections requiring antibiotic treatment (P = .02) and a higher body core temperature (P < .01). Other demographic and preoperative parameters did not show statistical differences. Most postoperative characteristics were also similar between the two groups. HM II patients had a significantly higher transfusion rate, but there were no differences in incidence of resternotomy (P = .156). Recovery and VAD explantation were more likely in the HM II group (P = .02). Although there was no significant difference in survival (log rank test: P = .986; Breslow test: P = .827), HM II patients were more likely to develop a percutaneous site infection (P = .01). Both HM II and HW provide similar early postoperative outcome and good long-term survival. The differences observed between the groups may be related to demographic and preoperative factors rather than the type of the device used.
