Nesiritide use for critically ill children awaiting cardiac transplantation. This study aimed to explore the effects of nesiritide in children awaiting cardiac transplantation. At the discretion of the attending physician, nesiritide was added to standard therapy for seven children (median age, 11 months) and continued until clinical improvement or transplantation. Blood pressure and urine output data were compared with data from the day before nesiritide institution. Safety parameters were assessed throughout the study. Urine output increased from 2.6 to 3.6 ml/kg/h (p = 0.04). No significant blood pressure changes or adverse effects related to nesiritide were noted. Nesiritide may be safe and effective for children with severe heart failure.
