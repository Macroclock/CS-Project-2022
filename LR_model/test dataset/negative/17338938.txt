Pulmonary hypertension associated with left-sided heart disease. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) denotes a poor prognosis in patients with left-sided heart disease. No study has demonstrated long-term benefit from PH drugs such as prostanoids, endothelin antagonists, and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. In some cases, cautious use of PH drugs may be indicated. However, theoretic and practical concerns limit any formal recommendations.
