Cholinesterase levels predict exercise capacity in cardiac recipients early after transplantation. Although cardiac rehabilitation is recommended for patients early after heart transplantation (HTx), adequate exercise effect cannot always be obtained, partly because in patients with chronic heart failure, exercise capacity is reduced due to malnutrition while waiting for HTx. This study aimed to investigate the relationships between exercise capacity and clinical variables, including nutritional indicators, early after HTx. Forty-three HTx recipients were studied. The mean age at HTx was 38 ± 14 years, and 86% were male. We assessed the relationships between peak oxygen uptake (VO Peak VO Cholinesterase levels predicted exercise capacity early after HTx.
