Altered distribution of H60 minor H antigen-specific CD8 T cells and attenuated chronic vasculopathy in minor histocompatibility antigen mismatched heart transplantation in Cxcr3-/- mouse recipients. Chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions and the subsequent recruitment of T lymphocytes to the graft are believed to be among the initial events in the development of acute and chronic rejection of heart transplants. We sought to determine the role of chemokine receptor Cxcr3 on the development of acute and chronic rejection in a multiple minor Ag mismatched mouse heart transplant model. The frequencies and kinetics of immunodominant H60 (LTFNYRNL) miHA-specific CD8 T cells in wild-type or Cxcr3-/- C57BL/6 recipients were monitored using MHC class I tetramer after BALB/b donor hearts were transplanted. Acceptance of grafts, severity of rejection, and infiltration of T cells were not altered in Cxcr3-/- recipients. However, graft survival was moderately prolonged in Cxcr3-/- recipient mice undergoing acute rejection. Analyses of splenocytes, PBLs, and graft-infiltrating cells revealed increased alloreactive T cells (H60-specific CD8 T cells) in the peripheral blood and spleen but not in the graft. Adoptively transferred Cxcr3-/- CD8 T cells in the BALB/b heart-bearing B6 scid mice showed retention of alloreactive CD8 T cells in the blood but less infiltration into the graft. Cxcr3-/- recipients with long-term graft survival also showed a marked decrease of CD8+ T cell infiltration and reduced neo-intimal hyperplasia. These data indicate that Cxcr3 plays a critical role in the trafficking as well as activation of alloreactive T cells. This role is most eminent in a transplant model when a less complex inflammatory milieu is involved such as a well-matched graft and chronic rejection.
