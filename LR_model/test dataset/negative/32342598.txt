B cell-derived IL-1β and IL-6 drive T cell reconstitution following lymphoablation. Understanding the mechanisms of T cell homeostatic expansion is crucial for clinical applications of lymphoablative therapies. We previously established that T cell recovery in mouse heart allograft recipients treated with anti-thymocyte globulin (mATG) critically depends on B cells and is mediated by B cell-derived soluble factors. B cell production of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 is markedly upregulated after heart allotransplantation and lymphoablation. Neutralizing IL-1β or IL-6 with mAb or the use of recipients lacking mature IL-1β, IL-6, IL-1R, MyD88, or IL-6R impair CD4 'B cell biology', 'T cell biology', 'basic (laboratory) research/science', 'cytokines/cytokine receptors', 'immunobiology', 'immunosuppression/immune modulation', 'lymphocyte biology'
