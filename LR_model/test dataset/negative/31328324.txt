Regional abnormalities on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and arrhythmic events in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis. Patients with cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) may present with arrhythmic events (AE): atrioventricular block (AVB) and/ or ventricular arrhythmias (VA). We sought to: (a) use regional analysis of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) to describe anatomic and functional phenotypes of patients with CS and AE; (b) Assess the association of regional CMR abnormalities with the combined endpoint of death, heart transplantation (HT) and AE; and (c) use machine learning (ML) to predict the combined endpoint based on CMR features. we included 76 patients with CS and CMR. We analyzed cine images to determine regional longitudinal (LS) and radial strain (RS); and late gadolinium enhancement imaging to determine regional scar burden (%scar). Patients with AVB (n = 7), compared with those without, had higher %scar in the anterior (21.8 ± 27.4 vs 5.1 ± 8.9; P = 0.0005) and anteroseptal (19.3 ± 24.5 vs 3.5 ± 5.5; P < .0001) walls. Patients with VA (n = 12), compared with those without, had higher %scar in the basal inferoseptum (20.4 ± 30.8 vs 8.3 ± 13.4; P = .03). During mean follow-up of 4.4 ± 3.3 years, four patients died or underwent HT; eight had VA; and zero developed AVB. Multiple regional abnormalities were associated with the combined endpoint, including scar in the anteroseptal wall (HR 1.06 [1.02-1.09] per 1%scar increase, P = .002). The ML algorithm predicted the combined endpoint with a C-statistic of 0.91. Regional CMR abnormalities are associated with AE in patients with CS.
