Late steroid withdrawal after heart transplantation and incidence of acute rejection. Steroid withdrawal (SW) after heart transplantation (HT) reduces steroid-associated side effects, although it can increase acute rejection episodes (ARE). Patient selection criteria for SW and the time elapsed after HT for this maneuver are controversial issues. The objective of this study was to assess the safety of late SW after HT with regard to the occurrence of ARE and to analyze risk factors resulting in a poor evolution. We studied a cohort of 24 patients who underwent SW late after HT. All of them had gone at least 4 years without any ARE. Independent variables were time after HT, general recipient and donor data, risk factors for ARE, and immunosuppression. The dependent variables were occurrence of ARE (proven or not proven with endomyocardial biopsy) and time and severity of ARE. Among 24 HT patients including 96% men with an overall mean age of 57 years who underwent SW, the mean follow-up was 2.32 +/- 0.86 years. Six patients (25%) displayed an ARE >or=2R according to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) at 5 +/- 3 months after SW. There were no deaths. Time from the last rejection episode to SW was 6.6 +/- 2 years. All ARE were treated with steroid boluses (mean total dose 1583 +/- 1044 mg). Among the HT patients with ARE, 5 (85%) had never experienced ARE after HT. Upon long-term follow-up, there were 2 deaths: 1 sudden death at 30 months after SW and 1 due to allograft vasculopathy at 20 months post-SW. Currently 92% are New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 67% +/- 10%. In our series of HT with late SW after HT (even among an HT population with a low risk of rejection), there was a 25% rate of ARE. This study did not allow us to identify risk factors for ARE after SW. We believe that based upon these observations SW should be implemented with caution.
