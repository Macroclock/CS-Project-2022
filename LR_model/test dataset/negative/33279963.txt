Association Between Lymphopenia at 1 Month Posttransplant and Infectious Outcomes or Death in Heart Transplant Recipients. Cell-mediated immunity is a specific target of several medications used to prevent or treat rejection in orthotopic heart transplantation. Low absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) has potential to be a useful and accessible clinical indicator of overall infection risk. Though some studies have demonstrated this association in other transplant populations, it has not been assessed in heart transplant recipients. A single-center retrospective cohort study examined adult heart transplant recipients transplanted between 2000 and 2018. The exposure of interest was ALC ≤0.75 × 103 cells/µL at 1 month posttransplant, and the primary endpoint was a composite outcome of infection (including cytomegalovirus [CMV], herpes simplex I/II or varicella zoster virus [HSV/VZV], bloodstream infection [BSI], invasive fungal infection [IFI]) or death occurring after 1 month and before 1 year posttransplant. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was created to control for confounders identified using clinical judgment and statistical criteria. Of 375 subjects analyzed, 101 (27%) developed the composite outcome (61 CMV, 3 HSV/VZV, 19 BSI, 10 IFI, 8 deaths). Lymphopenia (ALC ≤0.75 × 103 cells/µL) at 1 month was associated with a >2-fold higher rate of the composite outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 2.26 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.47-3.46]; P < .001) compared to patients without lymphopenia at 1 month. After adjustment for confounding variables, the presence of lymphopenia remained statistically significantly associated with the composite outcome (HR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.08-2.75]; P = .02). ALC measured at 1 month after heart transplant is associated with an increased risk of infectious outcomes or death in the ensuing 11 months. This is a simple, accessible laboratory measure.
