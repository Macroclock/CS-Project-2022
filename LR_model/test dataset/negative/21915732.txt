[Malassezia folliculitis in an immunocompromised patient]. Malassezia folliculitis (synonym: Pityrosporum folliculitis) is a polymorphic dermatomycosis characterized by the development of small papules and pustules. In severe cases, molluscoid comedonal papules are typical. The disease occurs mainly in sebum-rich areas of the face, back and chest, frequently affecting patients under immunosuppressive therapy. We report a case of Malassezia folliculitis observed in a heart transplant recipient who was successfully treated with itraconazole. Moreover, we summarize the taxonomy of the genus Malassezia as well as diagnostic and therapeutic measures of the related folliculitis.
