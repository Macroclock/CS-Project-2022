Neonatal heart transplantation to a physiologic single lung. Heart transplantation to a physiologic single lung in patients with congenital heart disease is associated with good outcome in teenagers and young adults, but its clinical feasibility has not been reported in neonates and young infants. We describe the clinical and hemodynamic course in a neonate with hypoplastic left heart syndrome who underwent primary heart transplantation to a single functioning right lung.
