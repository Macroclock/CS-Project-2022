European results with a continuous-flow ventricular assist device for advanced heart-failure patients. The HeartMate II (HM II) LVAD is a small, quiet, continuous-flow, left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for circulatory support in advanced heart-failure patients, with over 2000 implants worldwide. This article reports on the European experience with this device. The HM II was implanted in 571 patients at 64 European institutions. In 72% of cases (411 patients), implantation has taken place at least 6 months before the closing date of the study (1 August 2008). Patients (19% female, 70% ischaemic aetiology) were on maximum medical therapy, including inotropic support. Body surface area ranged from 1.30 to 2.50 m(2) and age from 14 to 75 years (mean: 51+/-14 years; n=115, 28% over age 60 years). The intention of support was to provide a bridge to transplantation (73%), destination therapy (21%) and a bridge to recovery (6%). Adverse events were documented in the first 53 patients - for obtaining the Conformité Européenne (CE) Mark (group A) - from a European multicentric study (Strüber et al. [Strüber M, Sander K, Lahpor J, Ahn H, Litzler P-Y, Drakos SG, Musumeci F, Schlensak C, Friedrich I, Gustafsson R, Oertel F, Leprince P. HeartMate II left ventricular assist device; early European experience. Eur J Cardiovasc Surg 2008;34(2):289-94.]: 101 patients) and from a single-centre study (UMCU, The Netherlands: 30 patients). The mean support duration ranged from 0 to 1019 days with a mean of 236+/-214 days (249 patients: >6 months, 119: 1 year, 12: >2 years; total support time: 293 years). The overall survival to transplantation, recovery or ongoing device support at the end of the study was 69% (284) with an early mortality of 17.5% and late mortality of 13.5%. Of the surviving patients, 23% have been transplanted, 4% had their device removed after recovery of the left ventricle and 42% are still ongoing. Adverse events included bleeding (ranging from 42% in group C to 59% in group A), percutaneous lead infections (A: 0.19, B: 0.61 and C: 0.18 events per patient year), pocket infections (A: 0.08, B: 0.07 and C: 0.09 events per patient year), ischaemic stroke (A: 0.06, B: 0.09 and C: 0.04 events per patient year), haemorrhagic stroke (B: 0.07, C: 0.04 events per patient year) and transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs; A: 0.08, B: 0.02 and C: 0.13 events per patient year). These results support the use of the HM II continuous-flow LVAD for long-term support as a bridge to transplantation and possibly for destination therapy. Future emphasis should focus on minimising adverse events such as infections, bleeding and neurological events.
