Impaired cholesterol efflux capacity and vasculoprotective function of high-density lipoprotein in heart transplant recipients. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism is significantly altered in heart transplant recipients. We hypothesized that HDL function may be impaired in these patients. Fifty-two patients undergoing coronary angiography between 5 and 15 years after heart transplantation were recruited in this cross-sectional study. Cholesterol efflux capacity of apolipoprotein B-depleted plasma was analyzed using a validated assay. The vasculoprotective function of HDL was studied by means of an endothelial progenitor cell migration assay. HDL cholesterol levels were similar in heart transplant patients compared with healthy controls. However, normalized cholesterol efflux and vasculoprotective function were reduced by 24.1% (p < 0.001) and 27.0% (p < 0.01), respectively, in heart transplant recipients compared with healthy controls. HDL function was similar in patients with and without cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) and was not related to C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. An interaction effect (p = 0.0584) was observed between etiology of heart failure before transplantation and steroid use as factors of HDL cholesterol levels. Lower HDL cholesterol levels occurred in patients with prior ischemic cardiomyopathy who were not taking steroids. However, HDL function was independent of the etiology of heart failure before transplantation and steroid use. The percentage of patients with a CRP level ≥6 mg/liter was 3.92-fold (p < 0.01) higher in patients with CAV than in patients without CAV. HDL function is impaired in heart transplant recipients, but it is unrelated to CAV status. The proportion of patients with a CRP level ≥6 mg/liter is prominently higher in CAV-positive patients.
