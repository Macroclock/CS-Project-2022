Endoscopic balloon dilation in duodenal stenosis secondary to intestinal lymphoma in a heart transplant patient. Intestinal lymphoma can appear as a result of a state of immunosuppression, secondary to the transplantation of solid organs. Treatment with chemotherapy can result in various complications such as intestinal stenosis due to fibrotic scar tissue, which is a complication barely described in the literature. We present the case of a 12-year-old male with a heart transplant, who was diagnosed with intestinal lymphoma. After chemotherapy treatment, he developed 1-2 daily vomiting episodes as a result of intestinal stenosis due to fibrosis without tumor infiltration. Endoscopic balloon dilation was used and the symptoms were resolved without the need for surgical treatment.
