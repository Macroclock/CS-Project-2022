A new heart: somatic stem cells and myocardial regeneration. End-stage heart failure is a global scourge. Current therapies merely delay its inexorable progression. Heart transplantation is resource-intensive and limited by organ availability. Bone marrow-derived and cardiac-specific stem cells have demonstrated potential for cardiac regeneration and repair, but the magnitude and durability of these promising findings are inconsistent. The purpose of this review is to (1) describe cells currently being investigated, (2) outline the status of current trials, and (3) discuss key objectives of future research.
