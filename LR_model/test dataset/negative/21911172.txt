Successful combined heart-bilateral lung-kidney transplantation from a same donor to treat severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with secondary pulmonary hypertension and renal failure: case report and review of the literature. This study describes the first reported case of a combined heart-lung-kidney transplantation. Our patient suffered from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to long-standing hypertension with Dana Point Classification Group 2 pulmonary hypertension from the underlying cardiac disease, along with renal failure necessitating renal replacement therapy. Twenty months after the transplant procedure, she has stable pulmonary and renal function, plus has resumed a normal daily life with improving exercise tolerance. We propose that a combined heart-lung-kidney transplantation may be an acceptable therapeutic option for carefully selected patients with advanced, concomitant cardiac, pulmonary, and kidney disease.
