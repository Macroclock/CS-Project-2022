Exhaled nitric oxide after lung transplantation: impact of the native lung. It has already been demonstrated that exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) is increased in lung transplant patients with chronic rejection, although it is not known whether the diseased native lung after single lung transplantation (SLTx) contributes to the increased eNO values. This study aimed to compare the eNO values in stable lung transplant patients (SLTx versus sequential (S)SLTx and heart (H)LTx) and in patients with established chronic rejection. Altogether, 42 LTx patients (25 females, 13 SLTx, 18 SSLTx, 11 HLTx), with a mean follow-up of 1149 days and a mean age of 44.6 yrs at transplantation, were included. Twenty-six patients had no signs of chronic rejection (five SLTx and 21 SSLTx/HLTx). There was no difference in their eNO values (10.2 in SLTx versus 12.2 (parts per billion) ppb in SSLTx/HLTx). Sixteen patients (eight SLTx and eight SSLTx/HLTx) had a chronic rejection (eight bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) potential stage, four BOS stage 1, three BOS stage 2 and one BOS stage 3). Their eNOs were 18.1 (SLTx) and 17.0 (SSLTx/HLTx) ppb, respectively, which were significantly different to the stable LTx patients and showed a trend towards significance for SSLTx/HLTx. There was no significant difference in eNO between the patients with chronic rejection who underwent SLTx and those who underwent SSLTx/HLTx. The diseased native lung after single lung transplantation probably does not contribute much to the exhaled nitric oxide values, either in stable lung transplant patients or in lung transplant patients with chronic rejection.
