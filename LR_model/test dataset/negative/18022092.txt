Heart-lung transplantation in a 14-year-old boy with Alström syndrome. We present a 14-year-old boy who suffered from progressive biventricular cardiac failure and secondary pulmonary artery hypertension associated with the rarely seen Alström syndrome. The boy underwent successful heart-lung transplantation. We conclude from this report that heart-lung transplantation in patients with Alström syndrome is a viable therapeutic option in select cases.
