A coordinated approach to improving pediatric heart transplant waitlist outcomes: A summary of the ACTION November 2019 waitlist outcomes committee meeting. The number of children needing heart transplantation continues to rise. Although improvements in heart failure therapy, particularly durable mechanical support, have reduced waitlist mortality, the number of children who die while waiting for a suitable donor organ remains unacceptably high. Roughly, 13% of children and 25% of infants on the heart transplant waitlist will not survive to transplantation. With this in mind, the Advanced Cardiac Therapies Improving Outcomes Collaborative Learning Network (ACTION), through its Waitlist Outcomes Committee, convened a 2-day symposium in Ann Arbor, Michigan, from 2-3 November 2019, to better understand the factors that contribute to pediatric heart transplant waitlist mortality and to focus future efforts on improving the organ allocation rates for children needing heart transplantation. Using improvement science methodology, the heart failure-transplant trajectory was broken down into six key steps, after which modes of failure and opportunities for improvement at each step were discussed. As a result, several projects aimed at reducing waitlist mortality were initiated. 'ACTION', 'heart', 'pediatric', 'quality', 'transplant', 'waitlist'
