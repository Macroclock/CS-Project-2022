Diagnostic and prognostic value of myocardial blood flow quantification as non-invasive indicator of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a leading cause of death in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) survivors. Effective non-invasive screening methods are needed. Our aim was to investigate the added diagnostic and prognostic value of myocardial blood flow (MBF) to standard myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with positron emission tomography (PET) for CAV detection. We studied 94 OHT recipients (prognostic cohort), including 66 who underwent invasive coronary angiography and PET within 1 year (diagnostic cohort). The ISHLT classification was used as standard definition for CAV. Positron emission tomography evaluation included semiquantitative MPI, quantitative MBF (mL/min/g), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). A PET CAV severity score (on a scale of 0-3) was modelled on the ISHLT criteria. Patients were followed for a median of 2.3 years for the occurrence of major adverse events (death, re-transplantation, acute coronary syndrome, and hospitalization for heart failure). Sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value of semiquantitative PET perfusion alone for detecting moderate-severe CAV were 83% [52-98], 82% [69-91], 50% [27-73], and 96% [85-99], respectively {receiver operating characteristic (ROC area: 0.82 [0.70-0.95])}. These values improved to 83% [52-98], 93% [82-98], 71% [42-92], and 96% [97-99], respectively, when LVEF and stress MBF were added (ROC area: 0.88 [0.76-0.99]; P = 0.01). There were 20 major adverse events during follow-up. The annualized event rate was 5%, 9%, and 25% in patients with normal, mildly, and moderate-to-severely abnormal PET CAV grading (P < 0.001), respectively. Multiparametric cardiac PET evaluation including quantification of MBF provides improved detection and gradation of CAV severity over standard myocardial perfusion assessment and is predictive of major adverse events.
