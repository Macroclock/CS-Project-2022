Arteriovenous fistula creation for hypoxia after single ventricle palliation: A single-institution experience and literature review. Hypoxia is a common and sometimes severe morbidity of single ventricle congenital heart disease (CHD). Creation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is occasionally performed for patients after superior or total cavopulmonary connection (SCPC or TCPC) in an attempt to improve oxygen saturations. Despite previous reports, AVF creation is a rare palliation with inadequately defined benefits and risks. We sought to determine changes in peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with a history of single ventricle palliation and history of surgical AVF creation who were seen at our tertiary care center from 1996 to 2017. A total of seven patients were included in our study. SpO Palliative AVF creation for patients with single ventricle CHD and hypoxia does not universally improve SpO 'arteriovenous fistula', 'cavopulmonary connection', 'hepatic factor', 'hypoxia', 'pulmonary arteriovenous malformations', 'single ventricle'
