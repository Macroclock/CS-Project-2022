Reversible myocardial dysfunction after traumatic brain injury: mechanisms and implications for heart transplantation. Reversible myocardial dysfunction is known to occur in patients with cerebrovascular accidents and brain death. Several mechanisms for transient myocardial dysfunction have been proposed, including increased sympathetic activity, hormone depletion, and a reduction in coronary perfusion pressure. The relative importance of each of these mechanisms remains controversial. We report the case of a 19-year-old man who suffered traumatic brain death associated with reversible myocardial dysfunction despite elevated cardiac enzymes. Myocardial recovery occurred after correcting his hemodynamic instability and hypothermia emphasizing the importance of normalization of coronary perfusion pressure and core body temperature. The mechanisms for reversible myocardial dysfunction and their implications for heart transplantation following traumatic brain death are reviewed. A diagnostic strategy is proposed that would allow early recognition of reversible myocardial dysfunction in brain-dead patients.
