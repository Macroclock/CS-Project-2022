Emergent General Surgery Operations in Patients With Left Ventricular Assist Devices. The left ventricle assist device (LVAD) patient population is rapidly expanding. Unique characteristics of these patients complicate the management of noncardiac surgical problems. Emergent general surgery (EGS) intervention is often warranted but remains poorly described. We reviewed EGS consultations in LVAD patients to better understand these patients. During a 12-year period, 301 LVAD patients were reviewed. Demographics, comorbidities, reason for EGS consultation, operative intervention, transplantation, and mortality were analyzed. Wilcoxon, Fisher's exact, and chi-square tests were used for analysis. Statistical significance was  A total of 139 (46.2%) patients required EGS consultation. EGS consultations were older (63 vs 57 years;  EGS consultation is necessary in almost half of all LVAD patients, most commonly for GI bleed. EGD/colonoscopy can be safely used to manage the majority of these consultations; one-third will require surgery. High lactic acid is associated with higher mortality. Additional analysis of this population is required for improving surgical management.
