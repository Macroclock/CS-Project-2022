Survival and quality of life for children with end-stage heart failure who are not candidates for cardiac transplant. Some pediatric patients referred for heart transplant (HTx) are sub-optimal candidates. Their outcomes without HTx are presumed to be dismal, but have not been well described. Knowledge about their outcomes is critical when weighing the risks between a high-risk transplant and "terminal" palliation. We retrospectively reviewed all HTx referrals from January 2005 to July 2013. We excluded those who were listed for HTx, or who were denied HTx due to being "too well," seeking only those who were in need of but not suitable for HTx. End-points included mortality and length of survival. Of 212 referrals, 39 (19%) (age 0 to 19 years, median 3.5 years) were denied HTx for reasons other than being too well. Twenty-eight (72%) had palliated congenital heart disease. Overall mortality during the follow-up period was 38% (n = 15) with a median follow-up time of 195 days (8 to 2,832 days). Ten patients received subsequent cardiac surgery with 1 death (10%) and median follow-up of 2.6 years. Mortality risk was not influenced by age, weight, growth failure, congenital heart disease or single-ventricle physiology. Mechanical ventilation (hazard ratio 6.31, p = 0.001) and inotrope dependence (hazard ratio 4.79, p = 0.006) were associated with the highest risk of mortality. Quality of life was measured with the PedsQL cardiac module and completed by 11 of 16 eligible patients with an overall average score of 70.2 Â± 23.9. An advanced heart failure program can achieve satisfactory results for pediatric patients who are not suitable candidates for HTx. For some children, high-risk palliative surgery can result in better outcome than high-risk HTx. Mortality was related to the degree of heart failure at presentation rather than underlying heart disease.
