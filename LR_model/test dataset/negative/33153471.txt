Galectin-9 is required for endometrial regenerative cells to induce long-term cardiac allograft survival in mice. Endometrial regenerative cells (ERCs), a novel type of mesenchymal-like stem cells, were identified as an attractive candidate for immunoregulation and induction of cardiac allograft tolerance. However, the underlying mechanisms of ERCs in immune regulation still remain largely unclear. The present study is designed to determine whether the expression of Galectin-9 (Gal-9), a soluble tandem-repeat member of the galectin family, is crucial for ERC-based immunomodulation. In this study, we measured Gal-9 expression on ERCs and then co-cultured Gal-9-ERCs, ERCs, and ERCs+lactose (Gal-9 blocker) with activated C57BL/6-derived splenocytes. Furthermore, we performed mouse heart transplantation between BALB/c (H-2 Our data demonstrate that ERCs express Gal-9, and this expression is increased by IFN-Î³ stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, both in vitro and in vivo results show that Gal-9-ERC-mediated therapy significantly suppressed Th1 and Th17 cell response, inhibited CD8 Taken together, these data indicate that Gal-9 is required for ERC-mediated immunomodulation and prevention of allograft rejection.
