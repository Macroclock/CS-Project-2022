Development of B-cell memory in early childhood and the impact on antigen-specific tolerance after heart transplantation. Young children show better survival after heart transplant compared with older individuals and can receive heart transplants safely from ABO-incompatible donors. Children develop immunologic tolerance to donor ABH antigens reflected in persistent absence of specific antibodies. We hypothesized that immature T-independent B-cell response and lack of B-cell memory play a crucial role in tolerance of ABH antigens after ABOi transplants. We determined phenotypes of splenic lymphocytes from adults and children and peripheral blood from ABO-incompatible or ABO-compatible heart transplant recipients and control subjects by flow cytometry. In vitro immune response to T-independent stimulation, erythrocytes, and ABH antigens was assessed using proliferation assays. A predominant role for CD27(+) B cells in T-independent activation was demonstrated; these cells were significantly less frequent in infants than older subjects. Only IgM(+)CD27(+) B cells proliferated in response to non-self erythrocytes. In blood, IgM(+) and switched IgM(-) memory B cells were rare in infants, increasing to near-adult levels in children 5 years old. IgM(+)CD27(+) B cells were significantly fewer in ABO-incompatible transplant recipients than in ABO-compatible recipients. CD27(+) cells play a key role in T-independent B-cell activation. Response to ABH antigens is mediated by IgM(+)CD27(+) B cells, and donor ABO-specific tolerance after ABO-incompatible transplantation in children is facilitated by low prevalence of these cells. The pattern of B-cell memory development is altered after ABO-incompatible transplant. Memory B cells may be quantified to assess eligibility for ABO-incompatible transplant and represent a potential therapeutic target to extend the benefits of the immature immune system to older age groups.
