Echo-guided endomyocardial biopsy in heart transplant recipients. After heart transplantation the effect of immunosuppression is monitored by histopathology of endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). EMB is usually carried out under X-ray guidance. Between January 1998 and March 2003, 1,262 biopsies were collected under echo-guidance in 156 patients. The biopsy access was gained through the internal jugular vein, by the standard catheterization technique. The average time of the procedure was 17 min. Four or five specimens were obtained from each patient, with a success rate of 96%. Complications involved two episodes of partial pneumothorax in one patient, atrial flutter in another and ventricular fibrillation in three patients. Conversion from echo to X-ray guidance was indicated in 11 patients. No case of significant tricuspid regurgitation related to the EMB procedure was recorded. The echo-guided endomyocardial biopsy appears to be a prospective alternative to the conventional approach under X-ray guidance. Its duration is comparable, it eliminates X-ray exposure, enables continuous echocardiographic monitoring and can be performed at the bedside.
