[Mechanisms of transplant vasculopathy]. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is a diffuse, obliterative form of arteriosclerosis that is characterized by the production of a neointima rich in vascular smooth muscle cells that progressively obstructs the lumen. Pathophysiologically, after heart transplantation, alloantigens (e. g. on donor endothelial cells) are presented by antigen presenting cells to the T-cells of the body's immune system. With the appropriate costimulatory signal, this signal pattern generates a differentiated T-cell, B-cell, and inflammatory cell response whereas without the second signal, the immune cells undergo apoptosis. In case of immune cell proliferation and differentiation, a coordinated pattern of cytokine release is initiated. Cells of innate immunity, monocyte-derived macrophages, are involved in this process. The inflammatory response culminates in rolling, sticking, and diapedesis through the coronary vascular endothelium and migration and phenotype switch of medial smooth muscle cells mediated by generation of growth-promoting cytokines.
