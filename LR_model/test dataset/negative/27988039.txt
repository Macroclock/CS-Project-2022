Comparison of Patient Characteristics and Course of Hypertensive Hypokinetic Cardiomyopathy Versus Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy. Hypertensive hypokinetic cardiomyopathy (HHC) is defined by left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction with a history of systemic hypertension as the only possible cause. Although commonly encountered in clinical practice, its characterization and differences with true idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) are lacking. The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical instrumental features and the natural history of HHC. We analyzed the data of 4,191 patients referred to our center for newly diagnosed LV systolic dysfunction from 2005 to 2010. Of them, 310 presented idiopathic LV systolic dysfunction (LV ejection fraction <50%): 136 (44%) had a history of systemic hypertension and were defined HHC. The remaining 174 patients were considered IDC. Compared with patients with IDC, those with HHC were older (63 ± 11 vs 47 ± 14 years, p <0.001), with worse comorbidity profile, higher blood pressure, and increased LV mass. During follow-up, patients with HHC showed earlier and higher proportion of LV reverse remodeling (46% vs 21% at 6 months' follow-up). Moreover, they had a better long-term survival free from cardiovascular death/ventricular assist device/heart transplant/malignant ventricular arrhythmias (5.1 vs 12.6 in HHC and IDC, p = 0.03). Indeed, their mortality was mainly driven by noncardiovascular causes (at 10 years 9.6% vs 1.7% in HHC and IDC, p <0.001). In conclusion, HHC has a high prevalence among patients with "idiopathic" LV dysfunction. The natural history of patients with HHC is characterized by a rapid response to optimal therapy for heart failure, a favorable cardiovascular outcome, and a relevant incidence of noncardiovascular events.
