Early degeneration of two different tricuspid bioprostheses in restrictive cardiomyopathy. Early degeneration of tricuspid bioprostheses is a rare, but extremely serious, complication. Several mechanisms have been described, both for surgically implanted and transcatheter bioprosthesis. We report a case of early degeneration of tricuspid porcine bioprosthesis and a subsequent transcatheter valve-in-valve bovine prosthesis due to severe fibrosis with leaflet retraction in a patient with restrictive cardiomyopathy who finally underwent orthotopic heart transplantation.
