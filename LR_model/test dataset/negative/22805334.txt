Response to hepatitis A and B vaccination after pediatric heart transplant. The determination of optimal immunization protocols for immunocompromised patients is important given limited data, the potential for decreased vaccine response, and the increased threat of infection. This retrospective study assessed the response to HA and/or HB vaccination in a cohort of 13 PHTx recipients. Descriptive statistics were applied to the data, and univariate analysis was utilized to identify possible factors associated with vaccine response. HA vaccination occurred in 12 (92%) patients of whom three (25%) became HA IgG positive post-vaccination. Eight (62%) patients had previously received HB vaccination. HB vaccination occurred in 10 (77%) patients of whom five (50%) were anti-HBS IgG positive post-vaccination. Median age at HA and HB vaccination was 10.0 yr, and median time post-PHTx was 8.2 yr. Looking at the entire patient cohort, a previous history of HB vaccination was associated with increased probability of HB vaccine success (7/8 [88%] vs. 1/5 [20%], p = 0.03). Vaccine response in this cohort of PHTx recipients was well below the rates of healthy children. Only a previous history of HB vaccination was significant for increased likelihood of vaccine response. Further study is needed to identify the optimal approach to vaccination for PHTx recipients.
