JC virus-associated nephropathy in a post-heart and -kidney transplantation patient. JC virus-associated nephropathy is rare in kidney transplant recipients, and even rarer in recipients of other solid organ transplants. We present a case of JC virus-associated nephropathy in a heart-kidney transplant recipient, which to our knowledge is the first case reported in the literature. We discuss the findings on renal biopsy for JC virus nephropathy and our management approach to this rare complication.
