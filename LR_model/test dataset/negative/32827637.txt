Serially Measured Cytokines and Cytokine Receptors in Relation to Clinical Outcome in Patients With Stable Heart Failure. In this prospective cohort study of 250 stable heart failure patients with trimonthly blood sampling, we investigated associations of 17 repeatedly measured cytokines and cytokine receptors with clinical outcome during a median follow-up of 2.2 (25th-75th percentile, 1.4-2.5) years. Sixty-six patients reached the primary end point (composite of cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalization, heart transplantation, left ventricular assist device implantation). Repeatedly measured levels of 8 biomarkers correlated with clinical outcomes independent of clinical characteristics. Rates of change over time (slopes of biomarker evolutions) remained independently associated with outcome for 15 biomarkers. Thus, temporal patterns of cytokines and cytokine receptors, in particular tumour necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 13B and interleukin-1 receptor type 1, might contribute to personalized risk assessment.
