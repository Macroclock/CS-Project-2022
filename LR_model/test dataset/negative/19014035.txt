Dental considerations in the management of the cardiac transplant patient. Every year, more than 25,000 transplantation procedures are performed in the United States to replace solid organs, including the heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, and pancreas. Cardiac transplant patients need specialized dental care. The compromised health and immune systems of these patients place them at increased risk for systemic and oral infections, which must be considered when planning dental treatment before and after cardiac transplantation. This article reviews the current status of dental care practices that have been recommended and presents a rationale that can be applied as the basis of guidelines and recommendations for treating cardiac transplant patients.
