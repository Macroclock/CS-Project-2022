Primary graft dysfunction after heart transplantation: Outcomes and resource utilization. A unified definition of primary graft dysfunction (PGD) after heart transplantation was adopted in 2014, with moderate and severe PGD defined as a need for mechanical circulatory support. While risk factors for PGD are well identified, outcomes and resource utilization have not been well-studied. We examined the resource utilization and associated costs with PGD. All adult heart transplantations (2001-2016) from a statewide Society of Thoracic Surgery database were analyzed by dividing them into two groups-with PGD (requiring mechanical circulatory support) and without PGD. Of the 718 heart transplants, 110 (15.3%) patients developed PGD. Prevalence of PGD for the study duration ranged from 3.7% to 22.7% with no significant trend. The most frequently used mechanical circulatory support device was intra-aortic balloon pump (88%), followed by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (17%), and catheter-based circulatory support devices (3%). There were no significant differences in demographics or preoperative variables between the two groups. Resource utilization such as total intensive care unit hours, ventilation hours, reoperation for bleeding, blood product transfusions, and length of stay were significantly higher in the PGD group. Postoperative complications were also higher in PGD group including operative mortality (31.8% vs 3.8%, P < .0001). The median cost of heart transplantation was significantly higher in the PGD group $229 482 ($126 044-$388 889) vs $101 788 ($72 638-$181 180) P < .0001. Primary graft dysfunction following heart transplantation developed in 15% of patients. Patients with PGD had significantly higher complications, resource utilization, and mortality. Preventive measures to address the development of PGD would reduce resource utilization and improve outcomes. 'heart transplantation', 'mechanical circulatory support', 'primary graft dysfunction'
