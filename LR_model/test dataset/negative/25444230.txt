A decade of cardiac transplantation in Coimbra: the value of experience. To analyze the experience gained in 10 years of the heart transplantation program of the University Hospital of Coimbra. Between November 2003 and December 2013, 258 patients with a mean age of 53.0±12.7 years (3-72 years) and predominantly male (78%) were transplanted. Over a third of patients had ischemic (37.2%) and 36.4% idiopathic cardiomyopathy. The mean age of donors was 34.4±1.3 years and 195 were male (76%), with gender difference between donor and recipient in 32% of cases and ABO disparity (non-identical groups but compatible) in 18%. Harvest was distant in 59% of cases. In all cases total heart transplantation with bicaval anastomoses, modified at this center, was used. Mean ischemia time was 89.7±35.4 minutes. All patients received induction therapy. Early mortality was 4.7% (12 patients) from graft failure and stroke in five patients each, and hyperacute rejection in two. Thirteen patients (5%) required prolonged ventilation, 25 (11.8%) required inotropic support for more than 48 hours, and seven required pacemaker implantation. Mean hospital stay was 15.8±15.3 days (median 12 days). Ninety percent of patients were maintained on triple immunosuppressive therapy including cyclosporine, the remainder receiving tacrolimus. In 23 patients it was necessary to change the immunosuppression protocol due to renal and/or neoplastic complications and humoral rejection. All but two patients have been followed in the Surgical Center. Fifty patients (19.4%) subsequently died from infection (18), cancer (10), vascular (eight), neuropsychiatric (four), cardiac (two) or other causes (eight). Forty-six patients (17.8%) had episodes of cellular rejection (>2 R on the ISHLT classification), eight had humoral rejection (3.1%), and 22 have evidence of graft vascular disease (8.5%). Actuarial survival at 1, 5, and 8 years was 87±2%, 78±3% and 69±4%, respectively. This 10-year series yielded results equivalent or superior to those of centers with wider and longer experience, and have progressively improved following the introduction of changes prompted by experience. This program has made it possible to raise and maintain the rate of heart transplantation to values above the European average.
