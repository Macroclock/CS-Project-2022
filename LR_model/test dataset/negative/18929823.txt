Tuberculosis after heart transplantation: twenty years of experience in a single center in Taiwan. The incidence of tuberculosis is slightly higher among heart transplantation cases than in the general population in Taiwan. Tuberculosis shows a high mortality rate ranging from 22% to 31% in transplant recipients. From October 1987 to October 2007, we performed 315 heart transplantations. Clinical records were reviewed for demographic data, clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome. Tuberculosis was diagnosed by cultures of any body sample in association with compatible symptoms and signs. Mortality was related to tuberculosis if there was evidence of active tuberculosis at the time of death and no other etiology accounted for death. Ten patients who had received heart transplants were diagnosed as tuberculosis. There were seven pulmonary lesions and seven extrapulmonary lesions. Treatment consisted of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, streptomycin, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. Seven patients completed the antituberculosis treatment: the median treatment duration was 1 year. Three patients developed hepatitis. There was no tuberculosis-related mortality. Ten out of a total of 315 patients (3.17%) represented a tuberculosis rate higher than that reported for the general Taiwan population (67/100,000). This high mortality of infection may be completely treated by a combination of at least three drugs except pyrzinamide because of side effects and tolerance.
