Mycobacterium haemophilum infections in heart transplant recipients: case report and review of the literature. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria are becoming increasingly important pathogens among transplant recipients. We report a case of disseminated Mycobacterium haemophilum infection in a heart transplant recipient, manifesting as cellulitis, subcutaneous nodules, septic arthritis, and pneumonitis. Our case illustrates diverse challenges in the identification and treatment of this pathogen, such as its unique culture requirements and variable antimicrobial susceptibilities. Heightened clinical suspicion is necessary to establish a timely diagnosis so that optimal treatment can be administered.
