Delayed contrast enhancement magnetic resonance imaging in congenital aortic stenosis. We report a case of a 12-year-old boy with severe congenital aortic stenosis in whom magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with delayed contrast enhancement demonstrated extensive subendocardial hyperenhancement within the left ventricle. The hyperenhancement was confirmed to be subendocardial infarct and fibrosis by histopathology. This case supports the utility of MRI with delayed contrast enhancement in evaluating myocardial viability in patients with congenital heart disease.
