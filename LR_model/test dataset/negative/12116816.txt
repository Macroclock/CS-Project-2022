[Life style and adherence to the recommended treatments after cardiac transplantation]. All the previous studies showed an increase in survival after cardiac transplantation. Nevertheless, a certain number of patients persist, in the short- and long-term period, in leading an incorrect lifestyle. Owing to this high-risk behavioral profile clinical, psychological and social problems could arise. We have analyzed the quality of life and adherence to the recommended treatments in 107 patients at least 6 months (range 6-132 months) after they had been submitted to heart transplant and returned to their preoperative social and family environments. Data analysis has shown, in these patients, the return to their previous high-risk lifestyle habits: 18.4% of them did not adhere to the suggested diet, 13.2% did not perform physical activity, and 36.7% of the smokers took up the habit again after the transplant. Perceptions of emotional distress were still there: anxiety in 10.3% of cases and depression in 13.1%. An unsatisfactory sexuality was reported by 27.1% and only 27% returned to their previous job. Their outlook towards their self-efficacy seems to be predictive of the quality of life as perceived by the patient after the heart transplant: the better their outlook towards their self-efficacy, the better the quality of life. These data show that following heart transplant, before implementing postoperative preparation and rehabilitation programs one must carefully study those problem areas that unfortunately still exist.
