Early Signs of Sinoatrial Reinnervation in the Transplanted Heart. Heart transplantation (HTx) surgically transects all connections to the heart, including the autonomic nerves. We prospectively examined signs, timing and consequences of early sympathetic and parasympathetic sinoatrial reinnervation, as well as explored indirect evidence of afferent cardiopulmonary reinnervation. Fifty HTx recipients were assessed at 2.5, 6, and 12 mo after HTx. For comparison, 50 healthy controls were examined once. Continuous, noninvasive recordings of hemodynamic variables and heart rate variability indices were performed at supine rest, 0.2 Hz controlled breathing, 60Â° head-up-tilt, during the Valsalva maneuver and during handgrip isometric exercise. In HTx recipients, supine low-frequency heart rate variability gradually increased; supine high-frequency variability did not change; heart rate variability indices during controlled breathing remained unaltered; heart rate responses during tilt and isometric exercise gradually increased; the tachycardia response during Valsalva maneuver increased, while the bradycardia response remained unchanged; and indices of baroreflex sensitivity improved. Responses remained low compared to healthy controls. A negative correlation between indices of preload and heart rate response during head-up tilt emerged at 12 mo. Results suggest that sympathetic reinnervation of the sinoatrial node starts within 6 mo after HTx and strengthens during the first year. No evidence of early parasympathetic reinnervation was found. Indirect signs of afferent reinnervation of cardiopulmonary low-pressure baroreceptors emerged at 12 mo. Better sympathetic sinoatrial control improved heart rate responsiveness to orthostatic challenge and isometric exercise, as well as heart rate buffering of blood pressure fluctuations.
