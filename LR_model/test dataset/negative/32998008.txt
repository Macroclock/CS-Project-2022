Longitudinal Strain and Strain Rate for Estimating Left Ventricular Filling Pressure in Heart Transplant Recipients. Traditional parameters have limited value to estimate left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP) in orthotropic heart transplant (OHT) recipients. We hypothesized that global longitudinal strain (GLS), diastolic, and systolic strain rate (SR) would be depressed in OHT recipients with elevated LVFP and could overcome the limitations of traditional parameters. We studied consecutively OHT patients at the time of endomyocardial biopsies and retrospectively pretransplantation studies conforming to the same protocol. Comprehensive echocardiography with strain measurements was performed. Results were compared with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) obtained from right heart catheterization that was performed just after the echocardiography study. In all, 74 studies were performed in 50 OHT recipients. Mean PWCP was 11.8 ± 4.3 mm Hg (range: 4 to 25 mm Hg). Several parameters, but not left atrial volume index, mitral inflow velocities, annular velocities, and their ratio (E/e'), were different between studies with normal (n = 47) and elevated PCWP (n = 27).
