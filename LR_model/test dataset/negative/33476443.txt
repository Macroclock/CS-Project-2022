Left ventricular assist devices: A comprehensive review of major clinical trials, devices, and future directions. Heart failure is an increasingly prevalent medical condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In spite of optimal medical therapy, a large number of patients continue to deteriorate clinically and could potentially benefit from advanced therapies. While cardiac transplantation is an established therapy for end-stage heart failure, there are a limited number of donor hearts, and many patients may not be candidates. Over the past two decades, mechanical circulatory supportÂ and left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) have altered the heart failure management landscape. Herein we review the indications for LVAD implantation and how they have changed over time. We will also outline major technological evolutions in LVADs and summarize the landmark clinical trials pertaining to them. We also highlight the adverse events associated with LVADs and assess the limitations of the existing literature. Finally, we look ahead to the future of LVAD therapy for patients with advanced heart failure. 'clinical trials', 'heart failure', 'left ventricular assist device', 'mechanical circulatory support'
