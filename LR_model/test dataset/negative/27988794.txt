Teriparatide treatment in a heart transplant patient with a chronic kidney disease and a low-turnover bone disease: a case report. Low-turnover bone disease is a complication of chronic kidney disease and a long-term steroid therapy. Currently, the only bone anabolic treatment available is teriparatide (TPTD). So far, no data exist in heart transplant patients, and only one single case with histomorphometric analysis of a dialysis patient with a low-turnover bone disease has been published. The current report shows the effect of a 1-year TPTD therapy in a cardiac transplant patient with 10 vertebral and 3 peripheral fractures who had developed a chronic kidney failure while receiving triple immunosuppressive therapy. A transiliac bone biopsy following tetracycline labeling was performed prior and after 1Â year of treatment, showing an increase in the bone formation and improvement of the structural indices (20-fold increase of osteoid volume/bone volume, fourfold increase of osteoid surface/bone surface and increases of wall thickness (+15%), trabecular thickness (+9%), and trabecular number (+38%)). Bone mineral density was stable, no new vertebral fractures had occurred, the therapy was well-tolerated, and the patient improved clinically.
