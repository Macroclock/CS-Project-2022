[Current treatment of AL amyloidosis]. Systemic AL amyloidosis is a rare complication of monoclonal gammopathies. Renal manifestations are frequent, mostly characterized by heavy proteinuria, with nephrotic syndrome and renal failure in more than half of the patients at diagnosis. Without treatment, median survival does not exceed 12 months. Amyloid heart disease and diffusion of amyloid deposits are associated with reduced survival. Treatment of systemic AL amyloidosis has been profoundly modified with the introduction of international criteria for the definition of organ involvement and hematologic response, and with the use of sensitive tests for the measurement of serum-free light chain levels. Melphalan plus dexamethasone is now established as the gold standard for first line treatment of systemic AL, with similar efficacy and reduced treatment-related mortality compared to high-dose therapy. Modern chemotherapy regimens, based on the use of novel agents such as bortezomib and lenalidomide, might further improve patient survival.
