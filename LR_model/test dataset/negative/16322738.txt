Sequential use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and the Berlin Heart Left Ventricular Assist Device for 106-day bridge to transplant in a two-year-old child. We describe a 2 year-old girl with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy in whom extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was used for mechanical cardiac assistance. After 4 weeks, ECMO-related complications necessitated change to a Berlin Heart Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD), and she received a successful cardiac transplant after a total of 106 days on mechanical cardiac support.
