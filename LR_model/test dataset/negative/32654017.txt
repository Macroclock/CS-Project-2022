Sleeve Gastrectomy in Patients with Continuous-Flow Left Ventricular Assist Devices: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. A body mass index (BMI) > 35 kg/m An electronic search was performed to identify all relevant studies. After assessment for inclusion and exclusion criteria, eight studies were pooled for systematic review and metaanalysis. Overall, of 59 patients, 22 (37%) underwent simultaneous sleeve gastrectomy with CF-LVAD implantation while 37 (63%) underwent staged sleeve gastrectomy after CF-LVAD. The mean age of patients was 46 years (95% CI: 39-53) with 40% females. Mean BMI at most recent follow-up (33.4 kg/m Both simultaneous and staged bariatric surgeries with CF-LVAD placement have comparable outcomes and significantly reduce BMI. This can allow previously ineligible patients to undergo heart transplantation. 'Bariatric surgery', 'Bridge to transplantation', 'Left ventricular assist device'
