Endocrine disorders after heart transplantation: national cohort study. Endocrine disorders in patients after heart transplantation (HT) remain understudied. We aimed to assess endocrine profiles and management of HT recipients in the early post- transplant period. We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 123 consecutive HT recipients in the Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation Programme between 2009 and 2018. All recipients had per-protocol endocrine follow-up within the first postoperative year. The median time to first post-transplant endocrine follow-up was 3 months (IQR 2-4). We assessed the incidence of vitamin D deficiency, bone mineral density, history of low energy fractures, hypogonadism in male recipients, posttransplant diabetes mellitus, and thyroid and parathyroid function. We enrolled 22 women and 101 men of median age 57 years (IQR 50-63). Post-transplant diabetes mellitus developed in 14 patients (11.4%). 18 of 25 patients (14.6%) with preexisting type 2 diabetes mellitus required intensification of antidiabetic therapy. 38 male patients (40.4%) had hypogonadism. 5 patients (4.6%) were hypothyroid and 10 (9.3%) latent hyperthyroid. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was present in 19 (17.3%), 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency in 64 (54.7%) of patients. Osteoporosis was present in 26 (21.1%), osteopenia in 59 (48.0%) patients. 47 vertebral fractures, 3 hip and 1 humerus fractures occurred in 21 patients. Most of the patients had coincidence of two or three disorders, while less than 5% did not have any endocrine irregularities. All patients received calcium and vitamin D supplements. Forty-six patients (37.4%) were treated with zoledronic acid, 12 (9.8%) with oral bisphosphonates. Two patients were treated with teriparatide. The prevalence of multiple endocrine disorders early after heart transplantation is high. Assessment and management of increased fracture risk and all other potentially affected endocrine axes should be considered as a standard of care in this early period.
