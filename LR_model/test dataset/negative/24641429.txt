HeartMate II left ventricular assist device implantation in patients with advanced hepatic dysfunction. We sought to determine the outcomes for patients with advanced hepatic dysfunction undergoing HeartMate II left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. Between November 1, 2003 and December 1, 2012, we implanted the HeartMate II continuous-flow LVAD in 338 patients, either for bridging to heart transplantation or for destination therapy. Twenty-three of these patients (19 men and 4 women; mean age, 47 ± 16 years) had advanced hepatic dysfunction, as characterized by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) levels five times normal; serum total bilirubin levels three times normal; and/or necessity for a liver biopsy before or during device implantation. Of this group, 17 patients received the LVAD as a bridge to transplantation, and six patients received it for destination therapy. Nine of the 23 patients required either a transjugular or a core liver biopsy during LVAD implantation. Three patients died within the first postoperative month; the 20 surviving patients had significant improvements in their hepatic parameters. The ALT decreased from 238 ± 296 to 27 ± 13 U/L (p = 0.022), AST decreased from 209 ± 199 to 29 ± 8 U/L (p = 0.009), and total bilirubin level decreased from 6.9 ± 6.0 to 0.6 ± 0.1 mg/dL (p = 0.044). The serum albumin level increased from 3.2 ± 0.6 to 4.3 ± 0.3 g/dL (p = 0.003), and creatinine clearance increased from 77.6 ± 35.2 to 110.2 ± 35.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p = 0.101). Continuous-flow LVAD support may significantly improve hepatic function, allowing patients with poor preimplant liver function to become better candidates for heart transplantation.
