Effect of a new immunosuppressant histon deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor FR276457 in a rat cardiac transplant model. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) is a known modulator of gene transcription, and the immunosuppressive activity of HDAC inhibitors has been demonstrated in recent several reports. In this study, the HDAC inhibitor FR276457, a hydroxamic derivative, was found to have a similar inhibitory effect on all mammalian HDACs tested, but no isozyme selectivity. Both FR276457 and tacrolimus exerted an immunosuppressive effect on in vitro rat splenocyte proliferation stimulated with Concanavalin A. Next, the effect of FR276457 on allograft rejection when administered either as a monotherapy or in combination with tacrolimus was investigated in a rat heterotopic cardiac transplant model. Orally administered FR276457 prolonged the median survival times (MST) of the transplanted grafts in the vehicle group from 6 d to 17 or 21 d at doses of 20 or 40 mg/kg, respectively. Histopathological analysis showed the structures of the myocardium were not affected, but interstitial cellular infiltration could not be suppressed completely. Tacrolimus (0.032 mg/kg) prolonged allograft MST to 16 d. FR276457, when combined with tacrolimus, prevented allograft rejection at a dose lower than that of the monotherapy. The combination dose prolonged the MST in the groups treated with 10 and 20 mg/kg to >28 d, and cellular infiltration was suppressed completely. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the oral administration of HDAC inhibitor FR276457 can prevent allograft rejection as a monotherapy, and has additive or synergistic effects when combined with tacrolimus.
