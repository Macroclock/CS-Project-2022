A case of late-onset cytomegalovirus myocarditis in an orthotopic heart transplant recipient; case report and review of the literature. We describe a male patient who presents 2 years posttransplant with cough and dyspnea. A negative pulmonary workup led to an endomyocardial biopsy and the diagnosis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) myocarditis. The patient was treated with ganciclovir and intravenous immunoglobulin. This illustrates a very late presentation of posttransplant CMV myocarditis and the usefulness of myocardial biopsy in diagnosis of CMV carditis.
