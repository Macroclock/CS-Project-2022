Prognostic value of selected echocardiographic, impedance cardiographic, and hemodynamic parameters determined during right heart catheterization in patients qualified for heart transplantation. The aim of the study was to verify prognostic value of selected echocardiographic (UKG), impedance cardiography (ICG), and right heart catheterization (RHC) parameters in systolic heart failure (HF). UKG, ICG, and RHC were performed in 46 patients with chronic HF with ejection fraction <35%. During a 1-year follow-up, composite endpoint (death or hospitalization due to HF exacerbation) was achieved by 23 (50.0%) patients. Analysis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves identified UKG parameters: inferior vena cava diameter on inspiration (IVCinsp) >13 mm [area under curve (AUC), 0.791], right atrial (RA) >5.2 cm (AUC 0.710) and ventricular dimension (RVD) >3.5 cm (AUC 0.717), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) <17 mm (AUC 0.682), and its velocity (S'RV) <6.07 cm/s (AUC 0.716) as unfavorable prognostic factors. RHC parameters: low values of cardiac index (CI < 2.1 L/min; AUC 0.846) and high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP > 24 mmHg; AUC 0.773) turned out to be the most accurate single predictors of worse outcome. Prognostic value of non-invasive parameters was improved due to the use of their composite measures: IVC% × TAPSE (<430%/mm; AUC 0.826), RVSP/TAPSE (>2.4 mmHg/mm; AUC 0.800), IVC% × SBP (>2097% mmHg; AUC 0.826), and RA × IVCinsp/S'RV (>11.8 cm s; AUC 0.839). In conclusion, composite measures based on non-invasive parameters, such as IVC%/TAPSE, RVSP/TAPSE and RA × IVCinsp/S'RV, may provide equally accurate prognosis as the invasive examination. PCWP and CI determined during RHC were the best individual predictors of the composite endpoint. In addition, echocardiographic parameters: RVD, RA, IVC, TAPSE, and S'RV are accurate predictors of the unfavorable outcome.
