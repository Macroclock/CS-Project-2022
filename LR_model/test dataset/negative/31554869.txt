Circulating Sphingosine-1-Phosphate as A Non-Invasive Biomarker of Heart Transplant Rejection. Accumulating evidence has confirmed that the expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) is downregulated in heart failure and cardiac allograft rejection. Although many SERCA2a-related genes and proteins involved in the regulation of myocardial Ca
