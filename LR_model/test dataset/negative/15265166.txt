Long-term renal function in pediatric liver and heart recipients. Long-term survivors of pediatric liver and heart transplantation are at risk for progressive renal dysfunction as a result of chronic exposure to calcineuron inhibitors. This class of drugs causes alterations in renal perfusion that can result in irreversible renal injury including afferent arteriopathy, glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Approximately 3-6% of pediatric liver and heart recipients will develop end stage renal failure. A much larger percentage has chronic renal insufficiency and hypertension. Children with significant renal compromise in the pretransplant period and those with significantly elevated serum creatinine levels during the first post-transplant year may be at the highest risk to develop irreversible renal injury in long-term follow-up. Serum creatinine is a poor screening tool as it rises late in the course when the injury may no longer be reversible. Strategies to minimize long-term exposure to calcineuron inhibitors may reduce the prevalence of renal insufficiency in this vulnerable population.
