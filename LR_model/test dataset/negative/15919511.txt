Effects of noninherited maternal antigens on allotransplant rejection in a transgenic mouse model. We studied the influence of noninherited maternal antigen (NIMA) on allotransplant rejection using a mouse transgenic model. CBK transgenic (CBA [H-2k] expressing K(b) MHC class I transgene) mice were used as donors in heart transplantation experiments. Offspring of BM3.3 (CBA anti-K(b) TCR transgenic) male mice and (CBA x CBK)F1 females were used as NIMA (offspring that did not inherit K(b)) and IMA (offspring that inherited K(b) maternal antigen) recipient mice. Survival of allografts was monitored and the alloimmune response evaluated using an ELISPOT assay. IMA mice accepted CBK heart allografts and displayed no alloresponse to K(b+) cells. In contrast, mice never exposed to K(b) (offspring of BM3.3 males and CBA females) acutely rejected their grafts within 18 days posttransplantation and exhibited potent inflammatory alloresponses to K(b+) cells. NIMA mice displayed prolonged survival of allotransplants (MST >60 days). Although no deletion of anti-K(b) TCR transgenic cells was detected in these mice, they had a marked reduction in the frequency of activated alloreactive T cells producing type 1 (IFN-gamma and IL-2) cytokines and concomitant expansion of type 2 (IL-4) cytokine-secreting cells. Finally, depletion of CD4+ T cells from NIMA mice restored acute rejection of CBK hearts. This study is the first demonstration of the tolerogenic effects of NIMA on alloimmunity and allotransplant rejection in a transgenic model. It is shown that, although the NIMA tolerogenic effect is not due to deletion of alloreactive T cells, it is mediated by CD4+ T cells producing type 2 cytokines.
