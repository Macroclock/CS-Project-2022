Serial measurements of exercise performance in pediatric heart transplant patients using stress echocardiography. Heart transplantation is an increasingly acceptable therapeutic option for children with end-stage and complex congenital heart disease. With advances in surgery, immunosuppression, and follow-up care, functional outcomes need to be evaluated. We report the results of serial exercise testing performed using stress echocardiography in a cohort of pediatric HTP. HTP (n = 7) exercised on a semi-recumbent ergometer to volitional fatigue. Echocardiography-Doppler measurements, HR, and blood pressure were taken at rest and during staged exercise. Results were compared with healthy CON (n = 12). HTP did significantly less work during exercise (940 vs. 1218 J/kg, p < 0.03). Their SVI (33 vs. 49 mL/m(2), p < 0.003), CI (5.16 vs. 9.25 L/min/m(2), p < 0.0005), and HR (162 vs. 185 bpm, p < 0.02) were lower at peak exercise. HTP had a lower SF at peak exercise (48% vs. 52%, p < 0.03) and an abnormal relationship between the MVCFc and ÏƒPS. During follow-up, hemodynamics and left ventricular function remained relatively constant in HTP. HTP are able to exercise safely; however, their exercise tolerance is reduced, and hemodynamics and contractility are diminished. Over time, their hemodynamics and left ventricular function have remained relatively constant.
