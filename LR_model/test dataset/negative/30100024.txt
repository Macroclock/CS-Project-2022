Simvastatin reduces the TLR4-induced inflammatory response in human aortic valve interstitial cells. Calcific aortic stenosis is a chronic inflammatory disease. Proinflammatory stimulation via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) causes the aortic valve interstitial cell (AVIC) to undergo phenotypic change. The AVIC first assumes an inflammatory phenotype characterized by the production of inflammatory mediators such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). This change has been linked with an osteogenic phenotypic response. Statins have recently been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. We therefore hypothesized that statins may have an anti-inflammatory effect on human AVICs by downregulation of TLR4-stimulated inflammatory responses. Our purposes were (1) to determine the effect of simvastatin on TLR4-induced expression of inflammatory mediators in human AVICs and (2) to determine the mechanism(s) through which simvastatin exert this effect. Human AVICs were isolated from the explanted hearts of four patients undergoing cardiac transplantation. Cells were treated with simvastatin (50 μM) for 1 h before stimulation with TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.2 μg/mL). Immunoblotting (IB) was used to analyze cell lysates for ICAM-1 expression, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect IL-8 and MCP-1 in cell culture media. Likewise, lysates were analyzed for TLR4 and nuclear factor-kappa B activation (IB). After simvastatin treatment, lysates were analyzed for TLR4 levels (IB). Statistics were by analysis of variance (P < 0.05). Simvastatin reduced TLR4-induced ICAM-1, IL-8, and MCP-1 expression in AVICs. Simvastatin down-regulated TLR4 levels and suppressed TLR4-induced phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappa B. These data demonstrate the potential of a medical therapy (simvastatin) to impact the pathogenesis of aortic stenosis. 'Aortic stenosis', 'Statin', 'Valve interstitial cell'
