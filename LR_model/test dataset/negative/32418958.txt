Reduction of Cold Ischemic Injury with the Addition of Compound Glycyrrhizin in HTK Solution in a Mouse Heart Transplantation Model. Cold ischemic injury in heart storage is an important issue pertaining to heart transplantation. This study aims to evaluate the addition of compound glycyrrhizin (CG) in histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution on chronic isograft injury in comparison to traditional HTK solution.Hearts of mouse were stored for 8 h in 4°C cold preservation solution and then transplanted heterotopically into mouse. Five groups were evaluated: HTK, low dose of CG solution (LCG), medium dose of CG solution (MCG), high dose of CG solution (HCG), and hearts without cold ischemia (sham). Survival was assessed. Time to restoration of heartbeat and strength of the heartbeat was measured. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) levels in the preservation solution were determined. The myocardial damage and interstitial ﬁbrosis of transplanted hearts were evaluated. TGF-β1 expression in the transplanted hearts was assessed.Addition of CG to HTK solution signiﬁcantly attenuated cold ischemic injury during cold storage, as evidenced by the lower time to restoration of heartbeat, higher strength of the heartbeat, lower LDH, and CK leakage. After transplantation, hearts stored in HTK solution containing CG had decreased the myocardial damage and interstitial ﬁbrosis, compared with those stored without CG. The percentage of TGF-β1-positive cells and TGF-β1 level in the transplanted hearts were also decreased when stored in CG-containing HTK solution.The addition of CG to HTK solution attenuates cold ischemic injury during cold storage.
