A simple technique for a new working heterotopic heart transplantation model in rats. A new working model of heterotopic heart transplantation in rats was established using a simplified technique. Sprague-Dawley rats were used as donors and recipients. The donor left common carotid artery and left pulmonary artery were anastomosed to the recipient left renal artery and vein by a "sleeve and cuff" method, respectively. The donor left ventricle was blood volume loaded by anastomosing the left atrium to the recipient's abdominal aorta in end-to-side fashion. The characteristics of the donor heart were evaluated by palpating the abdominal wall of the rats. We examined the surgical success rate, changes in heart weight, and histology at 1 month after transplantation. The model was attempted in 32 rats with the success rate of 93.7% (30/32); the 2 failed cases died due to postoperative bleeding. There was no significant difference in mean weight changes between the donor and native hearts at 1 month after transplantation (1.13 ± 0.13 g vs 1.09 ± 0.12 g, P = .244). The donor heart myocardium showed regularly shaped, unidirectional, healthy muscle similar to the native heart. The technique was easily learned, allowing less recipient surgical stress. The hemodynamic performance appeared to be similar to the normal cardiac physiological situation, and thus may be more suitable for pre-clinical studies.
