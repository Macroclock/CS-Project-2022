Renal Allograft Outcome After Simultaneous Heart and Kidney Transplantation. Chronic kidney disease frequently accompanies end-stage heart failure and may result in consideration of simultaneous heart and kidney transplantation (SHKT). In recent years, there has been a significant increase in SHKT. This single-center cohort consisted of 35 patients who underwent SHKT during 1996 to 2015. The aim of this study was to review factors that may predict better long-term outcome after SKHT. Thirteen patients (37%) had delayed graft function (DGF) after transplant (defined as the need for dialysis during the first 7 days after transplant), which was significantly associated with mechanical circulatory support device therapy and high right ventricular systolic pressure before transplant. Most of the recipients had glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥50 ml/min/1.73 m
