CD3 monitoring and thymoglobulin therapy in cardiac transplantation: clinical outcomes and pharmacoeconomic implications. CD3 monitoring of antithymocyte globulin therapy in renal transplantation has been shown to be more cost-effective than standard regimens. The objective of this study was to evaluate CD3 monitoring with Thymoglobulin in cardiac transplantation. Cardiac transplant patients who required antithymocyte globulin therapy were dose-adjusted to maintain absolute CD3 counts <25 cells/microL. Endomyocardial biopsies and hemodynamic parameters were used to assess efficacy. The incidences of hematological side effects, opportunistic infections, and malignancies were recorded; in addition we performed a cost comparison. Eight patients were treated with Thymoglobulin using CD3 monitoring to adjust the dosing. All patients responded with few side effects. Compared to standard dosing, CD3 monitoring allowed a 60% reduction in the average total dose and a 58% reduction in cost per patient. CD3 monitoring of Thymoglobulin therapy in cardiac transplant patients results in lower doses and reduced costs with equivalent efficacy and a low incidence of complications.
