Coronary allograft vasculopathy and coronary vasospasm in heart transplant recipients: a manifestation of Kounis syndrome? The pathophysiology of vasculopathy of cardiac allografts is still unknown. Coronary vasospasm and thrombosis are some rare manifestations accompanying this entity. Hypersensitivity processes and the hypersensitivity coronary syndrome (Kounis syndrome) may be associated with this potentially fatal complication. Research efforts towards this direction may shed light for prevention and treatment of this disease.
