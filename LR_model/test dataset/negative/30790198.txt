Enhanced myocardial protection in cardiac donation after circulatory death using Intralipid Intralipid After induction of anesthesia, surgical preparation, termination of ventilator support, and cardiac arrest, hearts of female pigs were procured following a 15 min standoff period, with an optimized normokalemic crystalloid adenosine-lidocaine cardioplegia. Hearts were then randomly allocated to ex vivo reperfusion (38Â°C) in the absence (control) or presence of 1% ILE. All hearts were perfused with blood and Krebs-Henseleit solution (1:1) for 30 min in Langendorff mode and for an additional 30 min in working mode to assess mechanical function. Left ventricular (LV) biopsies were obtained after five minutes of reperfusion and LV tissue was preserved at the end of reperfusion for biochemical analyses and immunohistochemistry. Intralipid Our data show that ILE postconditioning elicits protection signalling in large mammalian hearts while mimicking clinical conditions, and is capable of enhancing protection of DCD hearts.
