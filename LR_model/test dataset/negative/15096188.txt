Identification, functional analysis and expression in a heterotopic heart transplant model of CXCL9 in the rat. CXCR3 chemokines are of particular interest because of their potential involvement in a variety of inflammatory diseases, including the rejection of organ transplants. Although the rat is one of the most appropriate animals for using to study transplantation biology, the structural and functional characteristics of CXCL9 [monokine induced by interferon-gamma (Mig)] in this experimental model have not been described. Therefore, we recently conducted a series of experiments to identify and characterize the rat CXCL9 gene. Accordingly, we isolated rat CXCL9 cDNA and genomic DNA. The rat CXCL9 gene encodes a protein of 125 amino acids and spans a 3.5 kbp DNA segment containing four exons in the protein-coding region. We then analysed mRNA expression in various tissues. Transcripts for the gene were found to be expressed at high levels in the lymph nodes and spleen. Then, to confirm the function of the identified gene, rat CXCL9 was transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. Rat recombinant Mig displayed chemotactic properties and induced CXCR3 internalization in CD4+ T cells. Lastly, we analysed the expression of rat CXCL9 in a heterotopic heart allograft model. Both mRNA and protein levels of intragraft CXCL9 were significantly increased following transplantation of ACI to LEW hearts when compared with syngeneic controls. These findings indicate that rat CXCL9 has an in vivo role in the infiltration of CD4+ T cells in the transplanted graft.
