Syenergistic effect of 15-deoxyspergualin with costimulation blockade on alloimmune response. A virally induced alloreactive memory seems to represent a potent barrier to tolerance induction but the combination of 15-deoxyspergualin (DSG), an inhibitor of NFkB translocation, with costimulation blockade (CB)-based chimerism as an induction regimen can overcome a preformed anti-donor memory response. In this study, we investigate the ability of DSG with CB to inhibit a naive alloimmune responses. A BALB/c (H-2d) skin or heart was transplanted into a C57BL/6 (H-2b) recipient treated with anti-CD154 mAb (MR1; 500 mcg/d on days 0, 2, 4, 6) alone, DSG (5 mg/kg/d, days 0 to 7) alone, or both agents. Proliferation of alloreactive T cells after each treatment was also examined using a graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) model using the fluorescent dye CFSE. Treatment with DSG alone induced prolonged survival of the cardiac allografts (median survival time [MST]: 97.5 days). MR1 alone induced indefinite survival of cardiac allografts, although at 150 days after transplantation, the histology showed changes characteristic of chronic rejection, including interstitial fibrosis, infiltration of mononuclear cells, and intimal hyperplasia in coronary vessels. Combined treatment with DSG and MR1 induced donor-specific unresponsiveness in all recipients, graft histology showed only minimal infiltration. Treatment with DSG and MR1 also significantly prolonged the survival of skin allografts (MST: 31 days) compared with that of DSG or MR1 alone (MST: 17 and 14 days, respectively). In the GvHD model assessed with CFSE, the combined treatment was the more effective to suppress proliferation of alloreactive T cells while DSG alone inhibited proliferation more than MR1 alone. DSG potentiates anti-CD154 therapy to suppress the alloimmune response.
