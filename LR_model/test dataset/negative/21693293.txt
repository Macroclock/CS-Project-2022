Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand is a marker of kidney function and inflammation in heart and kidney transplant recipients. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) was originally identified as the third member of the TNF superfamily to induce apoptosis. TRAIL is normally expressed in many human tissues including kidney. Circulating soluble TRAIL is a negative marker for inflammation and is inversely associated with the mortality risk in chronic kidney disease patients. One increasingly prevalent complication in heart transplant recipients appears to be chronic kidney disease. The aim of the study was to assess TRAIL concentration in 136 heart transplant recipients and 80 prevalent kidney allograft recipients in relation to kidney function. Complete blood count, urea, serum lipids, fasting glucose, creatinine, NT-proBNP were studied. Soluble TRAIL, hsCR P, interleukin-6 (IL-6), von willebrand factor (vWF) were assayed using commercially available kits. Heart transplant recipients had significantly higher serum creatinine, urea, cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, white blood cell count, serum TRAIL and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate than the control group. Similar results were obtained for kidney allograft recipients. Serum TRAIL levels fell, together with decline in glomerular filtration rate in heart transplant patients. Serum TRAIL was related to age, kidney function, erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, NT-proBNP, New York Heart Association class, presence of diabetes, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), IL-6, and ejection fraction. Age and HDL turn out to be predictors of TRAIL in heart transplant recipients. In kidney transplant recipients, TRAIL was related, in univariate analysis, to age, NT-proBNP, time after transplantation, kidney function, and vWF. In multiple regression analysis, predictors of TRAIL were vWF and time after transplantation. TRAIL may represent a surrogate marker of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis as these processes are accelerated in heart and kidney dysfunction.
