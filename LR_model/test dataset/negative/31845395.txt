Factors influencing transfusion-associated HLA sensitization in patients bridged to heart transplantation using ventricular assist device. Bridging heart failure patients with mechanical ventricular assist devices (VAD) enables access to transplantation. However, VAD is associated with increased risk for anti-HLA antibodies associated with rejection of subsequent allografts. Factors determining alloantibody formation in these patients remain undefined. We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of 164 patients undergoing heart transplantation from 2014 to 2017. Medical records including use of VAD, transfused blood products, anti-HLA antibody testing, crossmatch, and time to transplant were evaluated. Patients received an average of 13.8 red blood cell and 1.9 single-donor platelet units associated with VAD. There was a 28.7% increase in the incidence of anti-HLA antibodies after VAD. Development of anti-HLA antibodies did not correlate with volume or type of blood products, but with pre-VAD HLA sensitization status; relative risk of new alloantibodies in patients with pre-VAD antibodies was 3.5-fold higher than those without prior antibodies (P = .008). Development of new anti-HLA antibodies was associated with an increased time to transplant (169 vs 330 days, P = .013). Our findings indicate that the presence of anti-HLA antibodies pre-VAD was the most significant risk factor for developing additional antibodies post-VAD, suggesting that a subset of patients may be predisposed to alloantibody formation.
