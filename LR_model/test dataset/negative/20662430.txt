[Management of deep device related infection in patient implanted with mechanical cardiac support device using V.A.C. system]. Infection remains the most significant cause of morbidity and mortality in pacients implanted with mechanical circulatory support devices (MCSD), reaching prevalence of 40-60% according various authors. Successful treatment of the whole spectrum of infectious complications is the basic determinant in archieving good results in MCSD patients. The treatment involves standard surgical procedures, as well as the use of vacuum assisted closure (V.A.C.) therapy in the last few years. We demonstrate successful management of deep device related infection using V.A.C therapy in a patient with MCSD, giving him the opportunity to heart transplantation, and thereafter successful treatment of poststernotomy mediastinitis in this imunosupressed pacient after heart transplantation.
