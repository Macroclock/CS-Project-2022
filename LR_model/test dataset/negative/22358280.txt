Non Working Beating Heart: a new strategy of myocardial protection during heart transplant. We attempt to reduce the ischemic time during implantation of the donor heart in the bicaval bipulmonary orthotopic position using normothermic beating heart and thus, facilitate the transplanted heart adaptation to the recipient. This study presents a small experience about a new strategy of myocardial protection during heart transplant. In cardiopulmonary bypass, the aorta anastomosis was done first, allowing the coronary arteries to receive blood flow and the recovering of the beats. The rest of the anastomosis is performed on a beating heart in sinus rhythm. The pulmonary anastomosis is the last to be done. This methodology was applied in 10 subjects: eight males, age 16-69 (mean 32.7 years), SPAo 90-100 mmHg (mean 96 mmHg), SPAP 25-65 mmHg (mean 46.1 mmHg), PVR 0.9 to 5.0 Wood (mean 3.17 Wood), GTP 4-13 mmHg (mean 7.9 mmHg), and eight male donors, age 15-48 years (mean 27.7 years), weight 65-114 kg (mean 83.1 kg). Causes of brain coma: encephalic trauma in five hemorrhagic stroke in four, and brain tumor in one. The ischemic time ranged from 58-90 minutes (mean 67.6 minutes) and 8 donors were in hospitals of Sao Paulo and two in distant cities. All grafts assumed the cardiac output requiring low-dose inotropic therapy and maintained these conditions in the postoperative period. There were no deaths and all were discharged. The late evolution goes from 20 days to 10 months with one death occurred after 4 months due to sepsis. This method, besides reducing the ischemic time of the procedure, allows the donated organ to regain and maintain their beats without pre or after load during implantation entailing the physiological recovery of the graft.
