The need for a tailored immunosuppression in older heart transplant recipients. Advanced recipient age is considered a relative contraindication for heart transplantation because it might be associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We analyzed 349 consecutive heart transplantations performed at our institution from 1995 to 2002 (n = 349, mean follow-up 3.5 +/- 2.5 years). The survival rate was lower in older recipients. Less chronic rejection but increased risk for infectious complications, renal failure and neoplasms indicate the need for decreased immunosuppression and effective infection prophylaxis in older recipients.
