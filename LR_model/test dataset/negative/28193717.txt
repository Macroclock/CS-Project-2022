Differences in Presentation and Outcomes Between Children With Familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Children With Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy: A Report From the Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry Study Group. Research comparing the survival of children with familial dilated cardiomyopathy (FDCM) to that of children with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) has produced conflicting results. We analyzed data from children with FDCM or IDCM using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry. Compared to children with IDCM (n=647), children with FDCM (n=223) were older (mean 6.2 versus 4.5 years,  There was no survival difference between FDCM and IDCM after adjustment for other factors. Older age, congestive heart failure, and greater left ventricular dilation at diagnosis were independently associated with increased risk of the combined end point of death or transplantation.
