Chest X-ray of a patient with history of pleural effusion. The presented chest X-ray depicts the thoracic duct anatomy of a 50-year-old man who underwent heart transplantation. His postoperative course was complicated by Candida mediastinitis, treated with débridements and closure of the anterior chest wound with myocutaneous flaps. Postoperatively, he had persistent output from a right-sided chest tube. The fluid appeared milky and its triglycerides level was elevated at 254 mg/dL. The drainage persisted despite a low fat diet. The interventional radiologist identified a leak in the upper thoracic duct. It was embolised with coil and onyx. After the procedure, the chylous pleural effusions resolved. The thoracic duct has been visualised on subsequent chest X-rays (figures 1 and 2). 'heart failure', 'interventional radiology'
