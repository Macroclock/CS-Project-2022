Heart transplant candidates: factors influencing waiting list mortality. Cardiac transplantation is a successful treatment for end-stage heart disease. However the number of potential candidates is significantly greater then number of suitable organ donors. We reviewed the characteristics of new transplant candidates presenting for assessment for cardiac transplantation to the Irish Heart & Lung Transplant programme over a one year period. Of 44 patients referred for assessment, 24 (54.5%) were listed for cardiac transplantation. Six have died while awaiting transplantation, seven have been transplanted and eleven remain on the active transplant list. The six month survival rate on the transplant waiting list is 74%. Although the Irish system of organ donation has traditionally provided high organ donation rates in comparison with other countries, the demand for suitable heart donors exceeds supply. Newer methods of promoting and facilitating organ donation may prove beneficial in improving the number of donations and addressing the long waiting time for cardiac transplantation.
