[Cost analysis of cardiac transplantation in a Spanish hospital]. Heart transplant requires a heavy use of high cost resources. Economic data related to this procedure had not been specifically addressed and there are very few publications which analyze this topic. The aim of this study was to analyze the costs related to heart transplant in a series of patients from a single institution. Data from all patients included in the Hospital Cl√≠nic heart transplant programme in which a cardiac transplant was effectively performed between 1999 and 2000 were analyzed, including one year of follow-up. Patients who died within this first year were also included. Organ procurement costs were excluded. Cost analysis was performed by micro-costing techniques. A total of 21 patients undergoing a heart transplant were included. One year survival rate was 76%. Mean (standard deviation) of total cost (procedure costs + one year follow-up cost) was 59,349 (18,881) euros (range: 29,380-113,470 euros). Procedure mean cost was 41,724 (17,584) euros (70% of total costs) and one year follow up mean cost was 17,625 (10,096) euros (30% of total costs) per patient. When the initial episode (heart transplant procedure) was analyzed, main cost drivers were personnel costs euros 59% of all costs; mean: 24,795 (7,633) euros and treatment costs -20% of all costs; mean: 8,386 (7,250) euros. Costs of heart transplant in Barcelona (Spain) are similar to those published for other European Union countries, and well below the costs related to the procedure in the United States.
