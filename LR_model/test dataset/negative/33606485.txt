Operative Technique of Donor Organ Procurement for En Bloc Heart-liver Transplantation. Combined heart-liver transplant is an emerging option for patients with indications for heart transplantation and otherwise prohibitive hepatic dysfunction. Heart-liver transplantation is particularly relevant for patients with single ventricle physiology who often develop Fontan-associated liver disease and fibrosis. Although only performed at a limited number of centers, several approaches to combined heart-liver transplantation have been described. The en bloc technique offers several potential advantages over the traditional sequential technique. Specifically, en bloc heart-liver transplantation may allow improved hemodynamics, decreased bleeding, reduced liver allograft ischemic time, and may result in reduced rates of graft dysfunction. Here we describe our center's en bloc heart-liver procurement technique in detail, with the aim of allowing broader use and standardization of this technique.
