Donation after cardiac death in Queensland: review of the pilot project. Organ transplantation is a viable therapeutic option for patients with endstage organ failure when other therapies have been exhausted. Donation after cardiac death (DCD) is re-emerging as a potential option to expand the donor pool to meet an increasing demand for organ transplantation. In this review, we evaluate the evolution of the Queensland DCD pilot project since its inception in August 2008. A retrospective analysis of registry data from Australia and New Zealand Organ Donation (ANZOD) and DonateLife Queensland was performed to collect information relating to donor characteristics, DCD process and outcomes. Data was compared with the ANZOD registry annual reports from 2008 to 2010. Twenty-three (82%) out of 28 potential DCD organ donors were successful in donating their organs. The median time from presentation to reaching consensus to withdraw cardiorespiratory support was four days (interquartile range three to eight days). The median time from withdrawal to death was 20 minutes (interquartile range 18 to 25 minutes), and the median warm ischaemia time was 17 minutes (interquartile range 14 to 19 minutes). DCD donors represented 16% (23) of the 144 deceased donors over the study period and provided approximately 10% (48) of the 505 deceased organs in Queensland. The DCD pilot project resulted in an increase in solid organ transplantation in Queensland. It allowed the development of policies to facilitate DCD, in accordance with state's legislation and DonateLife practices. If implemented state-wide, the program has the potential to be an effective way to improve organ donation rates in Queensland.
