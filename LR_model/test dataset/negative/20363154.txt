Minimally invasive, off-pump explant of a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device. The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has been used successfully for bridge to transplant and destination therapy. In some cases, myocardial recovery is possible and allows LVAD explantation. We describe a novel explant technique for the HeartMate II LVAD using small incisions on a beating heart, without cardiopulmonary bypass.
