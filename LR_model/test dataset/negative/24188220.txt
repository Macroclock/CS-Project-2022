The pulmonary artery catheter: a critical reappraisal. Balloon floatation pulmonary artery catheters (PACs) have been used for hemodynamic monitoring in cardiac, medical, and surgical intensive care units since the 1970s. With the availability of newer noninvasive diagnostic modalities, particularly echocardiography, the frequency of diagnostic pulmonary artery catheterization has declined. In this review, the evolution of PACs, the results of nonrandomized and randomized studies in various clinical conditions, the uses and abuses of bedside hemodynamic monitoring, and current indications for pulmonary artery catheterization are discussed.
