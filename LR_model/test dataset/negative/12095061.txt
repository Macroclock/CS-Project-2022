Interleukin 1 and chronic rejection: possible genetic links in human heart allografts. Chronic rejection is a leading cause of graft loss in thoracic transplant recipients. Studies on the pathogenesis of chronic rejection have suggested a contributory role for certain cytokines and growth factors. The activity of these mediators is subject to genetic variation if a polymorphism alters expression, or function, of the ligand or its receptor. Here we have asked if certain cytokine and growth factor gene polymorphisms correlate with chronic rejection in recipients of thoracic allografts. In a retrospective analysis of 179 recipients of thoracic organ transplants (128 heart; 36 heart-lung; and 15 lung), polymorphisms in 8 genes that influence the inflammatory process, namely IL1B, IL1R1, IL1RN, IL6, IL10, TNFA, TGFB1 and FCGRIIA, were examined. Genotypic data from recipients who had either died or been re-transplanted as a result of chronic rejection (n = 96) were then compared to those of recipients who had a functioning graft for more than 11 years (n=83). In the heart graft recipients, only those polymorphisms that influenced expression of the IL1 receptor antagonist gene had a significant correlation with graft survival, with homozygosity for the IL1RN*1 allele being associated with rejection. The alternative, less frequent IL1RN alleles emerged as genomic predictors of long-term allograft survival. This association was especially strong when IL1 region haplotypes were considered, particularly when analysis was confined to heart transplant recipients who had had multiple acute rejection episodes (OR>20). This case-control study indicates that gene polymorphisms which influence IL1 bioactivity also influence the progression of chronic rejection in heart grafts.
