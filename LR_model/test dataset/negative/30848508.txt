Novel colchicine derivatives enhance graft survival after transplantation via suppression of T-cell differentiation and activity. Immunosuppressants are crucial in organ transplantation but their side effects are a trade-off for long-term use. Colchicine has been shown to be effective in various diseases, albeit with many side effects. To enhance the immunosuppressive effects of colchicine, in addition to minimizing its side effects, we attempted to synthesize new colchicine derivatives (KR compounds). In rat cardiac and pancreatic islet allograft, long-term graft survival was identified in KR compound-treated groups. The use of cyclosporine A (CsA) or colchicine inhibited the CD3 'colchicine', 'colchicine derivatives', 'cyclosporine A', 'immunosuppressant', 'organ transplantation'
