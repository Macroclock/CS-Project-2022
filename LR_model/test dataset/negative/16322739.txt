The first successful DeBakey VAD child implantation as a bridge to transplant. A 14-year-old boy with repaired transposition of the great arteries and ventricular septal defect presented with atrial flutter and severe congestive heart failure. Despite successful cardioversion and optimal medical therapy, the patient deteriorated and was supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Two days after initiating ECMO support, we implanted the DeBakey VAD Child ventricular assist device (MicroMed Technology, Inc., Houston, TX) under the Humanitarian Device Exemption program. Later, he was able to pursue normal daily activities including physical rehabilitation and ambulation in the hospital. After 56 days, he underwent a successful cardiac transplantation. After 3 months, he had good cardiac function and no evidence of rejection. The DeBakey VAD Child device is a valuable option for cardiac support as a bridge to transplantation.
