Improved survival in patients with continuous-flow ventricular assist device for bridge to heart transplantation. Contemporary continuous-flow ventricular assist devices (CFVADs) have greatly improved patient survival for indications of bridge to transplantation (BTT) and destination therapy. In Japan, CFVAD is limited for BTT use. The waiting period for heart transplantation (HT) is long owing to donor shortage. We examined the results of CFVAD for BTT indication. Eighty-nine VAD treatments were performed among subjects whose preimplantation condition was profile 1 (n = 49) or profile 2 or 3 (n = 40). The device was the paracorporeal pulsatile Nipro VAD (n = 67) or CFVAD (n = 22). All CFVAD patients were profile 2 or 3. The median assist period was 529 days (Nipro VAD, 530; CFVAD, 528). Twenty-six patients were on the device for >2 years. Actuarial survival was 81.6%, 69.5%, and 61.1% at 1, 3, and 5 years. Survival in profile 1 was significantly worse than in profile 2 or 3. Survival of CFVAD patients was superior to that of paracorporeal VAD. Six-month mortality rate of 20% in cases before 2009 (n = 60) was dramatically improved to 3% among those after 2010 (n = 29). All patients with CFVAD were alive and discharged home. 26 patients were transplanted, 7 had been weaned from VAD and 27 were on a device. The rate of events requiring hospital admission was 0.98 per patient-year in CFVAD patients. Contemporary CFVADs have enabled advanced heart failure patients to await HT safely with an improved quality of life. The advent of CFVAD has also shifted their preimplantation condition to a less sick status. CFVADs were the safest, most reliable circulatory support devices for long-term waiting periods for the BTT indications.
