Usefulness of stanford scale of intimal hyperplasia assessed by intravascular ultrasound to predict time of onset and severity of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. The purpose of this study was to assess the prognostic value of a single IVUS result described by the Stanford scale to predict CAV development. Inclusion criteria were heart transplantation (OHT) before 1997 and at least one IVUS performed before 1998. IVUS studies were performed in 37 patients at 37 +/- 26 months after OHT. Based on the Stanford scale, were divided patients into Four groups: group I (grade 0 or 1): n = 4, 42 +/- 19 years, 2 men/2 women; group II (grade 2): n = 10, 44 +/- 15 years, 9 men/1 woman; group III (grade 3): n = 11, 48 +/- 11 years, 11 men; and group IV (grade 4): n = 12, 46 +/- 8 years, 12 men. We compared the incidence and time of onset of clinically significant CAV, namely significant coronary lesions, myocardial infarction and death caused by CAV. There was no CAV diagnosed in group I. The rates of CAV in coronary angiograms in groups II, III and IV were: 80%, 36%, and 75%, respectively. Significant CAV was found in 30%, 9%, and 50% of patients, respectively. Average times of onset of any CAV in groups II, III and IV were 4.9, 5.6, and 3.3 years, and for significant CAV were 4.1, 3.6, and 5.5 years, respectively. Deaths in groups I to IV were 1, 4, 2, and 5, respectively. CAV was the reason for death in 1 patient from group III, and 3 patients from group IV. Extreme grades on the Stanford scale (0, 1, and 4) describing a single IVUS study in OHT recipients appear useful to stratify patients with the lowest versus the highest risk of CAV development.
