ProtekDuo as a bridge to lung transplant and heart-lung transplant. Recent advances in technology have led to significantly greater use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a bridge to lung transplantation with better outcomes. The novel ProtekDuo veno-venous ECMO (CardiacAssist, Inc.) has gained significance as it facilitates effective decompression of the right heart in patients with acute decompensation, while also providing consistent and effective gas exchange by eliminating recirculation. Here, we report two cases of effectively using ProtekDuo veno-venous ECMO: one case as a bridge to lung transplantation and another case as a bridge to heart-lung transplantation.
