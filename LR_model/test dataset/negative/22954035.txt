Second line options for hyperlipidemia management after cardiac transplantation. Despite widespread statin therapy, 91% of cardiac transplant patients have hyperlipidemia within 5 years from cardiac transplantation. The implications of this are profound, particularly given that coronary allograft vasculopathy is a leading cause of death. Unfortunately the solution is not easy, with problems of toleration at higher statin doses and a lack of good quality evidence for second line agents. We review the literature and discuss some of the key issues transplant physicians are faced with when considering alternatives to statin therapy.
