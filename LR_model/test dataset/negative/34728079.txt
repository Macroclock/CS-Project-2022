Echocardiography-Based Hemodynamic Monitoring Use on Inpatients Listed for Heart Transplantation Under 2018 Allocation Policy in United States. One notable change to the 2018 United Network for Organ Sharing listing criteria was to allow for the use of noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring for inpatients listed as status 3 for heart transplantation. We wanted to explore the feasibility of performing daily focused echocardiograms in place of invasive monitoring in this population. On retrospective chart review of inpatients listed for transplantation at our institution, 8 patients in the invasive monitoring group listed as status 1A (October 2016 to October 2018) and 9 patients in the echocardiographic group listed as status 3 (October 2018 to February 2020) were identified. There were no significant differences between the 2 cohorts in the average measured/estimated right atrial, pulmonary artery systolic, and wedge pressures, although the echo cohort had lower cardiac index (P = .001). There were 2 patients with positive blood cultures treated with Swan exchange in Swan cohort and a total of 14 Swan exchanges. There were no infections in the noninvasive group. We present our experience with the use of noninvasive daily hemodynamic assessment using focused echocardiograms to manage patients undergoing heart transplantation listing as status 3 under the new United Network for Organ Sharing allocation system. This approach appears safe and feasible; however, it requires validation in larger cohorts.
