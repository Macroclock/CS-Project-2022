Surgical Technique to Facilitate Explantation of Mechanical Circulatory Support Devices: LVADs, BiVADs, and TAHs Before Heart Transplantation. Thoughtful preparation of the surgical field at the time of initial mechanical circulatory support (MCS) implantation has the potential for decreasing operative time and surgical risk of subsequent heart transplantation. It sets the stage for expeditious, safe sternal reentry, and identification of structures necessary for initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
