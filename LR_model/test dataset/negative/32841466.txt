Bartonella henselae infection in the pediatric solid organ transplant recipient. Bartonella henselae infection can cause a wide spectrum of diseases in both the immunocompetent and immunocompromised host with BA a severe form relegated to immunocompromised hosts, including solid organ transplant population. There are established criteria for diagnosis of Bartonella infection based on clinical presentation, serologic testing, imaging studies and, when indicated, tissue sampling for histopathological evaluation, particularly for BA. However, treatment recommendations for BA are inconclusive. Furthermore, there are no studies in the pediatric solid organ transplant population for antimicrobial therapy during BA secondary to Bartonella henselae infection. A case of BA following heart transplant is presented along with a literature review of clinical presentation; diagnosis and therapy for BA in the pediatric solid organ transplant population.
