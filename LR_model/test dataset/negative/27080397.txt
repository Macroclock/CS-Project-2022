Simultaneous presentation of giant aneurysms of the coronary sinus and superior vena cava. Aneurysms of the coronary sinus and superior vena cava are rare and their aetiologies remain controversial. Some studies have shown that these acquired venous aneurysms are caused by an increase in right atrial pressure, which may be related to right heart failure. However, few reports have provided direct evidence to support this hypothesis. We present a rare case of combined giant aneurysms of the coronary sinus and vena cava, diagnosed using multiple imaging modalities. This case strongly supports the hypothesis that right heart diastolic failure may be an important mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of combined giant aneurysms.
