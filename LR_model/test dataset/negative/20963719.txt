[Subjective experiences following organ transplantation--a qualitative study of 120 heart, lung, liver, and kidney recipients]. The communication with patients who have undergoned transplantation is greatly influenced by their subjective experience. This paper deals with this subjective transplant-specific experience six months after surgery. Following their heart, lung, liver, or kidney transplantation, 120 patients were questioned concerning their experiences regarding the transplantation, the organ itself, and changes in their personal life. Their statements were investigated by qualitative content analysis. Generally, the statements concerning the transplantation were positive. Interpersonal contact with the medical staff and or family members was perceived as very helpful. Two-thirds of the patients spoke openly about their organ. For the most part, their statements about changes in their personal life were positive, expressed in the sense of personal growth. Fears and insecurities occurred as negative changes. On the whole, the majority of the patients expressed positive experiences regarding their transplantation. Interpersonal and supportive relationships played a significant role.
