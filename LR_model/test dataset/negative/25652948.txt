Cardiac allograft vasculopathy: a donor or recipient induced pathology? Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is one of the main causes of late-stage heart failure after heart transplantation. CAV is characterized by concentric luminal narrowing of the coronary arteries, but the exact pathogenesis of CAV is still not unraveled. Many researchers show evidence of an allogeneic immune response of the recipient, whereas others show contrasting results in which donor-derived cells induce an immune response against the graft. In addition, fibrosis of the neo-intima can be induced by recipient-derived circulating cells or donor-derived cells. In this review, both donor and recipient sides of the story are described to obtain better insight in the pathogenesis of CAV. Dual outcomes were found regarding the contribution of donor and recipient cells in the initiation of the immune response and the development of fibrosis during CAV. Future research could focus more on the potential synergistic interaction of donor and recipient cells leading to CAV.
