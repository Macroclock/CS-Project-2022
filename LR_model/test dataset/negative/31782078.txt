The Approach to the Psychosocial Evaluation of Cardiac Transplant and Mechanical Circulatory Support Candidates. We update evidence underlying the recommendations of a 2018 multi-society consensus report regarding the psychosocial evaluation of individuals for cardiothoracic transplantation and mechanical circulatory support (MCS). In the present review, we focus on heart transplantation and MCS. Expert opinion and new evidence support the inclusion of ten core content areas in the psychosocial evaluation. Prospective data indicate that psychosocial factors can predict post-transplantation/post-implantation outcomes. Such factors include treatment adherence history, mental health and substance use history, cognitive impairment, knowledge about treatment options, and social factors such as socioeconomic status. For other factors (e.g., coping, social support), new evidence is weaker because it derives largely from cross-sectional studies. Concerning evaluation process issues, expert opinion remains consistent with consensus recommendations, but there is a dearth of empirical evidence. The psychosocial evaluation can identify factors relevant for candidacy for heart transplantation and MCS implantation. It enables the provision of interventions to improve patients' viability as candidates, and facilitates care planning.
