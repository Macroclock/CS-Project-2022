Primary cutaneous CD30+ T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder following cardiac transplantation in a 15-year-old boy with Netherton's syndrome. Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (PCTCLDs) are uncommon in organ transplant recipients. CD30+ PCTCLDs are rare in children and have not previously been reported following organ transplantation. We report a 15-year-old boy with Netherton's syndrome who developed CD30+ PCTCLD 6 years following a cardiac transplantation.
