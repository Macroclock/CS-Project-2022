Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and high-dose continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration in a young child as a successful bridge to heart transplant for management of combined heart and kidney failure: a case report. Combined heart and kidney transplant is an established treatment modality in patients with coexisting end-stage heart and kidney failure. However, there is scarce information on the optimal management of children that are listed for cardiac transplantation with mild to severe renal dysfunction. Herein we report the case of a young child who presented with life-threatening dilative cardiomyopathy and severe renal dysfunction, and who required urgent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation associated with continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration and eventually underwent successful isolated heart transplantation followed by complete recovery of kidney function.
