ECG in dilated cardiomyopathy: specific findings and long-term prognostic significance. The objective was to provide an exhaustive characterization of ECG features in a large cohort of dilated cardiomyopathies (DCMs) and then investigate their possible prognostic role in the long term. ECG is an accessible, reproducible, low-cost diagnostic and prognostic tool. However, an extensive description of ECG features and their long-term prognostic role in a large cohort of DCM is lacking. All available baseline ECGs of DCM patients enrolled from 1992 to 2013 were systematically analysed. Patients underwent to a complete clinical-laboratory evaluation. The study outcome measures were death or heart transplant (D/HT) and sudden death or malignant ventricular arrhythmias (SD/MVA). Four hundred and fourteen DCM patients were enrolled. During a median follow-up of 125 months, 55 and 57 patients experienced D/HT and SD/MVA, respectively. At multivariate analysis, left ventricular hypertrophy (P = 0.017), heart rate (HR, P = 0.005) and anterolateral T-wave inversion (P = 0.041) predicted D/HT. Regarding SD/MVA, S wave amplitude in V2 (P = 0.008), R wave amplitude in DIII (P = 0.007), anterolateral T-wave inversion (P = 0.017) emerged as predictors. At receiver-operating curve analyses, the addition of ECG models to the clinical-laboratory evaluation significantly increased the area under the curve both for D/HT (from 0.68 to 0.74, P = 0.042) and SD/MVA (from 0.70 to 0.77, P = 0.048). The exhaustive systematic evaluation of ECG has an incremental impact in the prognostication of a large cohort of DCM patients, also regarding the arrhythmic stratification.
