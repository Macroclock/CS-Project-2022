The experiences of heart transplant recipients' spouses during the pretransplant waiting period: integrative review. To explore the experiences of spouses of heart transplant recipients and to consider how an understanding of these experiences may inform nursing practice. There is a lack of knowledge about the experiences of spouses of heart transplant recipients during the pretransplant wait. Evidence suggests that spousal support improves post-transplant outcomes of heart transplant recipients; therefore, it is important to understand how nurses can improve spouses' psychological well-being during the pretransplant wait. Integrative review. A search of six electronic databases between November 2015-December 2015 and a hand search yielded 510 citations; nine studies met the review eligibility criteria. Inclusion criteria were applied to selected studies for review. Methodological quality of selected studies was evaluated, and data were extracted and compiled. Six themes were identified: uncertainty, thoughts about death, changes to lifestyle and priorities, loss of sense of self, quality of life and learning to cope. Spouses experience high levels of stress caused by uncertainty about the patient's survival, increased responsibilities and changes to their lifestyle. The results reveal that the pretransplant period is all-consuming for spouses of heart transplant recipients. The impact of the pretransplant wait on spouses' well-being should be recognised by nurses, and improvements must be made in support and education available to spouses during the pre-transplant period. There is a need for improved education about the transplant process, and reinforcement of positive coping strategies.
