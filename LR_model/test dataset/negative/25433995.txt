Expression of HSPA12B in acute cardiac allograft rejection in rats. HSP70 may play a more important role in regulating antigen-specific immune response than other HSPs; however, HSPA12B production in transplanted heart remains obscure, which was identified as the newest member of the HSP70 family. In the current study, we performed a heart transplantation model in adult rats and investigated the dynamic changes of HSPA12B expression in the cardiac grafts. The cardiac grafts of allogeneic (Wistar-Lewis rat) and syngeneic (Lewis-Lewis rat) rat models were subjected to histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses for HSPA12B expression on days 0-7 after operation. We also examined the expression profiles of active caspase-3, whose changes were correlated with the expression profiles of HSPA12B. Our results demonstrated that HSPA12B protein exhibited biphasic patterns in transplanted heart. The first expression phase correlated with ischemical reperfusion injury over 2 days post-transplant. The second peak of HSPA12B expression was found only in allografts on day 5, concurrent with the expression of caspase-3. Immunohistochemical assay showed that compared with rare expression in isografts, there were significant protein expressions of HSPA12B and caspase-3 in heart allografts from day 5 to 7 post-transplant. Furthermore, double immunofluorescence staining for active caspase-3 and HSPA12B in isografts and allografts at day 5 post-transplant were analyzed and colocalization of HSPA12B/active caspase-3 was detected in allografts. In conclusion, this is the first description of HSPA12B expression in acute cardiac allograft rejection. Our results suggested that HSPA12B might play crucial roles in heart pathophysiology after transplantation.  'Allograft', 'Apoptosis', 'HSPA12B', 'Heart transplantation'
