Sinus node dysfunction in a heart transplant patient secondary to severe sinus node artery obstruction--a case report. A case of sinus node dysfunction is reported secondary to severe sinus node artery obstruction 3 years after orthotopic heart transplantation. The patient first presented with frequent dizzy spells and presyncopal episodes for 3 months and then recurrent syncope in the presence of an acute myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography showed a diffusely narrowed sinus node artery without any apparent collateral vessels. The sinus node artery had had only minimal distal disease 3 months previously. A dual chamber permanent pacemaker was implanted with significant improvement in clinical symptoms.
