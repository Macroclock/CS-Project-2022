Calcineurin inhibitor-free immunosuppression using everolimus (Certican) in maintenance heart transplant recipients: 6 months' follow-up. Everolimus is a proliferation signal-inhibitor recently introduced in heart transplant recipients. To date, little is known about calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-free immunosuppression using everolimus. This study reports the results of CNI-free immunosuppression using everolimus. During a continuous 9-month period, 60 heart transplant recipients were enrolled. Reasons for switching to everolimus were side effects associated with prior CNI immunosuppression. All patients underwent standardized switching protocols and completed 6 months of follow-up. Blood was obtained for lipid status, renal function, routine controls, and levels of immunosuppressive agents. Echocardiography and a physical examination were performed on Days 0, 14, 28, and then every 3 months. After switching to everolimus, most patients recovered from the side effects associated with CNIs. Renal function improved significantly after 6 months (creatinine, 2.1 +/- 0.6 vs 1.5 +/- 0.9 mg/dl, p = 0.001; creatinine clearance, 42.2 +/- 21.6 vs 61.8 +/- 23.4 ml/[min x 1.73 m2], p = 0.018). Arterial hypertension improved after 3 months and remained decreased during the observation period. Tremor, peripheral edema, hirsutism, and gingival hyperplasia markedly improved. Adverse events occurred in 8 patients (13.3%), including interstitial pneumonia (n = 2), skin disorders (n = 2), reactivated hepatitis B (n = 1), and fever of unknown origin (n = 3). Preliminary data suggest that CNI-free immunosuppression using everolimus is safe, with excellent efficacy in maintenance heart transplant recipients. Arterial hypertension and renal function improved significantly. CNI-induced side effects such as tremor, peripheral edema, hirsutism, and gingival hyperplasia markedly improved in most patients.
