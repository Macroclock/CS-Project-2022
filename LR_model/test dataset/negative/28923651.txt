High-Resolution Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy for the Metabolic Assessment of Acute Rejection After Cardiac Transplantation in Rats. To evaluate the potential of high-resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS)  We transplanted syngeneic heart grafts from Lewis rats (n = 4) and allogeneic heart grafts from F344 rats (n = 4) heterotopically into Lewis recipients. On day 7 postoperatively, the transplanted hearts were harvested for ex vivo  One allogeneic graft that showed extensive necrotic change suggesting graft failure was excluded from the statistical analysis of the NMR spectroscopy. In the 4.7-T  HR-MAS
