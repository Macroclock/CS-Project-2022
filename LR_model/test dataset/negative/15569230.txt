Aspergillus mediastinitis following orthotopic heart transplantation: case report and review of the literature. Bacterial mediastinitis after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) is well described in the literature. However, little information has been published on fungal mediastinitis in this population. We describe a man with Aspergillus fumigatus mediastinitis diagnosed 10 weeks after OHT. The patient was treated with voriconazole. The literature on Aspergillus mediastinitis is also reviewed.
