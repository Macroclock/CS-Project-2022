Intratumoral immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 and TLR9 agonist induces systemic antitumor immunity without accelerating rejection of cardiac allografts. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockades, have revolutionized the field of cancer immunotherapy. However, there is a growing concern whether PD-1 inhibitors can be administered safely to transplant recipients with advanced cancer, as the T cells activated by checkpoint inhibitors may become reactive not only toward tumor antigens but also toward donor alloantigen, thereby resulting in allograft rejection. Here, immunotherapy with anti-PD-1/toll like receptor 9 agonist was administered to C57BL/6 mice bearing a cardiac allograft that were receiving maintenance immunosuppression or a PI4KIIIβ inhibitor-based tolerogenic regimen. Intratumoral (i.t.), but not systemic, immunotherapy promoted potent anti-tumor responses, but did not accelerate allograft rejection. This effect was associated with a pro-immunogenic effect induced by i.t. immunotherapy resulting in systemic cellular and humoral immune anti-tumor responses. Furthermore, when the tumor and cardiac allograft shared major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, i.t. immunotherapy promoted immune responses directed against tumor and the cardiac allograft resulting in allograft rejection. The anti-tumor effect was compromised by maintenance immunosuppression with cyclosporin A, indicating that an optimal balance between enhanced anti-tumor immunity and decreased transplant immunoreactivity is critical. A clinically relevant approach could be to temporarily withdraw maintenance immunosuppression and/or replace it with a PI4KIIIβ inhibitor-based tolerance-inducing regimen to allow for effective immunotherapy to take place.
