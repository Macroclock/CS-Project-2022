Spanish Heart Transplant Registry. 28th Official Report of the Spanish Society of Cardiology Working Group on Heart Failure (1984-2016). The present article reports the characteristics and results of heart transplants in Spain since this therapeutic modality was first used in May 1984. We summarize the main features of recipients, donors, surgical procedures, and outcomes of all cardiac transplants performed in Spain up to December 31, 2016. A total of 281 cardiac transplants were performed in 2016. The whole historical series consisted of 7869 procedures. The main features of transplant procedures in 2016 were similar to those observed in recent years. A high percentage of procedures were urgent, particularly those with use of pretransplant continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (19.1% of all transplants). Survival significantly improved in the last decade compared with previous periods. During the last few years, transplant activity in Spain has remained steady, with approximately 250-300 transplants/year. Despite a more complex clinical context, survival has improved in recent years. 'Heart transplant', 'Registro', 'Registry', 'Supervivencia', 'Survival', 'Trasplante cardiaco'
