Pulmonary complications in heart transplant recipients. Heart transplantation is an important therapeutic option for patients with end-stage disease, but is associated with major pulmonary complications. We retrospectively reviewed the posttransplant follow-up of 34 orthotopic heart transplant recipients. Two of the 34 patients died of cardiac failure in the early postoperative period. Among the surviving patients, 10 (31.3%) developed pulmonary complications, all within the first 6 months: hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia in five, fungal pneumonia in three, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease in one, and community-acquired pneumonia in one patient. None of the patients developed transplantation-related malignancy. The overall mortality was 35.3%. Pneumonia-related mortality rate of 14.7% was due to early-onset nosocomial pneumonias, which were caused by bacterial and opportunistic microorganisms. Extrapulmonary causes of mortality were cardiac failure, meningitis, septicemia, and acute rejection. Cytomegalovirus antigenemia in the first month was associated with a poor prognosis. The frequency of pulmonary complications was higher among older patients and those who developed moderate rejection in the first month (P=.014 and P=.036, respectively). Pulmonary infections after heart transplantation occurred more frequently during the first 6 months posttransplantation, accounting for a significant portion of the posttransplantation mortality.
