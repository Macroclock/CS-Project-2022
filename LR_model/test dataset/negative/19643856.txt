Surgical repair of mitral and tricuspid valves after cardiac transplantation. A 43-year-old man underwent mitral valve repair for mitral valve insufficiency due to infective endocarditis, and tricuspid valve repair for iatrogenic chordal rupture due to multiple endomyocardial biopsies after orthotopic cardiac transplantation. Valve repair using no artificial material is feasible, instead of valve replacement, to decrease the risk of recurrent infective endocarditis and enable further biopsies.
