Effect of Desmopressin on the Amount of Bleeding and Transfusion Requirements in Patients Undergoing Heart Transplant Surgery. One of the most common risks after a heart transplant is bleeding. In this study, the effect of desmopressin administration on the amount of bleeding and transfusion requirements after heart transplant surgery was investigated. In a double-blind clinical trial, 48 patients who were candidates for heart transplant surgery were randomly assigned to two groups. In the intervention group, patients received desmopressin of 0.3 Î¼g/kg, 30 min. before surgery. Patients in the control group received normal saline at the same amount and time. Homeostasis was evaluated using activated clotting time (ACT), PT, PTT and PLT before, 12 and 24 hr after surgery, and also, chest tube drainage, blood products transfusion requirements during the first day in both groups. No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of ACT, PT, PTT and PLT at all times. Transfusion of packed red blood cells and the mean drainages of chest tube during the first 24 hr after surgery were significantly lower in the desmopressin group compared to the saline group. Desmopressin may reduce post-operative bleeding in patients undergoing heart transplant surgery. Further studies are required to confirm the potential effect of desmopressin on establishing haemostasis after heart transplantation.
