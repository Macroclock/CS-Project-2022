Impact of pretransplant antibodies on outcomes after heart transplantation. Since the discovery of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in the 1950s, there has been great interest in the role of antibodies in posttransplant rejection. The development of the lymphocyte toxicity test by Terasaki et al. in the 1960s was the first step toward understanding the role of antibodies in posttransplant rejection. Subsequently, various organs have been transplanted and improving posttransplant outcomes have become a focus of research. In particular, methods to measure antibodies that affect posttransplant outcomes, including anti-HLA antibodies, and methods to desensitize patients from specific antibodies have been explored. One recent method for measuring antibodies is called the solid-phase assay, which uses purified HLA fixed to microbeads. This assay does not use donor lymphocytes and allows clinicians to test the reactivity of patient serum against a panel of antibodies. It has also enabled the identification of specific anti-HLA antibodies using a single HLA. In addition to advances in methods to measure and analyze anti-HLA antibodies, the clinical impact of non-HLA antibodies has also received much attention recently.
