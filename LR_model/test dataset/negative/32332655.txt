One-year follow-up of heart transplant recipient with cardiac rehabilitation: A case report. Heart transplantation (HT) is known to be the final therapy for patients with advanced heart failure; however, the exercise capacity of these patients remains under the aged-predicted value after HT. Many studies have described the effectiveness and safety of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in HT recipients. Nevertheless, long-term follow-up data of HT recipients undergoing CR are insufficient, and there is a lack of evidence on the long-term effects of CR. In this case report, we present the long-term benefits of CR in an HT recipient, including serial follow-up clinical data over 1 year. A 48-year-old female patient underwent HT because of advanced dilated cardiomyopathy. Cardiopulmonary exercise test showed reduced exercise capacity and pulmonary function. The grip power and quadriceps muscle strength were also decreased after HT. The patient underwent a phase I CR program for 3 months, followed by a phase III CR program for 7 months. In the beginning, moderate-intensity continuous training was conducted. Thereafter, high-intensity interval training was implemented after a period of adjustment for interval training. The exercise capacity, 6-min walk distance, muscle strength, and vital capacity were improved after CR. CR in HT recipients may improve muscle strength and pulmonary function as well as exercise capacity, without serious cardiovascular complications. Phase III CR may help maintain exercise capacity in these patients.
