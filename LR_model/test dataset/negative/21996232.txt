Health behavior of patients after heart transplantation as an indicator of patient compliance. Life after heart transplantation (HTX) does not only mean adherence to medical recommendations, but also implementation of healthy habits each day. It is necessary to change health-related customs, diet, and lifestyle, as well as to maintain a high standard of hygiene. Some patients make the necessary lifestyle modifications prior to surgery, as a result of pre-heart failure conditions, such as coronary heart disease or hypertension or diabetes. People who suddenly fall ill must make these changes immediately after the operation. The transplantation team working with patients after HTX since 1988 performs a program of secondary prophylaxis. Patients work with a physician, psychologist, physiotherapist, nursing team, and dietitian. The program is based on the processual model of health behavior Health Action Process Approach by Ralf Schwarzer. The goal of the study was to describe and assess compliance to a healthy lifestyle among patients living with a heart transplant. The study was conducted using the Health Behavior Inventory developed and standardized by Z. Juczy≈Ñski. The scale examined three types of behavior lowering/raising the risk of illness as associated with compliance to medical recommendations, maintaining health, and reducing disease risk. Participants included 100 HTX patients including 23 women and 77 men of overall age range 21-75 years (average=53.5). The results are as follows: General indicator of health behaviors--7.3 sten. Subscales: proper nutrition habits--3.5; prophylactic behavior--4.1; positive psychological attitude--3 health practices--3.8. Heart transplant patients require professional, interdisciplinary assistance to shape healthy behaviors with motivational and volitional phases. Patients who follow medical recommendations experience a much better quality of life, protecting the new heart from negative effects of bad habits.
