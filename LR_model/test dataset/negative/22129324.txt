A child with BK virus infection: inadequacy of current therapeutic strategies. In this report, we describe the development of BKVN in the native kidneys of a child with a cardiac transplant. Elevated BK viral DNA load by PCR necessitated a prolonged course of treatment with escalating doses of cidofovir. Despite a reduction in plasma BK viral load, the infection evolved into an invasive CNS disease, resulting in rhomboencephalitis. This case highlights the need for awareness of the possibility of developing multiorgan complications from BKV infection. The current treatment options for BKV tissue invasive disease are inadequate and need to be improved.
