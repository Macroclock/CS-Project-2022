[Technique of implantation and experience with temporary mechanical cardiac support in right ventricular failure]. Severe right heart failure remains unfrequent but fatal complication of cardiac surgical procedures. Implantation of temporary right ventricular assist device may be life-saving procedure in various situations of right heart failure as: heart transplantation, LVAD therapy and post-cardiotomy failure. The aim of the study is an introduction of the implantation technique and retrospective review of current experience with the method. Since January 2007 isolated right ventricular assist device Levitronix CentriMag has been implanted in 16 patients. Patients were divided into 3 groups: post transplantation (post-Tx), post LVAD implantation (post-LVAD) and other cardiac procedures (OCP). Success rate of weaning from RVAD, 30-days mortality and major complications has been assessed. Distribution of implants in groups was: post-Tx 5 pts (31%), post-LVAD 6 pts (38%) and 5 in OCP group (31%). The mean support time was 12 days. Off-pump implantation was achieved in 9 pts. The device was successfully weaned in 13 (81%) patients. 30-days mortality occurred in 1 case only. Presented outcomes are encouraging for broader acceptance of the therapy. Excellent success rate has been reached in post-Tx and post-LVAD. This study emphasises decesive role of proactive approach in early indication of RVAD implantation for achieving satisfactory results.
