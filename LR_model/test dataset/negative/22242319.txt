[Strategy of surgical treatment for ischemic heart disease]. The efficacy of regenerative cell therapy as strategy of cardiac functional recovery in patients with end-stage heart failure has been recently reported, and clinical applications of autologous skeletal myoblast cell transplantation has been already started in Europe and U.S. We developed cell-sheet technology with a temperature-responsive culture dish, which enabled cell-to-cell junction to retain, and started a clinical study of cardiac regenerative therapy using autologous skeletal myoblast cell sheet implantation.
