A modified splint tubing technique for heterotopic heart transplantation in mouse. The complexity of surgical procedure in mouse heterotopic heart transplantation (HHT) has prevented its widespread use. The present study reported a modified technique - splint tubing technique (STT) based on cuff technique (CT). C57BL/10 and BALB/c mice were performed in syngeneic and allogeneic HHT using STT and CT. The main improvement is that the recipient external jugular vein and common carotid artery were independently opened a mouth and inserted a cannula to avoid the difficult operations of sleeved and everted tube. Graft function was assessed by pulse palpation, echocardiography and histopathologic examination. Ten syngeneic and thirty allogeneic HHT using STT were performed with six graft losses. Ten allogeneic HHT using CT were carried out with two graft losses. Technically successful syngeneic grafts have survived to the pre-specified 30days endpoint with strong contraction. STT significantly shortened operation time compared with CT (32.33±4.21min vs 45.15±4.89min, P<0.05). No significant difference was observed in survival time between two methods. STT is easily learned. It reduces the operation difficulty and makes the operation possible for the beginner to master this skill within 1-2weeks. Shorter operation time leads higher operative success rate.
