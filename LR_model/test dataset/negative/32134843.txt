The Application of Next-generation Sequencing Tumor Molecular Profiling in the Diagnosis and Management of a Case of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia With MLL-PTD in a Pediatric Heart Transplant Recipient. A 6-year-old girl with a history of heart transplantation was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome, which progressed to acute myelogenous leukemia. Comprehensive genomic profiling of her tumor discovered an MLL-PTD (partial tandem duplication) and she received chemotherapy and a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). She subsequently relapsed and tumor molecular profiling was repeated, revealing 2 new potentially targetable mutations (FLT3 and IDH2). A novel treatment regimen targeting these mutations with sorafenib and azacitidine without using cytotoxic chemotherapy produced remission and she subsequently pursued a second HSCT. She remains disease-free 17 months after HSCT. This case report demonstrates how repeated tumor molecular profiling provided novel actionable information for the diagnosis and management at 2 timepoints.
