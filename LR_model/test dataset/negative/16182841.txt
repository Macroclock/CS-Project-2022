Peripheral extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients with posttransplant cardiac graft failure. We sought to report the usefulness of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in heart transplant patients. Between March 2002 and August 2004, 14 heart transplant patients (11 men and three women, 36 +/- 15 years old, range = 12 to 50) with primary graft failure underwent peripheral ECMO implantation. Three patients had pulmonary hypertension and three had been transplanted with hearts from marginal donors. At the time of implantation, all were in severe cardiogenic shock despite maximal inotropic support. In six patients, the ECMO was implanted in the operating room since cardiopulmonary bypass could not be weaned. In the eight remaining patients, ECMO was implanted in the intensive care unit, during the first 48 hours in seven cases. In one patient, implantation was performed during external resuscitation. In all cases, femoral vessels were canulated using the Seldinger technique after anterior wall exposure. Distal arterial perfusion of the lower limb was systematically used. Pump outflow was high enough in all the cases (mean: 2.6 +/- 0.2 L/min/m(2)). Three patients died on circulatory support. One patient was implanted with a total artificial heart after a few hours and another one underwent unsuccessful emergent retransplantation. Nine patients were weaned from ECMO after a mean duration of 5 +/- 2.5 days. Among them, one died of infection at 10 days after weaning and seven others were discharged to rehabilitation centers. Fast operating room or bedside implantation of a peripheral ECMO allows the physician to stabilize the hemodynamic status of patients with cardiac graft failure, potentially leading toward myocardial recovery.
