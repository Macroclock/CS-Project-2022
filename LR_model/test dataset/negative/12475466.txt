Delisting of infants and children from the heart transplantation waiting list after carvedilol treatment. We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of carvedilol effects in children with severe, chronic heart failure (HF), despite the use of conventional therapy. Little is known about the effects of carvedilol in youngsters with chronic HF and severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 22 consecutive children with severe LV dysfunction. The children had chronic HF and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <30%. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (8 patients) or the beta-blocker carvedilol (14 patients) at 0.01 mg/kg/day titrated up to 0.2 mg/kg/day, followed-up for six months. During the follow-up and the up-titration period in the carvedilol group, four patients died and one underwent heart transplantation. In patients receiving carvedilol evaluated after six months, a significant increase occurred in LVEF, from 17.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.1 to 21.4%) to 34.6% (95% CI, 25.2 to 44.0%); p = 0.001. Modified New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class improved in nine patients taken off the transplant waiting list. All nine patients were alive at follow-up. In the placebo group, during the six-month follow-up, two patients died, and two underwent heart transplantation. Four patients persisted with HF symptoms (NYHA functional class IV). No significant change occurred in LVEF or fractional shortening. Carvedilol added to standard therapy may reduce HF progression and improve cardiac function, allowing some youngsters to be removed from the heart transplantation waiting list.
