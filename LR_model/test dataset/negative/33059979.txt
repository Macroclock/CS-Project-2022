Noninvasive Assessment of Cardiac Output in Advanced Heart Failure and Heart Transplant Candidates Using the Bioreactance Method. The aim of the present study was to assess the validity and trending ability of the bioreactance method in estimating cardiac output at rest and in response to stress in advanced heart failure patients and heart transplant candidates. This was a prospective single-center study. This study was conducted at the heart transplant center at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. Eighteen patients with advanced chronic heart failure due to reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (19 ± 7%), and peak oxygen consumption 12.3 ± 3.9 mL/kg/min. Participants underwent right heart catheterization using the Swan-Ganz catheter. Cardiac output was measured simultaneously using thermodilution and bioreactance at rest and during active straight leg raise test to volitional exertion. There was no significant difference in cardiac index values obtained by the thermodilution and bioreactance methods (2.26 ± 0.59 v 2.38 ± 0.50 L/min, p > 0.05) at rest and peak straight leg raise test (2.92 ± 0.77 v 3.01 ± 0.66 L/min, p > 0.05). In response to active leg raise test, thermodilution cardiac output increased by 22% and bioreactance by 21%. There was also a strong relationship between cardiac outputs from both methods at rest (r = 0.88, p < 0.01) and peak straight leg raise test (r = 0.92, p < 0.01). Cartesian plot analysis showed good trending ability of bioreactance compared with thermodilution (concordance rate = 93%) CONCLUSIONS: `Cardiac output measured by the bioreactance method is comparable to that from the thermodilution method. Bioreactance method may be used in clinical practice to assess hemodynamics and improve management of advanced heart failure patients undergoing heart transplant assessment.
