[Peripartum cardiomyopathy: a rare, unknown and potentially fatal disease]. Peripartum cardiomyopathy occurs in women with no prior history of cardiac dysfunction, and is presented by left heart failure. It occurs late in pregnancy or in the months after delivery. Rare in Europe, it is not well-known by obstetricians. The prognosis can be good with restitutio in integrum of the maternal cardiac function but the outcome can be dramatic and lead to death of the patient as the case in this report.
