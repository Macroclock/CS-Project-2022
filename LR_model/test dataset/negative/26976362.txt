Low-Dose Valacyclovir for Cytomegalovirus Infection Prophylaxis After a Heart Transplant. Cytomegalovirus infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in solid-organ transplant. Low doses of valacyclovir have been administered as cytomegalovirus prophylaxis in our institution for years. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published study of a low-dose regimen for cytomegalovirus prophylaxis in heart transplant patients. Therefore, our aim was to determine the results of low doses of valacyclovir in heart transplant. Between September 2006 and December 2014, sixty-eight patients underwent orthotopic heart transplants. All of the patients received triple immunosuppressive therapy after surgery. During the next 6 months, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was administered for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, and toxoplasmosis. Additionally all patients received valacyclovir hydrochloride (1000 mg/d, oral) for cytomegalovirus prophylaxis and nystatin oral rinse for prophylaxis of fungal infections. There was only 1 cytomegalovirus infection at follow-up. The patient had cytomegalovirus pneumonia at 17-month follow-up. In response to treatment with 1-week intravenous ganciclovir, the patient was discharged with a further 6-month oral valacyclovir therapy (1000 mg/d). In this study, we hypothesized that daily use of low-dose valacyclovir (1000 mg/d) is not only sufficient for cytomegalovirus prophylaxis but also beneficial in terms of cost.
