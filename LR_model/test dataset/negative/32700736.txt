Transfusion Requirements and Blood Bank Support in Heart and Lung Transplantation. Transplantations may require massive transfusion of blood products. Therefore, blood banks need to predict, prepare, and supply the required amount of blood products. We measured the volume of transfused blood components as red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate in 54 and 89 patients who received heart and lung transplantation, respectively, in our hospital between January 2012 and December 2019. Platelets were the most frequently transfused blood component. Transfusion volumes during heart and lung transplantation surgeries differed: red blood cells, 7.83 units vs 14.84 units; fresh frozen plasma, 2.67 units vs 12.29 units; platelets, 13.13 units vs 23.63 units; and cryoprecipitate, 1.74 units vs 2.57 units; respectively. The average transfusion volume of transplants was different each year. Periodic evaluation of transfusion requirements will facilitate the efficient management of blood products at the time of transplantation and help blood banks predict changes in blood requirements.
