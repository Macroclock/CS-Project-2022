Outcomes of heart transplantation from hepatitis C virus-positive donors. National data demonstrate that increasing opportunities exist for organ donation among hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected individuals. We developed a clinical practice protocol for the acceptance of HCV+ organs for HCV- patients who underwent heart transplantation (HT) and retrospectively reviewed the outcomes at our institution. Inclusion criteria were as follows: all adult patients listed for HT. Exclusion criteria were as follows: pre-existing HIV or active hepatitis B viremia in the recipient/donor. We transplanted 21 patients from HCV+ donors. Nineteen were viremic donors, and 2 were non-viremic donors. The recipients included 18 patients who underwent HT alone, and 3 patients who underwent combined heart-kidney transplants. There was no HCV transmission from the non-viremic donors (n = 2). All 19 recipients of the viremic donors developed HCV infection (100% transmission). The median age of the viremic donors was 34 years (interquartile range 30-46), and 84.2% were considered US Public Health Service-increased risk. Induction immunosuppression consisted of anti-thymocyte globulin (7/21), basiliximab (7/21), or none (8/21). Maintenance immunosuppression comprised tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. Post-operative Week 2 HCV viral load was not related to induction. Direct anti-viral agent (DAA) therapy for a 12-week course consisted of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (14/19, 74%), sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (2/19, 11%), elbasvir/grazoprevir (2/19, 11%), and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (1/19, 5%). All the patients on DAA therapy cleared viremia. The sustained virological response rate at 12 weeks in 18 evaluable patients was 100%. We report successful single-center experience using HCV+ organs for HT into HCV- recipients. We believe that there is utility in using such organs to expand the current donor pool. Further long-term follow-up is needed. 'HCV NAT', 'HCV viremic donor', 'heart transplant', 'hepatitis C infection', 'hepatitis C virus (HCV)'
