Resection of the ascending aorta and aortic valve patch closure for type A aortic dissection after Novacor LVAD insertion. A 60-year-old patient developed an acute type A aortic dissection in the postoperative course of a Novacor left ventricular assist device. We performed a resection of the ascending aorta with an aortic valve patch closure, end-to-end anastomosis of the outflow graft to the distal ascending aorta and two venous grafts to the coronary arteries, in order to avoid residual aortic insufficiency and bleeding related to exposure of the fragilized tissues to high pressures.
