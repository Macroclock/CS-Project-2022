Prognostic Value of Serum Lactate Levels in Patients Undergoing Urgent Heart Transplant: A Subanalysis of the ASIS-TC Spanish Multicenter Study. To study the prognostic value of serum lactate in patients under temporary preoperative mechanical circulatory support who underwent urgent heart transplant. We conducted a subanalysis of a Spanish multicenter registry recording data on patients under temporary mechanical circulatory support listed for highly urgent heart transplant from 2010 to 2015. Participants selected for the present study were those who received a transplant and who had known preoperative serum lactate levels. The main study outcome was 1-year survival after transplant. A total of 177 heart transplant recipients were studied; preoperatively, 90 were supported on venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 51 on temporary left ventricular assist devices, and 36 on temporary biventricular assist devices. Preoperative hyperlactatemia (≥ 2 mmol/L) was present in 44 (25%) patients. On multivariable analysis, pretransplant serum lactate was identified as an independent predictor of 1-year posttransplant survival (adjusted HR per 0.1 mmol/L, 1.02; 95%CI, 1.01-1.03; P = .007). One-year posttransplant survival was 53.1% (95%CI, 45.3-60.9) in patients with preoperative hyperlactatemia and 75.6% (95%CI, 71.8-79.4) in those without preoperative hyperlactatemia (adjusted HR, 1.94; 95%CI, 1.04-3.63; P = .039). Preoperative hyperlactatemia correlated with adverse outcomes in patients supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, but not in patients supported on ventricular assist devices. Preoperative serum lactate is a strong independent predictor of worse outcomes in patients undergoing urgent heart transplant on short-term mechanical circulatory support.
