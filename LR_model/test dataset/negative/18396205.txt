Positive association of anticytoskeletal endothelial cell antibodies and cardiac allograft rejection. Using an indirect immunofluorescence method on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), we investigated the presence of antiendothelial cell antibodies (AECA) in 136 pre- and posttransplant serum samples sequentially collected from 31 patients during the first year after cardiac transplantation. A healthy control group was also included (n = 87). Colocalization studies demonstrated a positive staining pattern of different cytoskeletal components (cytoskeletal-antiendothelial cell antibodies, CSK-AECA) including antivimentin, antiactin, antitubulin, and anticytokeratin among heart transplanted patients. Frequency of CSK-AECA in the control group and at day 0 in the transplant group was 18.3 and 22.5%, respectively (p = NS). A progressive increase in the frequency of CSK-AECA was observed after cardiac transplantation: 13.3% at day 15; 22.2% at day 30; 53.8% at day 90, and 58% at day 360. Interestingly, rejection episodes within the first year after transplantation occurred in 83.3% of CSK-AECA-positive and in 30.7% of CSK-AECA-negative patients (p = 0.0045). The presence of antibodies was detected prior to the rejection event and was associated with a poor clinical outcome: rejection episodes occurred at a mean of 36.14 +/- 17 days after transplantation in patients with preexisting AECA and 174.25 +/- 51.9 days after de novo antibody appearance in patients with no antibodies at day 0 (p = 0.029). In conclusion, a progressive increase in the frequency of CSK-AECA was observed following cardiac transplantation; the presence of these antibodies is strongly associated and precedes the rejection episodes. Thus, CSK-AECA could be a good marker for acute graft rejection.
