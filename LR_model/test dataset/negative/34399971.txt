A Rare Case of Disseminated Tuberculosis and Hematological Malignancy in a Heart Transplant Recipient. A 77-year-old man who underwent a heart transplant 7 years ago presented with multiple bloody bowel movements. Endoscopic and histologic evaluation revealed chronic active ileitis, granulomatous inflammation, multinucleated giant cells, and a rare, equivocal acid-fast bacterium in the terminal ileum. Positive sputum cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and acid-fast bacilli established a diagnosis of intestinal tuberculosis, and RIPE (rifabutin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) therapy was initiated. Elevated IgG levels on quantitative immunoglobulin testing and a bone marrow biopsy specimen of â‰¥60% plasma cells confirmed the diagnosis of multiple myeloma that later transformed into its aggressive form, plasma cell leukemia. Induction chemotherapy was initiated; however, the patient experienced retroperitoneal bleeding and pancytopenias, limiting the continuation of chemotherapy, and as a result, the patient was transitioned to palliative care.
