An approach to LVAD explantation during heart transplantation. Reoperations during ventricular assist device (VAD) explantation and subsequent heart transplantation are difficult procedures because of dense adhesions, obliterated planes of dissection, and proximity of the right ventricle to the sternum. We present our approach for left VAD explantation to minimize potential complications that may occur during this procedure.
