Multiple atypical fibroxanthomas in a cardiac transplant recipient. Solid organ transplant recipients have an increased incidence of multiple cutaneous neoplasms. We hope to draw attention to the potential risk for organ transplant recipients to develop atypical fibroxanthomas. A review of the patient's medical record was performed and summarized as a case report. We present the case of a cardiac transplant recipient who developed three atypical fibroxanthomas. This is the first reported case of multiple atypical fibroxanthomas in an organ transplant recipient. Atypical fibroxanthomas are uncommon cutaneous malignancies for which transplant recipients may be at increased risk.
