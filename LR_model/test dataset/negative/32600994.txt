Impact of donor-recipient age on cardiac transplant survival. Subanalysis of the Spanish Heart Transplant Registry. The age of heart transplant recipients and donors is progressively increasing. It is likely that not all donor-recipient age combinations have the same impact on mortality. The objective of this work was to compare survival in transplant recipients according to donor-recipient age combinations. We performed a retrospective analysis of transplants performed between 1 January 1993 and 31 December 2017 in the Spanish Heart Transplant Registry. Pediatric transplants, retransplants and combined transplants were excluded (6505 transplants included). Four groups were considered: a) donor <50 years for recipient <65 years; b) donor <50 years for recipient ≥ 65 years; c) donor ≥ 50 years for recipient ≥ 65 years, and d) donor ≥ 50 years for recipient <65 years. The most frequent group was young donor for young recipient (73%). There were differences in the median survival between the groups (P <.001): a) younger-younger: 12.1 years, 95%CI, 11.5-12.6; b) younger-older: 9.1 years, 95%CI, 8.0-10.5; c) older-older: 7.5 years, 95%CI, 2.8-11.0; d) older-younger: 10.5 years, 95%CI, 9.6-12.1. On multivariate analysis, independent predictors of mortality were the age of the donor and the recipient (0.008 and 0.001, respectively). The worst combinations were older-older vs younger-younger (HR, 1.57; 95%CI, 1.22-2.01; P <.001) and younger-older vs younger-younger (HR, 1.33; 95%CI, 1.12-1.58; P=.001). Age (of the donor and recipient) is a relevant prognostic factor in heart transplant. The donor-recipient age combination has prognostic implications that should be identified when accepting an organ for transplant.
