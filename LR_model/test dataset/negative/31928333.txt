Heart Transplantation After Ventricular Assist Device Therapy: Benefits, Risks, and Outcomes. Heart transplantation is an established treatment for end-stage heart failure. Due to the increase in demand and persistent scarcity of organ, mechanical circulatory devices have played a major role in therapy for advanced heart failure. Usage of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has gone up from 6% in 2006 to 43% in 2013 as per the United Network of Organ Sharing database. Majority of patients presenting for a heart transplantation are often bridged with an assist device prior for management of heart failure while on wait-list. On one hand, it is well established that LVADs improve survival on wait-list; on the other hand, the effect of LVAD on morbidity and survival after a heart transplantation is still unclear. In this article, we review the available literature and attempt to infer the outcomes given the risks and benefits of heart transplantation with prior LVAD patients.
