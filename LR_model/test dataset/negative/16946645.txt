Surgical correction of developmental scoliosis following cardiac transplantation: case report. Case report. To present a pediatric patient who underwent successful 2-stage anterior and posterior scoliosis surgery 20 months after cardiac transplantation. Cardiac transplantation has increased the life expectancy in children with end-stage cardiac failure caused by congenital heart disease or cardiomyopathy. Scoliosis is commonly associated with congenital cardiac disease. Previous reports have suggested that anterior scoliosis surgery is contraindicated after heart transplantation. We describe the case of a 13-year-old patient who underwent staged anterior and posterior spinal arthrodesis to correct a severe thoracic developmental scoliosis. The 2 procedures were performed 1 week apart. Following the first stage, pulmonary edema had developed, which required reintubation and administration of diuretics. Significant blood loss occurred during the posterior spinal fusion. The patient had a satisfactory correction of her scoliosis and made a good recovery. Three years after surgery, she had no complaints of her back and had a solid spinal fusion. Elective anterior and posterior spinal arthrodesis can be safely performed in cardiac transplant recipients with severe developmental scoliosis. This procedure can achieve optimum correction of the curvature and a successful outcome without long-term medical or technical complications.
