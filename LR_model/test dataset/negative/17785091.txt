[Experience in treatment of Eisenmenger's syndrome by heart-lung transplantation]. To summarize the experience in treatment of Eisenmenger's syndrome by heart-lung transplantation (HLT). Two cases of congenital heart disease with Eisenmenger's syndrome, aged 20 and 22, underwent bicaval orthotopic HLT. Modified St. Thomas cardioplegic solution and modified LPD solution were used to preserve the donor heart and lung. After removing the heart and lung of the recipient and thorough hemostasis in thoracic cavity and mediastinal septum, the donor heart and lung was implanted, and trachea, superior/inferior vena cava and aortic artery were anastomosed gradually. Intensive care against infection, rejection and other complications were performed after operation. The operations were successful. Tracheal anastomotic stenosis happened in one case seven months after HLT and was cured by sleeve resection of the stenosed trachea segment. Acute rejection happened in one case 10 days after HLT and was cured by stoss therapy. Both patients recovered to normal life and work. The success of HLT is related to perfect organ preservation, precise surgical performance and proper peri-operative treatment.
