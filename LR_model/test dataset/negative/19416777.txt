Relationship of hormonal resuscitation therapy and central venous pressure on increasing organs for transplant. Hormonal resuscitation therapy (HRT) has been shown to increase the number of organs available for transplant. Likewise, optimal fluid balance, as measured by central venous pressure (CVP), impacts the function of donor lungs. The purpose of this study is to examine the interplay of these two variables in donor management and the impact they have on organs transplanted, with particular emphasis on hearts and lungs. Management of brain-dead potential organ donors was standardized in the regional OPO, including utilization of HRT in combination with a goal CVP of 4 to 8 mm Hg. Outcomes of organs transplanted per donor (OTPD) were compared between donors receiving > or =15 hours and <15 hours of L-thyroxine (T4); between donors with a final CVP <10 mm Hg vs >10 mm Hg; between donors in whom T4 was applied for > or =15 hours, and a final CVP <10 mm Hg was achieved; and those in whom one or both variables were not achieved. Seventy-nine percent more hearts were transplanted from donors in whom HRT was initiated and maintained for > or =15 hours. When a final CVP <10 mm Hg was achieved, 44% more hearts, 95% more lungs and 13% more kidneys were able to be transplanted. When both variables were met, 64% more hearts, 103% more lungs, 6% more kidneys and 44% more pancreata were available for transplantation, without compromise of liver or intestinal outcomes. Standardization of HRT, in combination with a CVP <10 mm Hg, significantly increases the utilization of hearts and lungs for transplantation, without negatively impacting other organ systems.
