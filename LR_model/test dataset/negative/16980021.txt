Single-center experience of pediatric heart transplantation in taiwan. Heart transplantation (HTx) is a treatment for end-stage heart failure or a complex or inoperable congenital defect. The long-term survival and the adequate donor to recipient body weight (D/R BW) ratio remain to be determined. From March 1995 to May 2004, 14 children (6 months-16 years of age) underwent HTx due to underlying diseases of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 10; 71.4%), congenital heart disease (n = 3; 21.4%), and Kawasaki disease (n = 1; 7.1%). Donor-recipient body weight ratio ranged from 0.89 to 3.9. Big heart syndrome was present in one patient when D/R BW ratio was more than 3. Actuarial survival was 92.9% at 5 years after transplantation. Only the one patient who had Kawasaki disease died due to early primary graft failure. HTx is a feasible method with good long-term survival rates for end-stage heart failure or for complex or inoperable congenital defects. After careful pretransplant evaluation, a high D/R BW ratio (more than 3) is acceptable.
