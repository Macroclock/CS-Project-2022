Patients' perceived care needs whilst waiting for a heart or lung transplant. To explore the perceptions of caring and expectations of nursing care in patients on a heart and/or lung transplant waiting list. The waiting period for a heart or lung transplant can be very stressful and demanding for patients and their families. Care during the waiting period needs to be aimed at treating the symptoms and complications of patients' underlying condition and also specific issues related to organ transplant candidacy. A qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews with 22 patients on a heart and/or lung transplant waiting list was used. Participants were interviewed on three separate occasions. Qualitative analysis of the data revealed five major themes related to the nursing care needs of heart and lung transplant candidates. The themes were identified as information giving, maintenance of regular contact, familiarity, positive thinking and compassionate manner. These were five key aspects of communication within the nurse-patient relationship and formed the essence of caring as perceived by patients awaiting heart and/or lung transplantation. Transplant candidates often experience prolonged waiting times for a transplant which is often laden with uncertainties and stress. This study provided an in-depth description of patients' perceptions of caring and their nursing care needs whilst on a heart and lung transplant waiting list. The findings provide useful advice to nurses about ways they can improve care and enhance caring for patients waiting for an organ transplant. Key elements of nursing care that foster the nurse-patient relationship that can be incorporated into nursing care pathways have been highlighted.
