Psychosocial predictors of medication adherence in pediatric heart and lung organ transplantation. Few studies have identified the psychosocial characteristics of those children and their families associated with future non-adherence to immunosuppressive medications following a heart or lung transplant. UNOS data and medical records information were used to test the association between patient and family psychosocial characteristics and medication adherence. Medication adherence outcomes were obtained using the physician assessments in the UNOS data and measured through patient-level standard deviation scores of immunosuppressive medication blood levels. Complete data were collected on 105 pediatric heart and lung transplant recipients and their families. Multivariate, stepwise analyses were conducted with each adherence outcome. Physician reports of adherence were associated with age of the child at transplantation, parental education, two-parent families, significant psychosocial problems, and the pretransplant life support status of the child. The resulting model (Ï‡ 'adolescent', 'heart transplant', 'lung transplant', 'non-adherence', 'pediatric', 'psychosocial factors', 'transplant immunosuppression'
