Pregnancy and heart-lung transplantation. The purpose of this study was to report a single center's experience of 5 new pregnancies following heart-lung transplantation. These 5 pregnancies gave rise to 4 live births. Vaginal delivery occurred at a mean of 38 +/- 1 weeks of amenorrhea (range, 37-39 weeks) and the mean birth weight was 3,143 +/- 757 grams (range, 2,270-3,990 grams). Mean maternal forced expiratory volume in 1 second (%) before, during (sixth month), and after (1 year) pregnancy was 87 +/- 18, 87 +/- 22, and 88 +/- 17, respectively (p = NS). In conclusion, pregnancy after heart-lung transplantation can be associated with a good prognosis for mother and child.
