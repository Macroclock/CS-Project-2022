Mechanical circulatory support and heart transplantation in the Asia Pacific region. Globalization has resulted in epidemiologic transition in developing countries from infectious disease and nutritional deficiencies to non-communicable diseases. Epidemiologic data on heart failure (HF), particularly advanced HF therapy, in Asia are increasingly becoming available, although they remain sparse. Heart transplantation for advanced stage HF remains very low in Asia-approximately 0.075 heart transplants per 1 million population. North America, which comprises 7.5% of the world population, accounted for 55.8% of transplants recorded in the 2012 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) Registry, whereas Asia, with 62.5% of the world population, accounted for 5.7% of transplants. There is also lack of reporting from heart transplant centers in Asia to the ISHLT Registry. Most transplant programs in Asia are in economically stable South East Asian countries, whereas in other parts of developing countries, the cost and health care infrastructures remain prohibitive for the development of these programs. Multi-cultural and racial factors, religious beliefs, and diverse traditions of many centuries have resulted in reluctance to organ donation. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is emerging as a viable alternative to transplantation, but despite technical capabilities, limitations in embracing MCS in Asia exist. Discrepant practices in the reimbursement of costly MCS therapy have led to differences in the availability of these devices to patients in the region. The HeartMate II (St. Jude Medical, Inc, St. Paul, MN) left ventricular assist device is currently the most widely used durable device in Asia, whereas the HeartWare HVAD (HeartWare, Inc, Framingham, MA) is used most often in Australia. By September 9, 2015, 341 HeartMate implants (293 as bridge to transplant and 48 as destination therapy) had been performed, of which 180 implants were in Japan. The overall 4-year survival is 88%. The longest duration of support is 6.5 years. By the end of 2015, 243 HeartWare HVADs had been implanted in Asia Pacific. There is a need for focused efforts at improving the reporting of data and intensifying health policy within the region to advocate organ transplantation. Individual governments need to take national responsibility to fulfill organ donation and transplantation needs of their populations. International collaboratives, coordinated by societies such as the ISHLT, will be essential in moving this field forward in Asia Pacific.
