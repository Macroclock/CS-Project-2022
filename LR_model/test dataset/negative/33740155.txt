Left thoracotomy vs full sternotomy for centrifugal durable LVAD implantation: 1-year outcome comparison post-LVAD and post-heart transplantation. Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantations have traditionally been approached through a full median sternotomy (FS). Recently, a minimally invasive left thoracotomy (LT) approach has been popularized. This study sought to compare the outcomes of FS and LT patients post-primary LVAD implantation and post-subsequent heart transplant (HT). This was a single-center retrospective study. 83 patients who underwent primary centrifugal durable LVAD implantation from January 2014 to June 2018 were included (FS, n = 41; LT, n = 42). 41 patients had a subsequent HT (FS, n = 19; LT, n = 22). Pre-operative patient demographics, intraoperative variables, post-operative 1-year survival, length of hospital stay, complications, and outcomes for LVAD implantation and following HT were analyzed. Intraoperative data showed that the LT group had a 23.4% longer mean LVAD implant surgical time (p < 0.01). One-year post-LVAD survival was similar between the two groups (p = 0.05). Complication rates, with the exception of the rate of hemorrhagic stroke (p = 0.04) post-LVAD implant were similar. One-year survival post-HT was similar between groups (p = 0.35). Complication rates and mean length of hospital stay were also similar (p = 1.0) post-HT. Our study demonstrated that LT approach does not negatively affect post-LVAD implantation or post-HT outcomes. Further, larger studies may determine more detailed effects of LT approach. 'Heart failure', 'Heart transplant', 'Left ventricular assist device', 'Surgical approach'
