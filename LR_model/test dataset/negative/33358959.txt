Bariatric Surgery in Patients with Obesity and Ventricular Assist Devices Considered for Heart Transplantation: Systematic Review and Individual Participant Data Meta-analysis. Class II obesity (body mass index BMI ≥35 kg/m We conducted a systematic search in ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, Google Scholar, and most relevant bariatric and heart failure journals. We extracted baseline and outcome individual participant data for every ventricular assist device patient undergoing BS with reported postoperative BMI and their respective timepoints when BMI data were measured. Fourteen references with 29 patients were included. The mean age was 41.9 ± 12.2 years, 82.8% underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, and 39.3% had reported perioperative adverse events. The mean pre-BS BMI was 45.5 ± 6.6 kg/m BS may help patients with obesity and ventricular assist devices to lose a significant amount of weight and improve their candidacy for HT or even achieve myocardial recovery.
