Effect of the immunosuppressive regimen on the incidence of cytomegalovirus infection in 378 heart transplant recipients: A single centre, prospective cohort study. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a major complication of immunosuppression after heart transplant. Recent studies suggest the actual immunosuppressive regimen may affect the risk of CMV infection. To evaluate incidence, risk factors and clinical consequences of CMV infection and assess the possible differential effect of distinct immunosuppressive protocols. Single centre, prospective cohort study of 378 consecutive heart transplant recipients undergoing CMV monitoring. Preemptive treatment was the standard of care. Patients were grouped as follows: group A, without any CMV infection; group B, with CMV infection not requiring pre-emptive treatment; group C, treated for CMV infection or disease. Most recipients never required antiviral therapy because of no CMV infection/disease (group A, 31%) or CMV levels below the cut-off for pre-emptive treatment (group B, 28%). Group C recipients (41%) were significantly older than group A patients (49.1±13.2 vs. 44.8±15.1 years; p=0.028). Most cases occurred within the second month post-transplant. CMV viremia was detected in 77% and 62% of patients primed with thymoglobulin or ATG Fresenius, respectively, (OR 2.06, 95% C.I. 1.27-3.34; p=0.0034). Use of everolimus was associated with a significantly lower rate of CMV infection compared to azathioprine or mycophenolate (OR 0.19, 95% C.I. 0.09-0.39; p<0.0001). Major opportunistic infections were significantly more common in groups B and C. In a large and homogeneous cohort of heart transplant recipients, we observed a strong relationship between the immune suppressive regimen and CMV infection, as well as an increased incidence of other opportunistic infections in recipients with CMV infection/disease.
