Combined heart-kidney transplantation: the University of Wisconsin experience. Combined heart-kidney transplantation (HKTx) is increasing in frequency, but long-term outcomes are unknown and appropriately comparative analysis is lacking. This study was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data for 19 HKTx patients. Patient and graft survival, graft rejection and coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) were compared for HKTx vs recipients of a heart (n = 515) or kidney alone (n = 3,188) or both organs at separate time-points (n = 8). Patient and graft survival did not differ for HKTx vs any group. HKTx time to first rejection episode was significantly prolonged for both organs vs single-organ recipients. The incidence of CAV was significantly lower for HKTx. HKTx provides outcomes similar to those for solitary heart or kidney transplantation. There may be an immunologic advantage to receiving organs in a combined fashion. Such allocation of organs seems medically appropriate; however, more refined strategies are needed to identify optimal recipient populations.
