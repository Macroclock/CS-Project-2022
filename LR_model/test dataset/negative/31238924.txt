Case report: Anaerobiospirillum prosthetic joint infection in a heart transplant recipient. We report a case of prosthetic hip joint infection in a heart transplant recipient due to Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens, a genus of spiral-shaped curved anaerobic gram-negative rod which colonizes the gastrointestinal tract of cats and dogs. Invasive infections in humans are rare and typically occur in immunocompromised hosts. A 65-year-old male dog breeder with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, bilateral hip arthroplasties, and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with a heart transplant 10 years ago presented with a three month history of progressive left hip pain and frank purulence on hip aspiration. He underwent irrigation and debridement of the left hip and one-stage revision with hardware exchange. Although gram stain and culture from synovial fluid and intraoperative cultures were initially negative, anaerobic cultures from tissue specimens later grew a spiral-shaped gram-negative rod, identified as Anaerobiospirillum spp. by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The patient was treated with ceftriaxone 2 g daily for 6 weeks with a good response to treatment. A similar organism was unable to be isolated from culture of 2 of the patient's dogs, however, they were thought to be the most likely source of his infection. Anaerobiospirillum spp. should be considered in immunocompromised patients with exposure to dogs or cats who present with bacteremia, gastrointestinal infection, pyomyositis, or prosthetic joint infections, especially in cases of culture-negative or with anaerobic culture growth.
