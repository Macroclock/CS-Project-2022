Correlation of gene expression profiling score, cardiac hemodynamics and echocardiographic parameters in asymptomatic, rejection-free pediatric heart transplant recipients. To correlate gene expression profiling scores obtained by AlloMap Single-institution retrospective study of 210 AlloMap scores obtained concomitantly with cardiac catheterization and echocardiogram from 55 children during follow-up after cardiac transplantation. The median age at HT was 5.1 years (range, 0.9-14.1), with 29 males and 26 females. AlloMap scores were high in <2 years vs ≥2 years of age at the time of HT (P = .001), and trending higher with time after HT (R Our study provides preliminary data that the AlloMap score must be studied carefully before it can be used in children, particularly in those under 2 years of age. Monitoring of serial scores for each patient could potentially reflect changes in allograft performance that may determine indications for catheterization and biopsy which needs to be validated in future studies.
