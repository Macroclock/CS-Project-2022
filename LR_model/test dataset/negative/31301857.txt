Quality of Life Before and After Transplantation in Solid Organ Recipients Referred to the North Italy Transplant program (NITp): A Cross-sectional Study. The interest in health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) has increased in the past few years. The aim of this study was to evaluate the HR-QoL before and after transplantation in solid organ recipients referred to the North Italy Transplant program. This cross-sectional study was performed between 2010 and 2011. All consecutive recipients on the waiting list for liver, heart, or kidney transplantation were included and compared to all consecutive transplanted patients at 6 and 24 months of follow-up after transplantation. The HR-QoL was evaluated with the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Questionnaires were self-reported anonymously. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed. Four hundred eleven patients were interviewed: 146 patients (35.5%) were on the waiting list, 137 (33.3%) were transplanted 6 months before the interview, and 128 (31.1%) were transplanted 24 months before the interview. Patients on the waiting list had a lower SF-36 score for all items than did transplanted patients after both 6 and 24 months. According to POMS results, patients on the waiting list had a higher prevalence of depression, tension, anger, fatigue, and confusion than did transplanted patients. Patients on the waiting list showed a worse quality of life compared to patients after transplantation as demonstrated by SF-36 and POMS results. These findings should be confirmed in a cohort study.
