Increased long-term mortality in heart failure due to sleep apnoea is not yet proven. Previous small-scale studies of the effect of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) on prognosis in congestive heart failure (CHF) are either lacking or conflicting. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the presence and type of SDB on mortality in a patient group with severe CHF referred to a specialised heart failure centre. Out of 78 patients ((mean +/- SD) 53 +/- 9 yrs, left ventricular ejection fraction 19.9 +/- 7.2% and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 16.5 +/- 8.3 mmHg) followed-up over a median period of 52 months, 29% had no apnoea (CHF-N), 28% had obstructive sleep apnoea (CHF-OSA) and 42% had central sleep apnoea (CHF-CSA). At 52 months, their overall mortality was 40%, and combined mortality and transplantation was 72%. Mortality rates were similar between the three apnoea groups. Survivors had a similar prevalence of SDB (71%) as the nonsurvivors (70%). Although a significant increase in mortality was evident at 500 days in those patients with either CHF-SDB or CHF-CSA as compared with CHF-N, this was not significant at final follow-up (52 months) using Kaplan Meier analysis. Multivariate analysis identified transplantation but not SDB type or severity as a significant predictor of survival. In conclusion, sleep-disordered breathing impacts upon early (500 day), but not long-term (52 month), mortality in a specialised heart failure centre.
