Tacrolimus-induced polyneuropathy after heart transplantation. Tacrolimus has been often described to induce neuropathy in liver-, pancreas-, and renal-transplanted patients. Here, we report the first case of a 56-year-old woman who developed a progressive symmetric demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy in the distal muscles of the lower limbs after therapy with tacrolimus because of heart transplantation. This condition suddenly reverted after the tacrolimus was stopped.
