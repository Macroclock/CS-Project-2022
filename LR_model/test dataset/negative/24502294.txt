A novel approach inducing transplant tolerance by activated invariant natural killer T cells with costimulatory blockade. Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are one of the innate lymphocytes that regulate immunity, although it is still elusive how iNKT cells should be manipulated for transplant tolerance. Here, we describe the potential of a novel approach using a ligand for iNKT cells and suboptimal dosage of antibody for CD40-CD40 ligand (L) blockade as a powerful method for mixed chimerism establishment after allogenic bone marrow transplantation in sublethally irradiated fully allo recipients. Mixed-chimera mice accepted subsequent cardiac allografts in a donor-specific manner. High amounts of type 2 helper T cytokines were detected right after iNKT cell activation, while subsequent interferon-gamma production by NK cells was effectively inhibited by CD40/CD40L blockade. Tolerogenic components, such as CD11c(low) mPDCA1(+) plasmacytoid dendritic cells and activated regulatory T cells (Tregs) expressing CD103, KLRG-1 and PD-1, were subsequently augmented. Those activating Tregs seem to be required for the establishment of chimerism because depletion of the Tregs 1 day before allogenic cell transfer resulted in a chimerism brake. These results collectively suggest that our new protocol makes it possible to induce donor-specific tolerance by enhancement of the innate ability for immune tolerance in place of the conventional immunosuppression.
