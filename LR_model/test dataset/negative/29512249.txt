Low-dose valganciclovir prohylaxis is efficacious and safe in cytomegalovirus seropositive heart transplant recipients with anti-thymocyte globulin. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains an important pathogen in solid organ transplant patients. We executed a hybrid prophylactic and pre-emptive valganciclovir (VGCV) prophylaxis to prevent CMV infection in heart transplant patients with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) induction and retrospectively evaluated the efficacy and safety of this regimen. Hundred adult heart transplant patients between 2004 and 2010 were included. Recipients with CMV serostatus D+/R- received VGCV 900 mg OD for 6 months and 94.2% (81/86) of R+ recipients received a low-dose 450 mg OD for 3 months. Blood CMV was monitored until 3 months after cessation of the prophylaxis. All patients accomplished the prophylaxis. The overall incidence of CMV disease was 4% (4/100) and it was more frequent in D+/R- patients (P = .001). Three of eighty-six (3.5%) of R+ patients had CMV infection (one CMV disease) while on prophylaxis, 2/3 were still on the original significantly reduced renal dose though. There was one late CMV disease in both D+/R- and R+ groups. Ganciclovir/VGCV treatment was successful in all patients. The hybrid strategy with low-dose VGCV in R+ patients with ATG was efficient and safe. The good treatment results indicate that the regimen did not lead to a clinically relevant resistance. Optimal renal dosage is essential throughout prophylaxis. 'cytomegalovirus', 'heart transplant', 'prophylaxis', 'valganciclovir'
