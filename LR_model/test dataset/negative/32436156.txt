Long term CentriMag biventricular support using hybrid cannulation as a bridge to transplant in a pediatric patient. Paracorporeal continuous-flow ventricular assist devices designed for short-term support can also potentially provide long-term circulatory support as bridges to transplantation in children. We describe the long-term use of the CentriMag biventricular assist device with multiple pump changes in a 9-year-old boy with idiopathic-dilated cardiomyopathy. The initially implanted Berlin Heart EXCOR pumps were replaced by CentriMag due to thromboembolic complications. The CentriMag pumps were exchanged 15 times due to clot and fibrin formation or when the pumps reached their expiration dates. Connecting CentriMag to Berlin Heart EXCOR cannulae effectively served as an alternative long-term hybrid bridge to transplantation for 235 days. The patient successfully underwent a transplant after 284 days. Judicious pump monitoring and timely pump exchanges can potentially overcome device-related complications and extend the duration on support.
