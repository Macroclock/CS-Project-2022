The molecular diagnosis of rejection in liver transplant biopsies: First results of the INTERLIVER study. Molecular diagnosis of rejection is emerging in kidney, heart, and lung transplant biopsies and could offer insights for liver transplant biopsies. We measured gene expression by microarrays in 235 liver transplant biopsies from 10 centers. Unsupervised archetypal analysis based on expression of previously annotated rejection-related transcripts identified 4 groups: normal "R1 'basic (laboratory) research/science', 'biopsy', 'liver transplantation/hepatology', 'microarray/gene array', 'molecular biology: mRNA/mRNA expression', 'rejection'
