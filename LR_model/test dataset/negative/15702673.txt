Epicardial and microvascular graft vessel disease in children. Graft vessel disease (GVD) is one of the main limiting factors to long-term survival after adult heart transplantation (HTx). The incidence of epicardial and microvascular GVD in paediatric patients was studied. A total of 137 coronary angiographies from 130 paediatric HTx and heart and lung transplant (HLTx) patients (70 male, 60 female, aged 0-18 y) were evaluated according to the Stanford classification and its supplements (minor vessel alterations). In H&E stainings from right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies (EMB = 397), light microscopic diagnosis of acute cellular rejection (ISHLT classification) and vascular reaction (morphology of endothelial cells and vessel walls) was performed. Moderate rejection was present in 32.8% and severe rejection in 13.3% of EMB. Microvascular EC swelling was found in 33.5% and vessel wall thickening in 53.8% of EMB. The results of the coronary angiographic investigations were: Stanford lesions = 61.2%, peripheral obliterations = 52.5%, diameter fluctuations = 86.3%, pathologic tapering = 64.0%, calcifications = 10.8%. Long-term survivors (> or =5 y) showed macrovascular alterations in 78% of cases and microvascular alterations in 67% of cases. The development of micro- and macrovascular GVD is one of the predominant complications in long-term survivors after paediatric HTx and HLTx.
