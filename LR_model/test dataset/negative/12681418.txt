Selected patients listed for cardiac transplantation may benefit from defibrillator implantation regardless of an established indication. End-stage heart failure (HF) patients are at high risk of sudden cardiac death. This study evaluates the role of implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) in HF patients awaiting cardiac transplantation. We identified 194 consecutive patients (age 51 +/- 12 years) with New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4 HF (ejection fraction 22 +/- 9%) listed for cardiac transplantation, 35 of whom underwent ICD implantation. Of the implanted patients, 16 (Group A) had an established indication for ICD implantation (cardiac arrest, n = 10; sustained ventricular tachycardia [VT], n = 3; and positive electrophysiology study, n = 3). Nineteen patients (Group B) underwent ICD implantation for non-established indications (syncope with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, n = 4; non-sustained VT, n = 15). There were no procedural complications from ICD implantation. During follow-up of 9.2 +/- 10.1 months, there were 3 deaths in the ICD groups (A and B), and 40 in the control group (8.6% vs 25.2%, p = 0.032). Five patients in Group A and 6 in Group B (31%) received appropriate ICD therapy. The number of therapies per patient and the time to the first shock were similar between Groups A and B. Four of 6 Group B patients on outpatient inotropic therapy (67%) received appropriate ICD therapy. Selected end-stage heart failure patients awaiting heart transplantation, including those without established ICD indications, are at high risk for malignant arrhythmias and may benefit from ICD implantation. Patients with ICD seem to have improved survival compared to those without ICD. Randomized prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.
