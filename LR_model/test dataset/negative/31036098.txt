Unilateral interruption of pulmonary artery with pulmonary hypertension: a case for heart lung transplantation? Unilateral interruption of pulmonary artery is a rare congenital anomaly which is usually associated with other congenital heart disease. Even more rarely it may occur in isolation. Most of the cases are incidentally detected in adulthood. Some cases develop pulmonary hypertension for yet unknown reasons; such cases usually present in infancy with right heart failure. Surgical correction in such cases is associated with adverse outcomes. Heart lung transplantation should be considered in such patients. We report a 3-year-old boy with interruption of right pulmonary artery with severe pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure who was considered for heart lung transplantation.
