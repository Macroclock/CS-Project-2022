Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus endomyocardial abscesses in a heart transplant recipient. Infective endocarditis is more common in heart transplant recipients than in the general population. We report a case of endomyocardial abscesses and sepsis syndrome due to community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a heart transplant recipient with a negative transesophageal echocardiogram. The suspected portal of entry for this MRSA infection was through infected herpes zoster lesions. This case demonstrates the difficulty of diagnosing endomyocardial abscesses in heart transplant patients.
