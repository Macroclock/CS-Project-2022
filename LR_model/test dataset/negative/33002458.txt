Implications of obesity across the heart failure continuum. The obesity paradox, which suggests a survival advantage for the obese in heart failure (HF) has sparked debate in the medical community. Studies demonstrate a survival advantage in obese patients with HF, including those with advanced HF requiring continuous inotropic support for palliation or disease modifying therapy with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or heart transplantation (HT). Importantly, the obesity paradox is affected by the level of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). It is now recommended that HF patients with body mass index ≥35 kg/m 'Cardiorespiratory fitness', 'Cardiovascular disease', 'Heart failure', 'Heart transplant', 'Left ventricular assist device', 'Obesity'
