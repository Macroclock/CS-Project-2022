Thymoglobuline use in pediatric heart transplantation. The literature has few data regarding the use of polyclonal anti-thymocyte globulin in pediatric cardiac transplantation. We describe our single-center, retrospective study of the use of Thymoglobuline in a pediatric population. We included in the study 31 consecutive heart transplant recipients (mean age, 7.8 years; median age, 9 years; range, 4 months-17 years), who all survived surgery. To induce immunosuppression, all patients received Thymoglobuline therapy at age-dependent doses (1-1.5 mg/kg/day between 0 and 1 year; 1.5-2 mg/kg/day from 1 year to 8 years; and 2.5 mg/kg/day >8 years). Duration of treatment was 1 to 7 days. In patients <1 year, the total number of lymphocytes was maintained at >500/mm(3). Thirty of 31 patients are alive at the end of follow-up. During the first 3 months, 3 Grade 3A and 10 Grade 1A (Working Formulation grading system) rejection episodes occurred. All reversed after steroid treatment. Eleven viral infections, 2 bacterial infections, and 1 fungal infection occurred. Not all patients with infection were symptomatic but all responded successfully to treatment. One episode of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease regressed after decreasing immunosuppression therapy and after acyclovir therapy. At the end of follow-up, 19 patients are without steroids. Immunosuppression therapy with Thymoglobuline is safe in the pediatric age group if the number of lymphocytes is monitored strictly.
