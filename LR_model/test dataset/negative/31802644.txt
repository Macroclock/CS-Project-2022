The chameleon of cardiology: cardiac sarcoidosis before and after heart transplantation. Cardiac sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease with a large spectrum of symptoms that can mimic diseases such as dilated, hypertrophic, or arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies. It can be asymptomatic but can also present with ventricular arrhythmias, conduction disease, and heart failure (HF) or even sudden cardiac death (SCD). We present here the case of a patient transplanted due to end-stage arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), fulfilling the task force criteria. A few years after successful heart transplantation (HTX), the patient developed similar symptoms and morphofunctional changes of the heart, which led to critical re-evaluation of his primary diagnosis.
