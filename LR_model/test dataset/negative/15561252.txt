Heart transplantation using donors positive for hepatitis. From May 1994 to September 2003, 177 hearts were procured for heart transplantation (HTx) from donors ranging in age from 1 year 2 months to 66 years 5 months (mean = 30 years). All donors and recipients received serologic tests for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody (anti-HBs), and hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV). Thirty-two donors were HBsAg-positive and another four were anti-HCV-positive. Two HBsAg-positive donors were transplanted to patients with no previous evidence of hepatitis. After HTx, one received hepatitis B immunoglobulin prophylaxis and no hepatitis was noted during a 5 years follow-up. The other seroconverted at 4 months after HTx, requiring lamivudine treatment. Another four HBsAg-positive donors were transplanted to HBsAg-positive recipients. All four recipients had hepatitis flare-ups requiring lamivudine treatment. The other 26 HBsAg-positive donors were transplanted to anti-HBs-positive recipients. None suffered from hepatitis. Among the four patients receiving anti-HCV-positive hearts, seroconversion was noted in one recipient at 26 months. This patient never had clinical hepatitis before he died of allograft rejection at 3 years after HTx. The other three recipients remain anti-HCV negative during follow-up of 80, 50, and 46 months. It was concluded the hepatitis B- or C-positive donors could be used as heart donors for status 1 patients. Donors with positive HBsAg may be transplanted to anti-HBs-positive recipients with no HBV infection.
