Catheter-based edge-to-edge mitral valve repair for pulmonary pressure reduction and to postpone heart transplantation in a teenaged patient. We report a case of catheter-based edge-to-edge mitral valve repair in a teenage male patient with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy to improve pulmonary hypertension secondary to severe functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) to defer anticipated heart transplantation. A 19-year-old patient with previous history of fulminant myocarditis followed by markedly left ventricular dysfunction presented with severe mitral regurgitation 3Â years after initial recovery. Slightly over time, deterioration of FMR was associated with gradual increase in pulmonary artery pressures despite optimal medical therapy. MitraClip implantation in this young patient was successfully performed with sustainable improvement of pulmonary hypertension.
