Lower incidence of cytomegalovirus infection with everolimus versus mycophenolate mofetil in de novo cardiac transplant recipients: a randomized, multicenter study. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a major cause of infectious complications following cardiac transplantation, severely affecting short- and long-term outcomes. A 12-month, multicenter, randomized, open-label study in de novo cardiac transplant patients was undertaken to compare the efficacy, renal function, and safety of everolimus plus reduced cyclosporine versus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) plus standard cyclosporine (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00150046). CMV-specific data was prospectively collected on infections, laboratory evidence, CMV syndrome, and CMV disease. In total, 176 patients were randomized (everolimus 92; MMF 84). Use of CMV prophylaxis was similar between groups (everolimus 20.8%; MMF 24.0%). Patients in the everolimus arm had a significantly lower incidence of any CMV event (8.8% versus 32.5% with MMF, P<0.001), CMV infection as an adverse event (4.4% versus 16.9%, P=0.011), laboratory evidence of CMV (antigenemia 7.7% versus 27.7%, P<0.001; polymerase chain reaction assay 2.2% versus 12.0%, P=0.015), and CMV syndrome (1.1% versus 8.4%, P=0.028). In the donor (D)+/recipient (R)+and D-/R+ subgroups, even after adjusting for use of prophylaxis, the CMV event rate remained significantly lower with everolimus than with MMF (P=0.0015 and P=0.0381, respectively). In conclusion, de novo cardiac transplant recipients experienced lower rates of CMV infection, CMV syndrome, or organ involvement on an everolimus-based immunosuppressant regimen compared with MMF.
