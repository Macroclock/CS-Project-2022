Anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody inhibits heart transplant rejection mediated by alloantigen-primed CD4(+) memory T cells in nude mice. Donor-reactive CD4(+)memory T cells threaten the survival of transplanted organs. In this study, we used anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody (mAb) to inhibit adoptively transferred B6-reactive CD4(+)memory T cells (BALB/c origin) and to induce tolerance of B6 hearts in nude mice. The median survival time (MST) of the grafts was 6 days in the isotype group, and more than 100 days in the group treated with 8 doses of anti-CD44 at four-day intervals. Histological analysis revealed that the mean rejection level was Grade 3 in the isotype group, and Grade 0 or 1 in the multi-dose anti-CD44 treatment group. Compared with the isotype group, the multiply treated anti-CD44 group had significantly decreased IL-2 and IFN-γ expressions, while IL-10 and TGF-β were increased in the serum and the graft. Foxp3 in the graft was also increased. These data demonstrate that alloreactive CD4(+) memory T cells mediate the destruction of allografts, and the adhesion molecule CD44 plays an important role in this course. Anti-CD44 mAb may promote the reduction of CD4(+)memory T cells and the production of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Furthermore, Tregs are maintained at a certain level while suppressing cellular immunity and inducing the grafts long-term survival in transplant recipients.
