Right ventricular hemodynamics and performance in relation to perfusion during first year after heart transplantation. We aim to evaluate changes in invasive haemodynamics, right ventricular (RV) function, and perfusion during the first year after heart transplantation (HTx) and to determine the relation between RV function and myocardial perfusion. Thirty patients were prospectively enrolled at the time of HTx. Right heart catheterization (RHC), comprehensive 2D and 3D echocardiography and cardiac biomarkers were performed at baseline (≤2 weeks after HTx) and at follow-up 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after HTx. At 12 months, HTx patients were subjected to an exercise stress test with assessment of maximal oxygen consumption (VO Normalization of left and right atrial filling pressures is demonstrated within the first 3 to 6 months after HTx. RV function and RV perfusion reserve correlated and gradually improved during the first year after HTx but RV function remained reduced in HTx patients compared with healthy controls.
