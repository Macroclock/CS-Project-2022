Bosentan improved persistent pulmonary hypertension in a case after implantation of a left ventricular assist device. No medical treatment has been established to ameliorate pulmonary hypertension (PH) due to left heart disease. Heart transplantation (HTx) is thus far the definitive therapy for stage D heart failure, but concomitant PH is one of the major risk factors for death after HTx. Recently, implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has been reported to improve PH and has become a major bridge tool for HTx. We experienced a rare case with persistent PH even after the implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD. The administration of an endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan, significantly decreased pulmonary vascular resistance. Combination therapy with LVAD implantation and anti-PH medication may be useful for patients with stage D heart failure complicated with severe PH.
