Provision of anaesthesia for porcine cardiac transplantation at the veterinary school in Trinidad and Tobago. A successful heterotopic cardiac transplantation was performed between sibling female Yorkshire Juvenile swine. Adequate pre-medication with azaperone and a smooth induction were ensured for both pigs, which were anaesthetized simultaneously with sodium thiopentone followed by endotracheal intubation and intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Inhalation anaesthetic agents were used for maintenance, neuromuscular blockade was achieved with cisatracurium and both fentanyl and tramadol were used to provide analgesia. Invasive monitoring was used in both the donor and recipient. Central venous pressure (CVP) was maintained at > 10 cm H2O and mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 mmHg. Heparin was injected during the surgical dissection of the heart in the donor to prevent coronary thrombosis and prior to aortic side clamping for end-to-side anastomosis of the donor heart in the recipient abdomen. After transplantation, the cardiovascular parameters of the recipient showed a MAP of 85-105 mmHg and a CVP of 8-10 cm H2O while echocardiography of the transplanted heart confirmed an ejection fraction (EF) of 80%. A functional anaesthetic team was assembled and trained to provide anaesthesia for porcine cardiac transplantation. The transplanted heart suffered pump failure after 69 days and was excised for performance of tissue analysis.
