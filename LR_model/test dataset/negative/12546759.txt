Squamous cell carcinoma in solid-organ transplantation. Multiple advances in the field of transplantation over the last several decades have resulted in a significant increase in the number of surgeries performed and in years of life extended. However, with the success of transplant comes the dilemma of potential complications of lifelong immunosuppressive therapy. An enormous increase in skin cancer, especially highly-aggressive squamous cell carcinoma, may affect this special population of patients. This review article discusses the main etiologic theories of squamous cell carcinoma, characteristics of skin cancer in the immunosuppressed patient, differences in skin cancer amongst three types of solid-organ transplantation (kidney, heart, and liver), and established and new treatments.
