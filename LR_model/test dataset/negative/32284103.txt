Pulmonary Hypertension and Right Ventricular Failure: Lung Transplant Versus Heart-Lung Transplant. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a highly morbid disease with limited treatment options that improve survival and currently the only curative treatment is transplantation. There is a small body of literature comparing the efficacy of lung and heart-lung transplantation in this population. The bulk of evidence suggests that most patients with severe right ventricular failure undergoing transplant will have recovery of right ventricular function after lung transplantation. Existing data suggest that, in the absence of complex congenital heart disease or significant left ventricular dysfunction, double-lung transplant is the surgical procedure of choice.
