HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device Implantation for Pediatric Heart Failure-A Single Center Approach. While pediatric HeartWare HVAD application has increased, determining candidacy and timing for initiation of pediatric VAD support has remained a challenge. We present our experience with a systematic approach to HVAD implantation as a bridge to pediatric heart transplantation. We performed a retrospective, single center review of pediatric patients (n = 11) who underwent HVAD implantation between September 2014 and January 2018. Primary endpoints evaluated were survival to heart transplantation, need for right ventricular assist device (RVAD) at any point, ongoing HVAD support, or death. Median patient age was 11 years (range: 3-16). Median BSA was 1.25 m 'Heart failure', 'Mechanical circulatory support', 'Outcomes', 'Pediatric', 'Pulmonary hypertension', 'Ventricular assist device'
