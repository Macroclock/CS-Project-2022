Improvement in chronic renal failure after mycophenolate mofetil introduction and cyclosporine dose reduction: four-year results from a cohort of heart transplant recipients. Chronic renal failure (CRF) due to calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) nephrotoxicity is a frequent complication among heart transplant (HT) recipients. Small studies have suggested that the introduction of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can help to reduce CNI doses thereby to maintaining or improving renal function. We conducted a 4-year, prospective, multicenter study in 89 maintenance HT recipients at 5.6 ± 2.7 years postgrafting who displayed CRF (serum creatinine > 1.4 mg/dL) and were undergoing treatment with cyclosporine and prednisone ± azathioprine. We introduced MMF and reduced cyclosporine to level below 100 ng/mL. Creatinine clearance (CrCl), acute rejection episodes, and survival were through retrospectively compared with a contemporary cohort of HT recipients who were not treated with MMF (control group; n = 38). After conversion to MMF, a rapid increase was observed in the CrCl, which was maintained over the follow-up: namely, CrCl at month 6 and at 4 years were 51.0 ± 15.6 and 54.1 ± 15.6 mL/min versus 41.9 ± 11.1 mL/min at baseline (P < .0001). No renal function changes were observed among the control group. Acute rejection rates were 5.6% and 2.6% in the MMF versus control groups (P = NS) with 4-year survivals >85%. In conclusion, the introduction of MMF allowed a safe reduction of cyclosporine and significantly improved renal function after 4 years.
