The occurence of mood and anxiety disorders in heart transplant recipients. Fortynine heart transplant recipients were evaluated during the first weeks after orthotopic heart transplantation. Using the ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases-10th revision) criteria, we studied the incidence of anxiety disorders as well as 17 demographic and medical factors potentially influencing the probability of their occurrence. A smaller 36-person group was evaluated using standard psychopathologic scales for anxiety and mood disorders. Cox regression analysis was used to specify which of 11 demographic and medical factors influenced the time to occurrence of the first episode of a mental disorder. Anxiety episodes occurred in 25 patients, depressive episodes in 27, (hypo)manic in 3, and 12 manifested a slightly elevated mood. The risk of occurrence of anxiety and mood disorders was highest during the first 3 weeks after OHT. "False alarms," namely, calls to the clinic not ending up in transplantation, and coexisting illnesses were related to higher incidences and earlier appearance of anxiety and mood disorders. The risk of occurrence of an anxiety syndrome was greater among older patients. Anxiety syndromes were manifested earlier in patients who underwent transplantation due to ischemic cardiomyopathy than in patients with heart failure caused by other factors. A greater number of false alarms, of long-lasting hospitalizations, and of low mean cyclosporine levels were risk factors for depressive episodes.
