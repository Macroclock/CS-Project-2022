Impact of fixed pulmonary hypertension on post-heart transplant outcomes in bridge-to-transplant patients. Fixed pulmonary hypertension (FPH) is considered a contraindication to cardiac transplantation. Ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy through prolonged left ventricular unloading may reverse FPH. Our aim was to assess post-transplant outcomes and survival in patients with and without FPH undergoing VAD implantation as bridge to transplant. Fifty-four patients received an intracorporeal left VAD (LVAD) as a bridge to transplant from 2000 to 2008 at two institutions (Rigshospitalet, Denmark, and the Toronto General Hospital, Canada). Twenty-two (41%) patients had fixed FPH (defined as pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR] >3 Wood units and resistant to pulmonary vasodilators) prior to VAD implant (FPH group) and were compared with 32 patients without FPH (NoFPH group). Baseline characteristics, pre- and post-transplant pulmonary pressures, incidence of complications and post-transplant survival were analyzed. Baseline characteristics were similar except that patients in the FPH group were older (46 ± 11 years vs 39 ± 13 years in the NoFPH group, p < 0.05). The mean pre-VAD PVR was 4.3 ± 1.7 Wood units in the FPH group and 1.7 ± 0.5 Wood units in the NoFPH group (p < 0.001). Pulmonary pressures were higher in the FPH group immediately prior to VAD implant, but they were comparable immediately pre-transplant and during the first year post-transplant. The incidence of post-transplant RV failure was not significantly different between groups. Post-transplant survival was similar between groups. VAD therapy successfully decreases pulmonary hypertension, even in patients with "fixed" FPH, allowing candidacy for heart transplantation. Among bridge-to-transplant candidates, the presence of FPH does not reduce post-transplant survival.
