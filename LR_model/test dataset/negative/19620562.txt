Cyclosporine-induced infantile nodulocystic acne. In adult organ transplant recipients, nodulocystic acne induced by the use of cyclosporine can be treated successfully with isotretinoin. Cyclosporine's acnegenic effects in children and the pediatric response to treatment are less clear. A 9-month-old boy presented with cysts and nodules on his face after he began cyclosporine therapy after a heart transplantation. We describe successful treatment with cessation of cyclosporine therapy and administration of isotretinoin. Nodulocystic acne may be induced by the use of cyclosporine in children as well as adults. When it occurs, it can be managed with cessation of cyclosporine therapy and treatment with isotretinoin. Because this management approach may influence other outcomes in children with transplants, it is best to treat these patients using a multidisciplinary approach.
