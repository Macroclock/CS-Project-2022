Performing a myocardial biopsy in a cardiac transplant patient with a persistent left superior vena cava. The life expectancy of patients with congenital heart disease is increasing. Thus, as the prevalence of adults with congenital heart disease increases, invasive cardiologists will have more exposure to these patients and will benefit from expertise in the anatomy of congenital heart defects. We present a case of performing right heart catheterization and myocardial biopsy in a cardiac transplant patient with a history of multiple congenital defects including a persistent left superior vena cava.
