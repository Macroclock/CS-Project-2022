Cardiac Transplantation and Consecutive Minimally Invasive Pectus Excavatum Repair. Pectus excavatum is a common chest wall deformity with inward deviation of sternum and accompanying ribs. The depression can cause symptomatic cardiac compression, although the cardiopulmonary impact remains controversial. We present 2 cases of cardiac transplantation followed by modified minimally invasive pectus excavatum repair due to the hemodynamic consequences of the pectus deformity.
