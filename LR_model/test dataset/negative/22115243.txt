Transcatheter repair of combined ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm and aortic arch aneurysm through a cardiac transapical approach. We describe a new surgical technique performed in a heart-transplanted patient who underwent transcatheter repair of combined ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm and aortic arch aneurysm. The endografts were deployed through a left ventricular transapical approach by using a left mini-thoracotomy after previous debranching of the brachiocephalic vessels.
