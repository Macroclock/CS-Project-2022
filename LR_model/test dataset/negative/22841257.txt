Valvular procedures during ventricular assist device implantation. Increased experience and success with ventricular assist devices (VAD) has permitted more aggressive use in patients formerly believed to be inappropriate for mechanical circulatory support (MCS). There is no clearly proven policy to manage end-stage heart failure patients with valvular pathologies. The aim of this report was to analysis our experience with combined approach of VAD implantation and valvular procedures among patients with valvular heart disease and end-stage heart failure. We evaluated the clinical records of 67 patients who underwent MCS from April 2007 to September 2011. We identified 12 patients (17.9%) who received concomitant valvular procedures, four of whom had significant aortic insufficiency and received a simple coaptation stitch at the center to approximate the fibrous nodules of Arantius. The mechanical aortic valve was replaced with a stentless bioprosthesis in three patients. Mitral valve commissurotomy was performed in one patient with mitral stenosis and seven patients underwent tricuspit valve repair using an annuloplasty ring. All 12 patients were males, of mean age 50.3 Â± 11.5 years (range = 25-66). Eleven of them (91.6%) survived the early and late postoperative periods. Ten subjects (83.3%) continue to be supported with VAD; 1 (8.3%) was successfully bridged to transplantation. Each study participant regression of the valvular pathologies by early echocardiography demonstrated. Concomitant valve surgery during VAD implantation appeared to be a reasonable option in end-stage heart failure patients with valvular heart disease.
