Low-Dose Donor Dopamine Is Associated With a Decreased Risk of Right Heart Failure in Pediatric Heart Transplant Recipients. Previous studies in adults have suggested that donor dopamine treatment may improve recipient outcomes in organ transplantation; in this analysis, we aimed to determine if donor dopamine reduces the incidence of postoperative right heart failure (RHF) in pediatric heart transplant recipients. Data for recipients aged 18 years or younger transplanted at our institution between January 1, 2000, and June 15, 2011, and their respective donors were obtained. The presence of postoperative RHF was assessed for in all subjects. Donor dopamine dose was stratified into 3 groups: none, low-dose (≤5 μg/kg per minute), and high-dose (>5 μg/kg per minute). Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between donor dopamine dose and recipient RHF. Of 192 recipients, 34 (18%) experienced postoperative RHF. There was no difference in baseline demographics between recipients with and without RHF. When controlling for pulmonary vascular resistance index, graft ischemic time, and cardiopulmonary bypass time, donor low-dose dopamine was independently associated with a decreased risk of RHF (odds ratio, 0.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.70; P = 0.02); however high-dose dopamine was neither associated with, nor protective of, RHF (odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.06-1.6; P = 0.16). Despite advances in perioperative care of the recipient, RHF persists as a complication of pediatric heart transplantation. In this study, donor pretreatment with low-dose dopamine is associated with a decreased risk of postoperative RHF in pediatric heart recipients. Further studies into this association may be useful in determining the utility of empiric donor pretreatment with low-dose dopamine.
