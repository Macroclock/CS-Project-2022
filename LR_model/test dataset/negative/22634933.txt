Total hip arthroplasty in avascular necrosis of the femoral head in a patient with transplanted heart. With the improvement of transplantation techniques and immunosupresive treatment of transplanted patients, the number of heart transplantations increases worldwide including Croatia. The survival of such patients is significantly increased. Therefore, the prevalence of known complications is high, one of which is avascular necrosis of the femoral head. This paper presents a case of the first patient in Croatia who underwent bilateral hip arthroplasty due to bilateral avascular necrosis of the femoral head as a side effect of corticosteroid therapy after heart transplantation.
