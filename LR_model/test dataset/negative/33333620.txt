Percutaneous endovascular management of ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm after heart transplantation in a pediatric patient. Ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm is a rare complication after HT. Surgery is the most conventional management, but in some patients, it is risky. We report the case of a ten-year-old child who underwent HT and developed an ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm in the aortic anastomosis. He was successfully treated with two covered stents through endovascular management. Endovascular therapy is an alternative management in high-risk patients. To our knowledge, this is the first report about endovascular therapy of an AAP after HT in a pediatric patient. 'aneurysm', 'aorta', 'heart transplantation', 'pediatrics', 'stents'
