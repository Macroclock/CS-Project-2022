A hemodynamic profile for consciousness during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. We report the quantification of a hemodynamic profile sufficient to support consciousness during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A 62-yr-old man experienced cardiac arrest while being evaluated for heart failure after heart transplantation. During the emergency, hemodynamic data were obtained from bedside monitors and reviewed at regular intervals. His mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were correlated with consciousness during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A mean arterial blood pressure of 50 mm Hg with a heart rate of 100 bpm supported consciousness during cardiac arrest. This case helps to validate the recent emphasis on hard, fast, basic life support.
