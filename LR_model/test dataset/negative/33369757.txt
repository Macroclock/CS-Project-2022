Fatigue after heart transplantation - a possible barrier to self-efficacy. Recovery after heart transplantation is challenging and many heart recipients struggle with various transplant-related symptoms, side-effects of immunosuppressive medications and mental challenges. Fatigue has been reported to be one of the most common and distressing symptoms after heart transplantation and might therefore constitute a barrier to self-efficacy, which acts as a moderator of self-management. To explore the prevalence of fatigue and its relationship to self-efficacy among heart recipients 1-5 years after transplantation. An explorative cross-sectional design, including 79 heart recipients due for follow-up 1-5 years after transplantation. Three different self-assessment instruments were employed; The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-19, Self-efficacy for managing chronic disease 6-Item Scale and The Postoperative Recovery Profile. The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Board of Lund (Dnr. 2014/670-14/10) with supplementary approval from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Dnr. 2019-02769). The reported levels of fatigue for the whole group were moderate in all dimensions of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-19, with highest ratings in the General Fatigue sub-scale. Those most fatigued were the groups younger than 50 years; pretransplant treatment with Mechanical Circulatory Support; not recovered or had not returned to work. Self-efficacy was associated with the sub-dimensions Mental Fatigue (ρ = -0·.649) and Reduced Motivation (ρ = -0·617), which explained 40·1% of the variance when controlled for age and gender. The small sample size constitutes a limitation. The moderate levels of fatigue reported indicate that it is not a widespread problem. However, for those suffering from severe fatigue it is a troublesome symptom that affects the recovery process and their ability to return to work. Efforts should be made to identify those troubled by fatigue to enable sufficient self-management support. 'fatigue', 'heart transplantation', 'self-efficacy', 'self-management', 'symptom'
