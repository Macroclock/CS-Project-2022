The comparison of mitogen-activated protein kinases that become activated within the left ventricular and right atrial tissues following heart transplantation in canine model. The activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) plays an important role in ischemia/reperfusion injury. Some reports have documented MAPKs activation of the myocardium in human models, using right atrial (RA) tissue for samples. This study compared the activation of MAPKs in left ventricle (LV) and RA tissues in canine heart transplantation. Four dogs were used as baseline data at two points, before and 20 min after warm ischemia (baseline model), and eight dogs (four pairs of donor and recipient) were used at other points: 4 h after cold ischemia, and at 10, 60, and 180 min after reperfusion (transplantation model). In the transplantation model, donor hearts were left in situ for 20 min after cardiac arrest, and were immersed in Celsior solution for 4 h after coronary flushing. Orthotopic heart transplantation was then performed. Two groups were created: the LV and RA groups (n = 4 in each group). Heart tissue was harvested from the left ventricular wall in the LV group and from the right atrial appendage in the RA group. The activation of MAPKs, including p38 MAPK, c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), was evaluated at each point. The activation patterns of p38 MAPK and ERK were similar in the RA and LV groups, but JNK activation was different in the two groups, after ischemia and reperfusion. Thus, RA tissue may be deliberately used as a substitute for LV tissue when investigating the activation of MAPKs in a human model.
