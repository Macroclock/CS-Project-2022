Initial report of bridge to recovery in a patient with DuraHeart LVAD. Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) provide acceptable clinical results, but the long waiting period for heart transplantation leads to diverse complications. LVAD support can cause reverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling that results in the improvement of LV function and allows LVAD removal. We present a case of successful removal of a DuraHeart LVAD because of sufficient recovery of LV function. Before LVAD removal, we conducted an "LVAD weaning test" by decreasing pump speed and performing an additional normal saline infusion test. We consider that the LVAD weaning test can be used in place of the "pulsatile LVAD off test."
