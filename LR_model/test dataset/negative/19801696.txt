Isolated left ventricular non-compaction: an unusual indication for heart transplantation. We report a patient with isolated left ventricular non-compaction diagnosed by echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. She developed refractory congestive heart failure and subsequently underwent successful heart transplantation. This type of cardiomyopathy is thought to be caused by the arrest of normal embryogenesis of the endocardium and myocardium. The spectrum of clinical, radiological, and pathological abnormalities is discussed.
