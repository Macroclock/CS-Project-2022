Prevalence of chronic kidney disease in orthotopic heart transplant recipients and kidney allograft recipients using the new Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important long-term complication of all forms of nonrenal organ transplantation. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of kidney dysfunction among heart (n = 163) and kidney allograft recipients (n = 169) using the new Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula, which includes age, gender, and comorbidities. The mean serum creatinine values in these populations were 1.58 ± 0.75 mg/dL and 1.36 ± 0.56 mg/dL, respectively. In heart allograft recipients mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by (MDRD) was 57.14 ± 26.17 mL/min, and by CKD-EPI formula was 57.44 ± 26.76 mL/min whereas in kidney allograft recipients it was 63.91 ± 25.43 mL/min and 65.20 ± 25.60 mL/min, respectively. According to the MDRD formula, stage 2 CKD was noted in 35 patients; stage 3 CKD in 79 patients, and stage 4 in 23 patients. According to the CKD-EPI formula stage 2 CKD was displayed by 35 patients; stage 3 CKD in 78 patients, and stage 4 in 23 patients. Clinically significant CKD (GFR < 60 mL/min) was observed in 62% of patients. According to the MDRD normal kidney function was present in 22 and according to the CKD-EPI formula in 27 patients. According to the MDRD formula stage 2 CKD was found in 59 kidney allograft recipients; stage 3 in 58 patients; and stage 4 in 16 patients. According to the CKD-EPI formula, stage 2 CKD was noted in 63 patients; stage 3 in 58 patients; and stage 4 in 15 patients. Clinically significant CKD was observed in 44% of patients. Using MDRD or CKD-EPI normal kidney function was found in 36 and 33 patient, respectively. CKD prevalence is extremely high among heart and kidney transplant recipients. Evaluation of renal function is important to select the appropriate strategy to reduce the cardiovascular risk.
