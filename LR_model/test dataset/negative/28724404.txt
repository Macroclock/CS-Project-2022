Temporal trends of dialysis requiring acute kidney injury after orthotopic cardiac and liver transplant hospitalizations. The epidemiology and outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in prevalent non-renal solid organ transplant recipients is unknown. We assessed the epidemiology of trends in acute kidney injury (AKI) in orthotopic cardiac and liver transplant recipients in the United States. We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to evaluate the yearly incidence trends (2002 to 2013) of the primary outcome, defined as AKI requiring dialysis (AKI-D) in hospitalizations after cardiac and liver transplantation. We also evaluated the trend and impact of AKI-D on hospital mortality and adverse discharge using adjusted odds ratios (aOR). The proportion of hospitalizations with AKI (9.7 to 32.7% in cardiac and 8.5 to 28.1% in liver transplant hospitalizations; p This study highlights the growing burden of AKI-D in non-renal solid organ transplant recipients and its devastating impact, and emphasizes the need to develop strategies to reduce the risk of AKI to improve health outcomes.
