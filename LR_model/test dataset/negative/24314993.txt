Severe heart failure due to noncompaction cardiomyopathy: a case report. Noncompaction cardiomyopathy involves an infrequent pathology whose diagnosis has been rising in recent years owing to a better understanding of the disease and, therefore, better diagnosis. Today, there are no well established protocols for its treatment. For this reason, it is necessary to adapt the therapy of choice to each patient. We report the case of a 35-year-old man with no past medical history of interest who was admitted due to acute pulmonary edema. Diagnostic tests revealed noncompaction cardiomyopathy with biventricular severe systolic dysfunction. In this situation, heart transplantation was considered to be the best therapeutic option, which was carried out with an uneventful postoperative course. This is one of the few cases reported in the literature for this issue.
