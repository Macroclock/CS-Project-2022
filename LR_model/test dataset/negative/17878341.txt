Inhibition of terminal complement components in presensitized transplant recipients prevents antibody-mediated rejection leading to long-term graft survival and accommodation. Ab-mediated rejection (AMR) remains the primary obstacle in presensitized patients following organ transplantation, as it is refractory to anti-T cell therapy and can lead to early graft loss. Complement plays an important role in the process of AMR. In the present study, a murine model was designed to mimic AMR in presensitized patients. This model was used to evaluate the effect of blocking the fifth complement component (C5) with an anti-C5 mAb on prevention of graft rejection. BALB/c recipients were presensitized with C3H donor skin grafts 7 days before heart transplantation from the same donor strain. Heart grafts, transplanted when circulating anti-donor IgG Abs were at peak levels, were rejected in 3 days. Graft rejection was characterized by microvascular thrombosis and extensive deposition of Ab and complement in the grafts, consistent with AMR. Anti-C5 administration completely blocked terminal complement activity and local C5 deposition, and in combination with cyclosporine and short-term cyclophosphamide treatment, it effectively prevented heart graft rejection. These recipients achieved permanent graft survival for >100 days with normal histology despite the presence of systemic and intragraft anti-donor Abs and complement, suggesting ongoing accommodation. Furthermore, double-transplant experiments demonstrated that immunological alterations in both the graft and the recipient were required for successful graft accommodation to occur. These data suggest that terminal complement blockade with a functionally blocking Ab represents a promising therapeutic approach to prevent AMR in presensitized recipients.
