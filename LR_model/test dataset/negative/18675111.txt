Outcome of patients listed for heart transplantation after a failed surgical ventricular restoration procedure. Patients with end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy (IHD) and left ventricular (LV) dilatation are increasingly treated by means of surgical ventricular restoration (SVR). In some patients, SVR can delay heart transplantation (HTX). We retrospectively analyzed our experience, trying to ascertain whether HTX after a failed SVR (fSVR) carried a greater mortality risk. Since 1985, we performed 742 HTX. Since June 1999, 133 IHD patients were listed for HTX. We assigned them to 3 groups: (A) not a redo (n=54); (B) redo after coronary artery bypass grafting (n=54); and (C) redo after fSVR (n=25). Respectively, 37, 33, and 12 patients underwent HTX with in-hospital mortality after HTX of 4/37 (10.8%), 12/33 (36.4%), and 2/12 (16.7%). Mortality on the list was 9/54 (16.7%), 11/54 (20.4%), and 7/25 (28.0%) respectively. Removal from the list occurred in 4, 5, and 2 patients, and 4, 5, and 4 patients are still awaiting HTX, respectively. In group C, the mean time from SVR to HTX list was 45.6+/-43.3 months, and list mortality occurred after 5.83+/-5.81 months. In-hospital mortality in both patients of group C was due to the occurrence of multisystem organ failure; 10/12 were extubated after 19.3+/-9.6 hours and discharged from the intensive care unit after 3.9+/-1.6 days. The recorded complications were: 3 acute renal failure, 1 pericardial effusion, and 2 episodes of acute rejection. Since only 5/25 patients with fSVR had undergone SVR at our institution, we cannot establish which patients were really eligible for HTX at the time of SVR. Our experience showed that patients listed for HTX displayed a high list mortality, but that HTX after a failed SVR did not seem to have a poorer outcome than HTX after previous conventional CABG.
