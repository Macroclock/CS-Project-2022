Low incidence of neurologic events during long-term support with the HeartMate XVE left ventricular assist device. Neurologic events during left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support are associated with significant morbidity and death. To evaluate this problem, we analyzed neurocognitive function and the frequency and incidence of neurologic events in 21 consecutive patients who were undergoing long-term support with the HeartMate XVE LVAD (Thoratec Corporation; Pleasanton, Calif). The mean duration of LVAD support was 531 days (range, 55-1, 309 d); the cumulative support time was 11,188 days (30.7 yr). No patients received anticoagulant therapy, and most received aspirin. None experienced strokes or transient ischemic attacks. Twenty patients were discharged from the hospital; 2 were later readmitted because of transient changes in neurologic status (metabolic encephalopathy) that ultimately resolved. Neurologic function, as measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the Modified Rankin Score (MRS), was abnormal before LVAD implantation but normal 6 and 12 months after (mean NIHSS, 23.6 before vs 0 after; mean MRS, 0.68 before vs 0.18 after). Neurocognitive function, as evaluated by the Boston Naming Test, Trail Making Test part B, and Block Design Test, also improved during LVAD support. Together, these findings indicate that few neurologic events occur during long-term HeartMate XVE LVAD support in the absence of anticoagulation therapy. They also suggest that modifications made to the HeartMate LVAD since the REMATCH trial have resulted in fewer complications, and that better patient selection and supportive care have improved outcomes.
