Transcatheter closure of a patent foramen ovale in an adult with hypoxemia after cardiac transplantation. We describe a case of refractory hypoxemia secondary to a patent foramen ovale immediately after orthotopic heart transplantation in a 60-year-old woman. The patent foramen ovale was successfully closed with a septal occlusion device, with resolution of the hypoxemia. To our knowledge, transcatheter closure of a patent foramen ovale in an adult patient with refractory hypoxemia during the immediate post-transplant period has not previously been reported.
