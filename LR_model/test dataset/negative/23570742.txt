Time course of acquired von Willebrand disease associated with two types of continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices: HeartMate II and CircuLite Synergy Pocket Micro-pump. Bleeding complications are frequent adverse events in patients supported with axial continuous-flow pumps. Previous retrospective studies demonstrated that bleeding events in patients with the HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA) were attributed to acquired von Willebrand syndrome. We sought to analyze the von Willebrand factor (VWF) profile in patients receiving a HeartMate II or a CircuLite (Saddle Brook, NJ,) device (Synergy Pocket Micro-pump) prospectively. Prospectively analyzed were 34 patients supported with left ventricular assist device (LVAD; 26 with HeartMate II and 8 with CircuLite). The control group comprised 20 patients who underwent heart transplantation (HTx). Blood samples were taken pre-operatively and at 14 days and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-operatively. Patients with LVADs had a high incidence of bleeding complications. From the immediate post-operative phase throughout the entire observation, the VWF ristocetin cofactor activity (Rco)/antigen (Ag) ratio of patients with HeartMate II and CircuLite devices was consistently lower compared with HTx patients. No correlation was found between the individual VWF:Rco/Ag ratio and bleeding events or transfusion requirements. The VWF:Rco/Ag ratio normalized immediately in patients who received HTx. Acquired von Willebrand syndrome was confirmed to occur immediately after the implantation of both types of LVAD and persisted up to 12 months. A lower VWF:Rco/Ag ratio was associated with larger transfusion requirements. Acquired von Willebrand syndrome resolves after LVAD explantation.
