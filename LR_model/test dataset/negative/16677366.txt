Development of multiple food allergies in children taking tacrolimus after heart and liver transplantation. Angioedema and chronic diarrhea in patients taking immunosuppressants are not always because of side effects and could be a new onset of food allergy. Our aim is to discuss the pathogenesis and treatment of the post-transplant development of food allergies. The first patient was receiving tacrolimus subsequent to heart transplantation and developed angioedema after consumption of dairy products at 12 months after transplantation. He was found to be allergic to multiple foods by both RAST and ImmunoCAP tests. The second patient with argininosuccinic aciduria, post-liver transplant, also received tacrolimus and developed chronic non-mucoid/bloody diarrhea at seven months following transplantation. ImmunoCAP test was positive only for egg white and peanuts. Biopsy showed eosinophilic infiltration of the mucosa from the stomach to the rectum. Elimination diets in both patients resolved the symptoms. These cases suggest a direct relationship between tacrolimus and development of food allergy.
