The costs of change: direct medical costs of solid organ transplantation in British Columbia, Canada, 1995-2003. Solid organ transplantations are among the most expensive treatments yet relatively few investigators have reported well-characterized and reliable information on costs. The objective here was to compare the direct medical costs of kidney, liver, heart, and lung transplantations in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Using data from a province-wide population-based registry, resource utilization data were collated for 1333 patients who underwent solid organ transplantation between 1995 and 2003. Resource categories included hospital stays, physician fees, laboratory and diagnostic testing, and immunosuppressants. Mean costs (2003 $CDN) were derived for the index hospitalization and each of the 2 years after hospital discharge. To enable valid comparisons, the same costing methodology was applied to all four programs. The mean costs of transplantation varied from $27,695 for kidney recipients to $89,942 for lung recipients, with inpatient hospital stays comprising the largest component. Mean costs for the first and second follow-up years ranged from $27,592 and $11,424 for lung recipients to $21,144 and $8086 for liver recipients. Immunosuppressants accounted for between two-thirds and three-fourths of costs by the second year. Within each program, variations in costs could not be accounted for by demographic factors. We observed in BC a threefold variation in mean costs of organ transplantation procedures, with the variations between programs diminishing during follow-up. Policymakers and decision-makers seeking to better understand the deployment of resources for transplantation may focus on clinical factors at the time of hospitalization and factors that influence use and costs of immunosuppressants during the induction and maintenance phases.
