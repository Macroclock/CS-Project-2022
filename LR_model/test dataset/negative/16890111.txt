Coronary vasomotor response to phenylephrine in heart transplant patients. Coronary vasomotor responses to sympathetic stimulation vary with endothelial-layer integrity or presence of atherosclerosis. Our study objective was to assess the effects of phenylephrine-induced alpha-adrenergic stimulation on coronary vasomotion in heart transplant recipients with and without graft atherosclerosis. Intracoronary phenylephrine (alpha(1)-selective agonist) was injected in 6 control subjects, 9 recipients with angiographically normal coronary arteries and 8 recipients with mild or moderate atherosclerosis. Coronary flow velocity was measured using a Doppler guide-wire. The diameters of 3 epicardial segments of the left coronary artery and coronary blood flow and resistance were assessed at baseline, after infusion of increasing acetylcholine doses (10(-7) and 10(-6) mol/liter) and after phenylephrine (150- to 200-microg bolus). Systemic and coronary hemodynamic parameters were measured immediately after acetylcholine and 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 15 minutes after phenylephrine. Phenylephrine induced similar significant increases in rate pressure product in the 3 groups. Acetylcholine induced epicardial vasodilation in controls and vasoconstriction in transplant recipients. Phenylephrine induced epicardial vasodilation in controls and in angiographically normal recipients; subsequent vasoconstriction occurred in this last group. In the recipients with angiographic abnormalities, sustained vasoconstriction occurred. At peak phenylephrine effect, coronary blood flow (CBF) increased significantly (p < 0.001 vs baseline) in all 3 groups. Coronary resistance decreased in the 3 groups but the decrease was smaller in the recipients with angiographic abnormalities (p < 0.05 vs controls). In heart transplant patients, graft atherosclerosis unmasks the direct coronary vasoconstricting effects of pharmacologic alpha-adrenergic stimulation.
