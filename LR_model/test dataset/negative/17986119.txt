Prevalence of pleural effusions post orthotopic heart transplantation. The prevalence and natural history of pleural effusions occurring after orthotopic heart transplantations (OHT) are essentially unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence, laterality, size and prognosis of pleural effusions occurring after OHT. Eighty-three patients who underwent OHT between August 1997 and January 2003 were screened retrospectively. CXR and chest CT scans of all patients were reviewed. Chart review was performed for patients with large effusions (occupying 25% or more of a hemithorax) with specific attention to thoracentesis results. Seventy-two patients were included in the study. Sixty-one (85%) developed an effusion at some time during the first 365 postoperative days. The majority of post-OHT effusions were bilateral and small, occupying less than 25% of the hemithorax. Pleural effusions occupying 25% or more of a hemithorax occurred in 17% (12/72) of the patients within 12 months of OHT. Overall, the majority of effusions resolved within the first year after transplantation. The prevalence of pleural effusions within 12 months following OHT is high (85%). Most effusions are small, bilateral and resolve within 1 year.
