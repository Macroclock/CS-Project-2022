Tacrolimus-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome in a pediatric heart transplant recipient. HUS is a well-known entity primarily associated with bacterial infection and is characterized by a classic triad of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and kidney injury. Its atypical form has been associated with calcineurin inhibitors and has been extensively discussed in renal transplantation. We present a case of tacrolimus-associated HUS in a pediatric heart transplant recipient, which we believe to be previously unreported in the literature.
