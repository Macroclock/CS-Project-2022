BVS5000 support after cardiac transplantation. This study examines short-term mechanical assist device support for cardiac transplant patients and compares their outcomes with nontransplant patients requiring similar support. Of 350 cardiac transplant patients at our institution, 7 patients required mechanical ventricular assistance with the Abiomed BVS5000 assist device (Abiomed, Inc, Danvers, Mass) after transplant secondary to severe acute rejection with cardiogenic shock (n = 4) or primary graft failure (n = 3). Recovery of ventricular function, survival to discharge, and complications were determined for the transplant group and compared with a second group comprising all other patients supported with the BVS5000 at our institution (n = 15). Additionally, the results of prior series reporting mechanical ventricular support of the failing transplant heart are reviewed. Demographics and duration of support were similar between the groups. The transplant group had a higher wean rate from device relative to the nontransplant group (100% versus 13%; P < 0.01). Five of 7 in the transplant group achieved survival to discharge (71%), relative to 5 of 15 in the nontransplant group (33%). Complications between the two groups were similar, although the transplant group experienced a higher rate of renal insufficiency (57% versus 13%, P = 0.05). Severe acute rejection with cardiogenic shock and primary graft failure are two conditions that may warrant mechanical ventricular support in the cardiac transplant patient. Transplant patients with these conditions have a high rate of ventricular functional recovery, greater than nontransplant patients supported with the same device and for a similar period of time. Although the incidence of renal insufficiency was higher, the majority of transplant patients who were supported with the BVS5000 achieved survival to discharge.
