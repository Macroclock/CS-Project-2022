Experimental heart transplantation: effect of cyclosporine on expression and activity of metzincins. Metzincins, such as matrix metalloproteases (MMP), and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins are differentially regulated in inflammation. We hypothesised that metzincins are also dysregulated in experimental acute cardiac allograft rejection. We investigated the Dark Agouti-to-Lewis (DA-to-Lew) rat model of acute cardiac allograft rejection. Cyclosporine (CsA) (7.5 mg/kg/d) was given from transplantation to sacrifice (day +5). At that time, mRNA levels were analysed by Affymetrix genechip and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR). MMP protein and activities were analysed by immunohistology, fluorometry, zymography and Western blots. In untreated rejected DA allografts, mRNA levels of MMP-2/-7/-9/-/12-/14, a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM)-17, tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease (TIMP)-1/-3 were increased, whereas MMP-11/-16/-24 and TIMP-2/-4 were lowered compared to native DA hearts. With respect to these untreated allografts, CsA lowered mRNA levels of MMP-7, TIMP-1/-3 (TIMP-2/-4 remained relatively low) and ADAM17, but augmented mRNA levels of MMP-11/-16/-23 and of many ECM genes. Immunohistology showed increased staining of MMP-2 in acute rejection (AR). Overall MMP activity was augmented in both transplanted groups, but CsA reduced MMP-9 activity and MMP-14 production. Taken together, MMP and TIMP were upregulated during acute AR. CsA ameliorated histology of rejection but showed potential pro-fibrotic effects. Thus, MMP and TIMP may play a role in acute cardiac allograft rejection, and beneficial modification of the MMP-ECM balance requires interventions beyond CsA.
