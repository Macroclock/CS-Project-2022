Cardiac transplantation in a patient with emotionally triggered implantable cardioverter defibrillator storms. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) may be responsible for psychological disorders especially among patients experiencing multiple shocks. An associated hyperadrenergic state (e.g., anger, anxiety) may trigger malignant ventricular arrhythmias repeatedly treated by ICD shocks, entertaining a "vicious circle" often difficult to interrupt. Despite aggressive cardiac and psychological therapeutic efforts, this condition may be refractory, finally leading to heart transplantation, as described in this case report.
