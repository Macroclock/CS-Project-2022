Acitretin for prophylaxis of cutaneous malignancies after cardiac transplantation. Heart transplant recipients have an increased risk of developing actinic keratoses and non-melanotic skin cancers when compared with the general population. Systemic retinoids have been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of such lesions in recipients of other organs, but as of yet the heart transplant model has rarely been studied. In this investigation we describe our experience with the use of acitretin in a group of heart transplant patients. Five heart transplant recipients with multiple new skin cancer presentations were treated with acitretin at doses of either 10 or 25 mg/day. Inclusion criteria were based on progressive actinic keratoses, recurrent skin malignancies or continuous lesions despite treatment with appropriate topical therapies. Patients were excluded if they were women of child-bearing age, had severe hepatic or renal impairment or were taking contraindicated medications. Over the treatment period all patients showed a reduction in the number of new non-melanotic skin cancers excised and histologically confirmed. Three patients had a very large reduction and 2 patients had a more moderate reduction in the number of new presentations. All patients had an objective decrease in the number of actinic keratoses. All patients tolerated the drug well with only 1 patient transiently discontinuing the Acitretin due to side effects. No significant alterations in the biochemical tests or serum lipids were reported. Over the treatment period, low-dose acitretin proved a valuable addition in the long-term strategy of reduction and treatment of non-melanotic skin cancers in heart transplant recipients with multiple skin cancers and actinic keratoses.
