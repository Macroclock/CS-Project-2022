Surgical and interventional therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Surgical and interventional therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in appropriately selected patients have the potential to dramatically improve or, in some cases, cure PAH. These include atrial septostomy, a palliative procedure or bridge to transplantation in patients with refractory right heart failure, pulmonary thromboendarterectomy for pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic thromboembolic disease, and closure of congenital systemic-pulmonary shunts in patients with PAH but without significant pulmonary vascular disease. Lung transplantation should be considered for patients with all forms of PAH who demonstrate advanced or progressive disease.
