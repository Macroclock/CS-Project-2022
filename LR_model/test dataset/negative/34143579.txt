Utilization of Paragonix SherpaPak for human donor heart preservation. A heart transplant is the gold standard treatment for end stage heart failure. Preservation of the donor heart during its transfer from the hospital of the donor to that of the recipient has a significant impact on the outcome of the transplant procedure. Icebox storage is a conventional method utilized for this purpose that may not provide uniform cooling of the donor heart and does not allow monitoring of the temperature of the donor heart during preservation. The Paragonix SherpaPak Cardiac Transport System offers uniform cooling by suspending the donor heart in a preservation solution and provides continuous temperature monitoring.
