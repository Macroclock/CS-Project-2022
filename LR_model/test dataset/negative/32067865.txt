Platelet aggregation and response to aspirin therapy in cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Long-term survival after heart transplantation (HTx) is compromised by cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) characterized by coronary macro- and microvascular disease. The pathogenesis of CAV is unclear and may involve coronary thrombosis. We investigated whether HTx patients with CAV had higher platelet aggregation and turnover than HTx patients without CAV and healthy controls. Furthermore, we investigated the anti-platelet effect of low-dose aspirin in HTx patients. We included 57 patients who had undergone HTx (median 8.3 years from HTx) and 57 healthy controls. Platelet aggregation was measured on-aspirin and off-aspirin using impedance aggregometry with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and arachidonic acid (AA). We evaluated platelet turnover by flow cytometry, CAV burden by coronary angiography and echocardiography, and microvascular function by echocardiographic coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR). Off-aspirin, HTx patients with CAV (n = 21) had higher ADP-induced platelet aggregation than healthy controls (p < 0.01) and HTx patients without CAV (n = 36) (p < 0.05). Aspirin treatment reduced AA-induced platelet aggregation in both HTx groups, but HTx patients with CAV had higher platelet aggregation on-aspirin than HTx patients without CAV (p < 0.05). Platelet turnover did not differ between HTx patients with CAV and HTx patients without CAV (p > 0.34). HTx patients with lower CFVR values had higher platelet aggregation than HTx patients with higher CFVR values (p < 0.05). Off-aspirin, platelet aggregation was higher in HTx patients with CAV than in HTx patients without CAV and healthy controls. On-aspirin, platelet aggregation was higher in HTx patients with CAV than in HTx patients without CAV. Aspirin monotherapy may not provide sufficient platelet inhibition in HTx patients with CAV.
