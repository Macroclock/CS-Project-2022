Beyond rose colored glasses: the adaptive role of depressive and anxious symptoms among individuals with heart failure who were evaluated for transplantation. The prospect of and the evaluative period for transplantation can be stressful for individuals with heart failure (HF). Little is known about the impact of psychosocial factors on service utilization and health outcomes. The current study examined the impact of depression, dysthymia, and anxiety on two-yr hospitalization and mortality among 96 individuals with HF who were evaluated for transplantation. Results revealed that only a small percentage of individuals endorsed sufficient symptomatology to meet criteria for a psychiatric, Axis I disorder (3.1% = anxiety; 2.1% = depression; 1.0% = dysthymia) although a significant proportion of the sample was prescribed an antidepressant or an anxiolytic (37%). Multivariable regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between significant independent demographic, medical, and psychiatric predictors and total duration of hospitalizations; logistic regression analysis was used to examine the relation between predictors and mortality. An increase in anxious symptoms was associated with a decrease in total number of days hospitalized during the two-yr period following the initial evaluation. Similarly, as depressive symptoms increased, risk of two-yr mortality decreased. Future research should assess communication between the patient and providers to further elucidate the potential relationship between psychiatric symptoms, service utilization/hospitalization, and mortality in this patient population.
