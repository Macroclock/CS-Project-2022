Cyclosporine in transplantation - a history of converging timelines. Discovery and pharmacological development of cyclosporine was conducted by Jean Borel and colleagues in the 1970s. Cyclosporine is the first compound to inhibit the lymphocytes specifically and reversibly, and represents the prototype of a new generation of immunosuppressive drugs: the calcineurine inhibitors. Historical chronology of successes in clinical application of cyclosporine and development of solid-organ transplantation are retraced here, underscoring the converging timelines of this drug and these interventions. In 1978-79 the first successful results of the use of cyclosporine in kidney were reported. Cyclosporine was the first single drug able to control rejection. In 1982-83 first trials demonstrated the benefit from treatment with cyclosporine in kidney recipients compared to azathioprine and steroids. In the 1980s solid-organ transplantation entered the cyclosporine era with unhoped-for results in heart transplantation. The present review focuses also on cyclosporine-based regimen of immunosuppression, adverse side effects and safety in pregnancy in subjects under treatment with cyclosporine.
