Quilty effect has the features of lymphoid neogenesis and shares CXCL13-CXCR5 pathway with recurrent acute cardiac rejections. Quilty effect (QE) is a frequent, yet enigmatic feature of cardiac allograft, since it is apparently devoid of clinical significance, though its association with acute (A) rejection (R) is strongly suspected. It was observed in 126/379 biopsies from 22 patients during the first posttransplant year. Most grade (G)2R biopsies displayed a concomitant QE. The following features typical of QE were identified: (a) focal angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis associated with bFGF, VEGF-C and VEGF-A expression, (b) marked infiltrate of CD4(+)T and CD20(+)B followed by CD8(+)T lymphocytes arranged around PNAd(+)HEV-like vessels. Most QE appear as distinct B-T-cell-specific areas with lymphoid follicles sometimes endowed with germinal center-like structures containing VCAM-1(+)CD21(+)FDC and CD68(+)macrophages, which frequently expressed CXCL13. These cells were also found in mantle-like zones, where small lymphocytes expressed CXCR5, otherwise in the whole area of not clustered lymphoid aggregates. CXCL13 was also expressed, in association with CD20(+)B lymphocyte recruitment, in G2R biopsies obtained from patients with recurrent AR. QE has features of a tertiary lymphoid tissue suggesting an attempt, by the heart allograft, to mount a local response to a persistent alloantigen stimulation resulting in aberrant CXCL13 production, as also occurs in recurrent AR. CXCL13-CXCR5 emerge as a common molecular pathway for QE and recurrent episodes of AR.
