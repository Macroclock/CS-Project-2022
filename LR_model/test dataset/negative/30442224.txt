Acute Coronary Syndromes in Heart Transplant Recipients (from a National Database Analysis). With an expanding and aging heart transplant population, the incidence of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is expected to increase. Our study aims to report current trends in in-hospital management and outcomes in heart transplant recipients presenting with ACS. We conducted an analysis of the National Inpatient Sample (2007 to 2014) to study the trends in hospitalization, in-hospital management, and outcomes in heart transplant recipients with a primary diagnosis of ACS. We included patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI (NSTEMI) and those with unstable angina pectoris (UAP). A total of 1,621 ACS (NSTEMI/UAP-76% vs STEMI-24%) hospitalizations were identified. Despite 1,327 (81%) of patients who underwent left heart catheterization, coronary revascularization was performed in only 576 patients (36%). Mortality was significantly higher in patients presenting with STEMI versus NSTEMI/UAP (28% vs 11%, respectively; p <0.05) and those who did not undergo revascularization (19% vs 7%; p <0.05). Cardiogenic shock (CS) was diagnosed in 14.5% patients. Mechanical circulatory support utilization was higher in CS group compared with non-CS group (69% vs 2.8%; p <0.05), as was in-hospital mortality (39% vs 10%; p <0.05). Repeat transplantation during the index hospitalization was done in 4.5% of ACS patients. In conclusion, in heart transplant recipients, ACS is associated with a high incidence of CS and in-hospital mortality. Aggressive treatment strategy that includes revascularization, mechanical circulatory support use (in those developing CS), and urgent retransplantation in suitable candidates seems to lead to better results than a more conservative strategy.
