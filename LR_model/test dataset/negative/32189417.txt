Permanent pacemaker implantation in pediatric heart transplant recipients: A systematic review and evidence quality assessment. Bradyarrhythmias are a common complication following pediatric OHT and may require permanent pacemaker implantation (PPM). The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence, predictors, and outcomes of children undergoing PPM implantation following OHT. A PRISMA-compliant systematic literature review was performed using the PubMed database and the Cochrane Library (end-of-search date: January 27, 2019). The Newcastle-Ottawa scale and the Joanna Briggs Institute tool were used to assess the quality of cohort studies and case reports, respectively. We analyzed data from a total of 11 studies recruiting 7198 pediatric patients who underwent heart transplant. PPM implantation was performed in 1.9% (n = 137/7,198; 95% CI: 1.6-2.2) of the patients. Most patients underwent dual-chamber pacing (46%, 95% CI: 32.6-59.7). Male-to-female ratio was 1.3:1. Mean patient age at the time of OHT was 10.1 ± 6.3. Overall, biatrial anastomosis was used in 62.2% (95% CI: 52.8-70.6) of the patients. The bicaval technique was performed in the remaining 37.8% (95% CI: 29.4-47.1). Sinus node dysfunction was the most frequent indication for PPM implantation (54.4%; 95% CI: 42.6-65.7) followed by AV block (45.6%; 95% CI: 34.3-57.3). The median time interval between OHT and PPM implantation ranged from 17 days to 12.5 years. All-cause mortality was 27.9% (95% CI: 18.6-39.6) during a median follow-up of 5 years. PPM implantation is rarely required after pediatric OHT. The most common indication for pacing is sinus node dysfunction, and patients undergoing biatrial anastomosis may be more likely to require PPM.
