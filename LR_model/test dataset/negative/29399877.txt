Acute humoral rejection in an infant without risk factors after heart transplantation. Graft rejection is the most common factor that limits graft survival after transplantation. During infancy, the humoral immune system is partially suppressed and humoral rejection of a cardiac allograft has not been reported in the absence of risk factors such as prior transplantation, blood transfusions, ventricular assist devices, and elevation of panel reactive antibodies. We present a case of an infant with dilated cardiomyopathy who developed multiple episodes of acute humoral rejection after heart transplantation in the absence of risk factors.
