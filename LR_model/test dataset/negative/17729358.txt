T2-weighted cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Technical advances in T2-weighted cardiovascular MR (CMR) imaging allow for accurate identification and quantification of tissue injuries that alter myocardial T2 relaxation. Of these, myocardial edema is of special relevance. Increased myocardial water content is an important feature of ischemic as well as nonischemic cardiomyopathies, which are often associated with acute myocardial inflammation. In this article, we review technical considerations and discuss clinical indications of myocardial T2-weighted imaging.
