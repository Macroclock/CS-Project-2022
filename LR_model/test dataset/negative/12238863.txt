Left ventricular assist device for right side assistance in patients with transposition. Right (systemic) ventricular dysfunction is well described after Senning operations for transposition of the great arteries, and patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries. Transplantation remains the only definitive therapy for refractory heart failure, however patients may deteriorate clinically prior to the availability of a donor heart. This report details the implantation of a TCI Heartmate (Thoratec Corp., Pleaston, CA) as a morphologic right ventricular assist device to bridge these patients to transplantation.
