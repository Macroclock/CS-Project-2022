The impact of severe acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy on survival and renal function of heart transplant recipients - a UK cohort study. Severe acute kidney injury (AKI), defined as requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), is associated with higher mortality postheart transplantation, but its long-term renal consequences are not known. Anonymized data of 3365 patients, who underwent heart transplantation between 1995 and 2017, were retrieved from the UK Transplant Registry. Multivariable binary logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors for severe AKI requiring RRT, Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare survival and renal function deterioration of the RRT and non-RRT groups, and multivariable Cox regression model to identify predicting factors of mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 26.0% of heart recipients received RRT post-transplant. The RRT group has lower survival rates at all time points, especially in the immediate post-transplant period. However, conditional on 3 months survival, older age, diabetes and coronary heart disease, but not post-transplant RRT, were the risk factors for long-term survival. The predicting factors for ESRD were insulin-dependent diabetes, renal function at transplantation, eGFR decline in the first 3 months post-transplant, post-transplant severe AKI and transplantation era. Severe AKI requiring RRT post-transplant is associated with worse short-term survival, but has no impact on long-term mortality. It also accelerates recipients' renal function deterioration in the long term.
