Successful long-term bridge to transplant in a 5-year-old boy with the EXCOR left ventricular assist device. We report on a 5-year-old boy who presented with postcardiotomy failure after aortic valve replacement and had to undergo implantation of a Berlin Heart-Excor system since treatment with ECMO did not improve myocardial pump function. After a stormy postoperative course with delayed sternal closure after 9 days, the young boy finally recovered and could be fully mobilized. Until successful heart transplantation after a support interval of 77 days, he experienced no device-related infectious or thromboembolic complications.
