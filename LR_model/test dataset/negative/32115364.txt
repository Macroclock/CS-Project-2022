Precise treatment of acute antibody-mediated cardiac allograft rejection in rats using C4d-targeted microbubbles loaded with nitric oxide. Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) constitutes an important cause of cardiac allograft loss; however, all current therapeutic strategies represent systemic applications with unsatisfactory efficacy. Previously, we successfully non-invasively detected C4d, a specific marker for AMR diagnosis, in allografts using C4d-targeted microbubbles (MB We designed novel MB We successfully obtained CEUS images following NO-MB This study presented a novel tool to provide simultaneous non-invasive diagnosis and precise treatment of AMR using NO-MB 'C4d', 'antibody-mediated rejection', 'contrast-enhanced ultrasound', 'non-invasive diagnosis', 'precise treatment'
