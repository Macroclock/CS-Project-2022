Clinical spectrum of atypical fibroxanthoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma in solid organ transplant recipients: a collective experience. Atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX) and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) are uncommon, spindle cell cutaneous malignancies. Solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) are immunosuppressed and therefore have a higher incidence of cutaneous malignancies. We describe the clinical spectrum of AFX and a more-aggressive, deeper variant, UPS, in SOTRs. A retrospective chart review of AFX and UPS in SOTRs was implemented. Cases from Vanderbilt University, Emory University, Mayo Clinic-Jacksonville, and University of Rochester were included. A literature search included previously published cases. The average age of SOTRs at time of tumor presentation was younger than typically seen in immunocompetent patients for AFX. Rates of local recurrences and metastases were higher in the SOTRs than is noted in the immunocompetent literature. Rates of recurrence were higher in those treated with excision than in those treated with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). AFX and UPS may have a greater risk for recurrence, metastases, and mortality in SOTRs, in whom early treatment with MMS may demonstrate certain advantages in terms of minimizing risk of recurrence and metastasis. UPS and recurrent tumors should be staged appropriately and may respond to adjuvant radiation therapy and reduction of immunosuppression. Immunohistochemical evaluation is recommended to exclude other spindle cell tumors.
