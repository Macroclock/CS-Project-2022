Prevalence of Pathogenic Gene Mutations and Prognosis Do Not Differ in Isolated Left Ventricular Dysfunction Compared With Dilated Cardiomyopathy. Genetic evaluation is recommended in patients with unexplained dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), but its diagnostic yield and prognostic relevance in unexplained isolated left ventricular dysfunction (LVdys) is unknown. A total of 127 LVdys and 262 DCM patients underwent genetic screening. Long-term outcome consisted of a combined end point of life-threatening arrhythmia, heart transplantation, and death. At baseline, LVdys patients were younger and had less frequently New York Heart Association class ≥3 when compared with DCM (55±13 versus 58±12;  Genetic evaluation is advised in LVdys patients and should not merely be restricted to DCM.
