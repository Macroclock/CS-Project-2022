Vitamin E action on oxidative state, endothelial function and morphology in long-term myocardial preservation. This study assesses the effects of a vitamin E analogue, Trolox, on the oxidative state, endothelial function and morphology in experimental heart transplantation. Heterotopic heart transplantation was carried out in pigs: untreated after 2 and 24 hours of ischemia and treated with Trolox after 24 hours of ischemia. Prolonged preservation of donor hearts was achieved with continuous perfusion and University of Wisconsin solution, in which acid-base balance and enzymes were determined during the procedure. In recipients, hemodynamic and biochemical parameters were determined at baseline and during reperfusion. Trolox diminished the pH of the preservation solution (p<0.01), the left ventricle of the transplanted heart recovered a systolic pressure equaling that of the 2h group and higher than that of the untreated 24h group (p<0.01), the antioxidant levels were not decreased and the glutathione reductase level was maintained throughout the first part of reperfusion. In this group also there was a direct correlation between the concentration of this enzyme and the antioxidant levels (p<0.001). Although the endothelin concentrations increased, the change was less marked in the Trolox group than in the untreated 24h group (p<0.01). Morphologically, mitochondria and myocardial vessels presented a normal structure in the Trolox group, and interstitial edema, inflammatory infiltrate and contraction bands were less prominent than in the untreated group. All these effects indicate that Trolox protected the transplanted heart, at least partially, against ischemia-reperfusion injury.
