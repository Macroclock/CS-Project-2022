Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Heart transplantation remains the most durable treatment for end-stage heart disease that is not amenable to coronary revascularization or anti-arrhythmic therapies. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) remains one of the main contributors to morbidity and mortality post heart transplant. Nonimmune and immune factors that influence CAV can be modified after a heart transplant. Given the potential silent nature of CAV in the denervated heart, early diagnosis of CAV is critical. Diagnosis and treatment of CAV remain key areas of investigation to improve patient care and quality of life post heart transplant. While repeat heart transplantation is an option in the treatment of significant CAV, outcomes following retransplantation are inferior to outcomes following first heart transplant. Repeat heart transplantation is limited to a select group of patients after index heart transplant.
