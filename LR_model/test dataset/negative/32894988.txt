Transition of a Large Tertiary Heart Failure Program in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Changes That Will Endure. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic imposed severe restrictions on traditional methods of patient care. During the pandemic, the heart failure program at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York, NY rapidly and comprehensively transitioned its care delivery model and administrative organization to conform to a new healthcare environment while still providing high-quality care to a large cohort of patients with heart failure, heart transplantation, and left ventricular assist device. In addition to the widespread adoption of telehealth, our program restructured outpatient care, initiating a shared clinic model and introducing a comprehensive remote monitoring program to manage patients with heart failure and heart transplant. All conferences, including administrative meetings, support groups, and educational seminars were converted to teleconferencing platforms.
