Comparison of cardiac and peripheral arterial stiffening and ventriculovascular uncoupling in patients with uncomplicated hypertension versus patients with hypertension after heart transplantation. Despite normal ejection fractions, patients who undergo heart transplantation (HT) have low peak aerobic capacity and reduced arterial compliance, suggesting "ventriculovascular uncoupling." To what extent this is related to post-transplantation hypertension versus the unique characteristics of the donor-recipient relation remains poorly understood. Echocardiograms were retrospectively reviewed from 126 normal subjects, 309 patients with uncomplicated hypertension (UH), and 58 consecutive patients with HT >1 year after the procedure who were stable without evidence of rejection. Left ventricular (LV) end-systolic elastance (Ees), a measure of LV systolic performance; effective arterial elastance (Ea), a measure of vascular stiffness; and Ea/Ees, a parameter describing ventriculovascular coupling, were obtained. Compared with normal subjects, tandem increases in Ea (+24% and +85%, all p values <0.0001) and Ees (+23% and +33%, all p values <0.0001) were observed in patients with UH and HT, respectively, with patients with HT having significantly higher values than those with UH (both p values <0.05). Although the Ea/Ees ratio remained similar between normal subjects and patients with UH, patients with HT exhibited increases in the Ea/Ees ratio (all p values <0.01) and reduced stroke volume indexes (-20% and -22%, respectively, all p values <0.05). These changes were associated with a doubling of LV concentric remodeling in patients with HT compared with those with UH (67% vs 34%, p <0.0001). In conclusion, HT is associated with increases in Ees, Ea, and the Ea/Ees ratio, suggesting ventriculovascular uncoupling and maximal LV stroke work. These aberrations, which determine cardiovascular performance in the setting of HT, are not simply explained by vascular age or post-transplantation hypertension but may adversely affect functional capacity.
