Transplantation for pulmonary arterial hypertension with congenital heart disease: Impact on outcomes of the current therapeutic approach including a high-priority allocation program. Patients with end-stage pulmonary arterial hypertension due to congenital heart disease have limited access to heart-lung transplantation or double-lung transplantation. We aimed to assess the effects of a high-priority allocation program established in France in 2007. We conducted a retrospective study to compare waitlist and posttransplantation outcomes before versus after implementation of the high-priority allocation program. We included 67 consecutive patients (mean age at listing, 33.2 ± 10.5 years) with pulmonary arterial hypertension due to congenital heart disease listed for heart-lung transplantation or double-lung transplantation from 1997 to 2016. At one month, the incidences of transplantation and death before transplantation were 3.5% and 24.6% in 1997-2006, 4.8% and 4.9% for patients on the regular list in 2007-2016, and 41.2% and 7.4% for patients listed under the high-priority allocation program (p < .001 and p = .0001, respectively). Overall survival was higher in patients listed in 2007-2016 (84.2% and 61.2% at 1 and 10 years vs. 36.8% and 22.1%, p = .0001). Increased incidence of transplantation, decreased waiting list mortality, and improved early and long-term outcomes were observed in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension due to congenital heart disease listed for transplantation in the recent era, characterized by implementation of a high-priority allocation program.
