Biomarkers and Donor Selection in Heart Transplantation. Previously, we showed that B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) measured in the donor was related to cardiac performance after cardiac transplantation. The present study assesses the value of 3 biomarkers in the selection of donor hearts in a larger cohort. Blood samples were prospectively obtained in 105 brain-dead patients scheduled for heart donation. BNP, soluble suppressor of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2), and troponin of heart donors were correlated with hemodynamic parameters early after transplantation as well as with the mortality of the recipients. A significant inverse relationship was found between donor BNP measured at the time of donation and recipient cardiac index and cardiac output at day 13 post-transplantation (r = -0.31, P = .005, and r = -0.34, P = .0016, respectively). Logistic regression analysis-including BNP, ST2, and troponin-showed that donor BNP was a predictor of a poor cardiac index (< 2.2 L/min/m Donor BNP, but not donor ST2 or high-sensitivity troponin, provides information on the donor heart and early post-transplant performance, including 1-month mortality.
