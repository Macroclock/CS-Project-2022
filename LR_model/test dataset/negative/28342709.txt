Transitioning from pediatric to adult care after thoracic transplantation. With improving outcomes after thoracic transplantation, more children are surviving to adulthood and requiring specialized adult care. A systematic and effective program is essential to transition these patients from a pediatric to adult health care setting. In this review, we discuss the concept of transition and the factors leading to an effective transfer to an adult care provider, including administrative support, patient/provider preparation, and the navigation of potential barriers. Notably, there is a paucity of data for many details of transition, making this a significant opportunity for future research.
