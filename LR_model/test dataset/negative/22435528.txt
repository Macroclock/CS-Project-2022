Serum markers of apoptosis in the early period of heart transplantation. To assess the relationship between levels of serum markers of apoptosis and rejection grades in heart transplant (HTx). A prospective study was conducted in 91 HTx. We correlated apoptosis markers and biopsy samples. The apoptosis markers were: TRAIL, TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, TRAIL-R3, TRAIL-R4, sFas, sTNF-R1 and sTNF-R2. The only significant correlation with rejection grade was sFas (r=0.329; p=0.005). Cyclosporine showed a proapoptotic effect (sTNF-R1 0.02 and sTNF-R2 0.02) and everolimus an antiapoptotic effect (sTNF-R1 r= -0.523; p=0.0001 and sTNF-R2 r= -0.405; p=0.0001). The utility of specific apoptosis markers in peripheral blood for diagnosis of acute cellular rejection is low. Everolimus may have an anti-apoptotic effect.
