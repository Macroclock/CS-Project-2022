Family functioning in the families of paediatric heart transplant recipients prior to outpatient visits and procedures. In a cross-sectional study, we assessed family functioning prior to outpatient visits and routine heart catheterisations in the families of paediatric heart transplant recipients. Caregivers rated higher short-term family functioning prior to outpatient visits, but not prior to catheterisations. This finding may indicate that family functioning benefits from the support provided during outpatient visits.
