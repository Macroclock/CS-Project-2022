[In vivo detection of integration of grafted cells after myocardial transplantation]. Myocardial transplantation of myocytes and bone marrow derived cells is currently under clinical evaluation as an alternative therapy of heart failure. One of the main problems of all clinical studies performed so far is the inability to track the fate of the transplanted cells. The aim of our study was the development of a potentially clinically applicable approach, which allows for detection of the transplanted cells without need for collection of tissue samples. Fetal canine cardiomyocytes were labelled with the non-toxic fluorescent membrane dye Vybrant CM-DiI and delivered into the free wall of the left ventricle of adult mongrel dogs. For subsequent tracking of the cellular graft, the dogs underwent a second operation in which an intra-vital microscope was mounted above the exposed heart within the thorax. A special computer software eliminated artefacts caused by myocardial contraction. Two months after transplantation, the fluorescent graft was macroscopically visible by intra-vital microscopy using a 10x magnification. Histological studies served as microscopic control and confirmed the existence of DiI-labelled cells at the site of injection. Connexin 43 immunoreactivity was visible at junctional complexes between donor and recipient cells, suggesting morphologic and functional coupling as a result of gap junction formation. Our results demonstrate that in vivo detection of transplanted cells in the heart is feasible. Further technical adjustments should allow for thoracoscopic/endoscopic application of this method, making it appropriate for use in other organs and in clinical studies.
