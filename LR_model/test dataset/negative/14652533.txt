Dynamic cardiomyoplasty as a biomechanic bridge to heart transplantation. We report a heart transplantation that was done 4 years after a dynamic cardiomyoplasty operation. The patient was a 42-year-old man. Radionucleide ventriculography with technetium 99 m revealed an ejection fraction of 18%. In July 1997 he had undergone a dynamic cardiomyoplasty operation. At the first postoperative month the left ventricular ejection fraction was 35%. In September 2000 he presented with heart failure symptoms. In May 2001 he had undergone heart transplantation. Postoperative course was uneventful. The failure of cardiomyoplasty was probably caused by degeneration of the latissimus dorsi muscle. In this case we have learned that muscle viability is lost within 4 years after dynamic cardiomyoplasty and heart transplantation is still an option for those patients.
