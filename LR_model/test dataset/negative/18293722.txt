Surgery for acute heart failure syndromes. This article describes the role of surgery in the management of acute presentations of heart failure. Intervention is set in the context of medical management. If the cause of the failure is not apparent this help is limited to mechanical support as intra-aortic balloon pumping, heart assistance or replacement. The most dependable management for refractory, severe heart failure remains heart transplantation but is dependent upon donor organ availability.
