Now how do we get them home? Outpatient care of pediatric patients on mechanical circulatory support. The last five yr have been monumental for the pediatric heart failure community. In the US, the most notable has been the FDA approval of the first pediatric specific device (Berlin Heart EXCOR(®) ; Berlin Heart, Inc., Berlin, Germany). Subsequently, the field of heart failure has gained a great deal of knowledge regarding the nuances of MCS in children.
