Disseminated Acanthamoeba infection in a heart transplant recipient treated successfully with a miltefosine-containing regimen: Case report and review of the literature. Disseminated acanthamoebiasis is a rare, often fatal, infection most commonly affecting immunocompromised patients. We report a case involving sinuses, skin, and bone in a 60-year-old woman 5Â months after heart transplantation. She improved with a combination of flucytosine, fluconazole, miltefosine, and decreased immunosuppression. To our knowledge, this is the first case of successfully treated disseminated acanthamoebiasis in a heart transplant recipient and only the second successful use of miltefosine for this infection among solid organ transplant recipients. Acanthamoeba infection should be considered in transplant recipients with evidence of skin, central nervous system, and sinus infections that are unresponsive to antibiotics. Miltefosine may represent an effective component of a multidrug therapeutic regimen for the treatment of this amoebic infection. '\nAcanthamoeba\n', 'heart transplant', 'miltefosine'
