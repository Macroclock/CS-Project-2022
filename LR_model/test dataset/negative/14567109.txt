[15-year-old patient with decompensated heart failure and tachycardia with negative P-waves in inferior ECG recordings. An indication for heart transplantation?]. A 15-year-old girl was admitted with signs of severe cardiac failure. There were no symptoms of cardiac insufficiency 4 weeks before hospital admission. She presented with permanent supraventricular tachycardia with negative P-waves in leads II, III and aVF, the heart rate was 150 beats per minute. The electrophysiological examination showed a permanent junctional reentry tachycardia. A postero-septal accessory pathway could be eliminated successfully by radiofrequency catheter ablation. Immediately after the procedure cardiac function deteriorated with slight decrease of the strongly reduced cardiac output. Intensive care and application of dobutamine led to clinical stability. During a follow-up of two years the young patient showed permanent sinus rhythm and an age related physical strain. This case report documents the rapid and severe manifestation of cardiac failure owing to permanent junctional reentry tachycardia in a 15-year-old girl. She was referred for consideration of heart transplantation. Invasive electrophysiological treatment led to permanent sinus rhythm with improvement of left ventricular function.
