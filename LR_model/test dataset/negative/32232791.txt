Cardiovascular magnetic resonance-derived myocardial strain in asymptomatic heart transplanted patients and its correlation with late gadolinium enhancement. To investigate whether cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)-derived myocardial strains were abnormal in asymptomatic heart transplant (HT) patients with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and to detect the relationship between CMR-derived myocardial strain parameters and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in asymptomatic HT patients. A total of 72 HT patients and 35 healthy volunteers underwent 1.5-T MR scanning. The examination protocol included basic cine imaging and LGE. The deformation registration algorithm (DRA) and feature tracking (FT) software were used for the strain analyses. Myocardial strain measurements included left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS), LV global circumferential strain (LVGCS), LV global radial strain (LVGRS) and right ventricular longitudinal strain (RVLS). Compared with healthy volunteers, HT patients had significantly decreased DRA- and FT- derived myocardial strain measurements (all p < 0.05). There was a significant correlation and high reproducibility between the DRA- and FT-derived strain parameters. Both CMR-derived LVGLS and LVGRS were significantly related to the presence of LGE, and multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that the LVGLS measurement obtained from both techniques was independently associated with the presence of LGE. The odds ratios (ORs) for DRA- and FT-LVGLS were 1.340 and 1.342, respectively. Asymptomatic HT patients with preserved LVEF exhibited reduced myocardial strain parameters. The CMR-derived LVGLS was independently related to the presence of LGE in HT patients. • Reduced myocardial strain parameters were found in asymptomatic heart transplanted (HT) patients with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). • The deformation registration algorithm (DRA) and feature tracking (FT)-derived strains in asymptomatic HT patients had high reproducibility. • DRA- and FT-derived LVGLS had an independent relationship with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in asymptomatic HT patients.
