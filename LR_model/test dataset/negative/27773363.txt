[Heart transplantation for the treatment of isolated left ventricular myocardial noncompaction. First case in Mexico]. Myocardial noncompaction of the left ventricle is a congenital cardiomyopathy characterised by left ventricular hypertrabeculation and prominent intertrabecular recesses. The incidence ranges from 0.15% to 2.2%. Clinical manifestations include heart failure, arrhythmias, and stroke. Prognosis is fatal in most cases. Heart transplantation is a therapeutic option for this cardiomyopathy, and few had been made worldwide. The case is presented of a 20 year-old male with noncompacted myocardium of the left ventricle, who had clinical signs of heart failure. His functional class was IV on the New York Heart Association scale. He was successfully transplanted. Its survival to 15 months is optimal in class I New York Heart Association, and endomyocardial biopsies have been reported without evidence of acute rejection. It is concluded that heart transplantation modified the natural history and improved survival in patients with this congenital heart disease.
