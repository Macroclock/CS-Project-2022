Use of pediatric Berlin Heart EXCOR biventricular device as a bridge to retransplantation in a 10-month-old infant with acute graft failure after cardiac transplantation. We report the implantation of the Berlin Heart EXCOR (Berlin Heart, Berlin, Germany) as a pediatric biventricular assist device in a 10-month-old boy with primary graft failure after cardiac transplantation. The EXCOR was successfully used as a bridge to cardiac retransplantation. The pneumatically driven paracorporeal device supported the patient for 165 days until another suitable heart was obtained.
