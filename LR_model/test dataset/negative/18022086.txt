Patterns and predictors of physical functional disability at 5 to 10 years after heart transplantation. Researchers have not examined relationships between perception of physical functional disability and demographic, clinical, and psychological variables at 5 to 10 years after heart transplantation. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to describe physical functional disability over time and identify predictors of physical functional disability from 5 to 10 years after heart transplantation. The study enrolled 555 patients who were between 5 and 10 years post-heart transplant (age, 54 +/- 9 years; 78% male, 88% white, 79% married). Patients completed 6 instruments that measure physical functional disability and factors that may impact physical functional disability. Statistical analyses included calculation of frequencies, means +/- standard deviation (plotted over time), Pearson correlation coefficients, and multiple regression coupled with repeated measures. Between 5 and 10 years after heart transplantation, physical functional disability was low, and 34% to 45% of patients reported having no functional disability. More physical functional disability was associated with having more symptoms, having depression/mood/negative affect and lower use of negative coping strategies, having more comorbidities and more specific comorbidities (e.g., more orthopedic problems and diabetes); higher New York Heart Association functional class; having more acute rejection, infection, or cardiac allograft vasculopathy; being female, older, less educated, and unemployed; higher body mass index; and more hospital readmissions (explaining 46% of variance [F = 84.75, p < 0.0001]). Demographic, clinical, and psychological factors were significantly related to physical functional disability. Knowledge of these factors provides the basis for development of therapeutic plans of care.
