Successful Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C Infection With Direct-Acting Antivirals in a Heart Transplant Recipient: A Case Report. Heart transplant (HT) recipients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are noted to have higher rates of HCV related morbidity and mortality. Treatment of HCV in the past was fraught with low cure rates, increased risk of graft rejection, and medication-related side effects. We report a case of successful treatment of HCV infection in a HT recipient. The patient was found to have HCV during his pretransplant workup. He underwent uneventful orthotopic HT in 2000. The HCV infection was monitored with regular liver enzymes and the surveillance liver biopsies at 2 and 5 years after HT showed mild but stable liver disease, and he stayed on chronic immunosuppression. He was not offered interferon-based HCV therapy because of the risk of steroid-resistant graft failure and cardiac decompensation. With the availability of the new direct-acting antivirals (DAA) for HCV infection, and worsening of liver fibrosis on noninvasive testing, we treated him with sofosbuvir and simeprevir for 12 weeks. During treatment, he remained clinically stable from a cardiac standpoint and he showed biochemical improvement in his liver and renal functions. Tacrolimus levels remained stable and did not require any dose adjustment. He showed rapid virologic response and subsequently achieved sustained virologic response at 12 weeks. DAA use was safe and effective in treating HCV infection in a HT recipient.
