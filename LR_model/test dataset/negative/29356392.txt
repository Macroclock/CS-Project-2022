Transvenous dual-chamber pacemaker after paediatric heart transplantation using left ventricle pacing through the coronary sinus. A 12-year-old child with end-stage heart failure due to restrictive cardiomyopathy was submitted to orthotopic heart transplantation. Primary graft dysfunction required venous arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. Heart function normalized, but complete atrioventricular block remained after 3Â weeks. A dual-chamber pacing with transvenous left ventricle pacing through the coronary sinus was performed. At 5-year follow-up, the patient is stable with the same pacing system and with preserved ventricular function. 'Atrioventricular block', 'Children', 'Heart failure', 'Heart transplantation'
