Impella 2.5 assisted balloon aortic valvuloplasty and percutaneous coronary intervention as a bridge to heart transplantation. Percutaneous left ventricular assist device (pLVAD) utilization is increasing as the potential applications expand. We report a case of high-risk balloon aortic valvuloplasty and percutaneous coronary intervention using the Impella 2.5 pLVAD in a patient with severely depressed left ventricular function as a bridge to heart transplantation.
