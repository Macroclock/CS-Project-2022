[Current Status and Future Aspects of Heart Transplantation in Japan]. By renewal of Japanese Organ Transplantation Act on 17th July in 2010, organs can be donated after brain death with consent from their family, if he or she did not deny organ donation and brain dead organ donation increased from 10 to 50 cases in a year. Despite of an increase of heart transplantation (HTx), a waiting period for HTx has become longer because more candidates for HTx have been registered to Japan Organ Transplant Network. By renewal of the act, organ donation from brain dead children can be performed since then and pediatric left ventricular assist device, EXCOR was finally accepted to use in August 1st, 2015. However, only 3 children under 6 years of age have donated since then and oversea HTx increased again.
