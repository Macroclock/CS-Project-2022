Dual blockade of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibits posttransplant Epstein-Barr virus B cell lymphomas and promotes allograft survival. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a serious complication of organ transplantation that often manifests as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated B cell lymphomas. Current treatments for PTLD have limited efficacy and can be associated with graft rejection or systemic toxicities. The mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, suppresses tumor growth of EBV+ B cell lymphoma cells in vitro and in vivo; however, the efficacy is limited and clinical benefits of mTOR inhibitors for PTLD are variable. Here, we show constitutive activation of multiple nodes within the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in EBV+ PTLD-derived cell lines. Inhibition of either PI3K or Akt, with specific inhibitors CAL-101 and MK-2206, respectively, diminished growth of EBV+ B cell lines from PTLD patients in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, rapamycin combined with CAL-101 or MK-2206 had a synergistic effect in suppressing cell growth as determined by IC 'basic (laboratory) research/science', 'immunosuppressant-mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)', 'immunosuppression/immune modulation', 'infection and infectious agents-viral: Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)', 'infectious disease', 'posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)'
