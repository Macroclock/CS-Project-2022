Repeat heart-lung transplantation outcome in the United States. This study compared risk-adjusted survival between primary and repeat heart-lung transplantation. Data for 799 primary heart-lung and 19 repeat heart-lung transplants were extracted from the United Network Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry. Analyses were based on propensity score matching in which 1, 2, and 3 primary transplant patients were matched with 19 repeat transplant patients. The matching variables were sex of recipient and donor, ethnicity, race, age of recipient and donor, cytomegalovirus status, ABO match, human leukocyte antigen mismatch, medical condition (hospitalized), ventilator, employment status, functional status, UNOS transplant status, and ischemic time. Propensity score matching revealed incomplete overlap of covariate distributions between primary and repeat transplant patients. The 19 repeat heart-lung transplant patients were more severely impaired at the time of transplant, and 4 did not have an adequate primary transplant match. For 15 repeat transplant patients, survival time was not significantly different from matched primary transplant controls. For repeat transplant patients, being Hispanic, having longer ischemic time, poor functional status (needing assistance), being hospitalized, and requiring ventilator support were all associated with decreased survival time; however, only being on a ventilator was statistically significant. By contrast, being female, and younger were associated with increased survival, but were not statistically significant. When matched for a set of potential confounding variables, no difference in survival benefit was observed between primary and repeat heart-lung transplant patients. The only predictor significantly associated with decreased survival time among repeat transplant patients was being on a ventilator.
