Solid organ transplantation in AL amyloidosis. Vital organ failure remains common in AL amyloidosis. Solid organ transplantation is contentious because of the multisystem nature of this disease and risk of recurrence in the graft. We report outcome among all AL patients evaluated at the UK National Amyloidosis Centre who received solid organ transplants between 1984 and 2009. Renal, cardiac and liver transplants were performed in 22, 14 and 9 patients respectively, representing <2% of all AL patients assessed during the period. One and 5-year patient survival was 95% and 67% among kidney recipients, 86% and 45% among heart recipients and 33% and 22% among liver recipients. No renal graft failed due to recurrent amyloid during median (range) follow up of 4.8 (0.2-13.3) years. Median patient survival was 9.7 years among 8/14 cardiac transplant recipients who underwent subsequent stem cell transplantation (SCT) and 3.4 years in six patients who did not undergo SCT (p = 0.01). Amyloid was widespread in all liver transplant recipients. Solid organ transplantation has rarely been performed in AL amyloidosis, but these findings demonstrate feasibility and support a role in selected patients.
