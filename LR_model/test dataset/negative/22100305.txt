Human leukocyte antigen epitope analysis to assess complement- and non-complement-binding donor-specific antibody repertoire in a pediatric heart transplant recipient. This case report summarizes the spectrum of anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibody reactivity determined by single-allele Luminex immunoglobulin G and C1q binding assays before transplant, during an episode of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and following treatment in a sensitized pediatric heart transplant (Tx) recipient. We were able to discriminate between complement- and non-complement-binding epitope-specific antibodies present against a single donor antigen (HLA-A2) during the progression of AMR and its resolution. Our findings illustrate the usefulness of determining antibody specificities against epitopes using various Luminex-based assays.
