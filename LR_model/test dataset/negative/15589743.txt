Role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in murine skin and heart allograft rejection across different antigenic desparities. The factors that influence the relative contribution of the T cell subsets to allograft rejection remain unclear. We compared skin and heart rejection in CD4 Knockout (KO), and CD8 KO mice across full-, minor-, and class II histocompatibility antigen (HA) mismatches. Skin allografts were rejected by either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells alone at any degree of antigenic mismatch. However, either the absence of CD4+ cells or a lesser degree of HA mismatch resulted in prolongation of graft survival. In contrast, fully allogeneic heart grafts were accepted in CD4 KO recipients, and minor HA mismatched heart grafts were accepted by both CD4 KO and CD8 KO mice. Thus, the T cell subsets required for allograft rejection are determined by the immunogenicity of the tissue transplanted. In the absence of CD8+ T cells, perforin and Fas ligand (FasL) but not granzyme B mRNA were detected in rejecting grafts. Thus, granzyme B is a CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-specific effector molecule.
