Donors after circulatory death heart trial. Orthotopic heart transplantation is the gold standard treatment for end-stage heart failure. However, the persistent shortage of available donor organs has resulted in an ever-increasing waitlist and longer waiting periods for transplantation. On the contrary, increasing the number of heart transplants by preserving extended criteria donors and donation after circulatory death hearts with the Organ Care System™ (OCS) Heart System has the potential to provide the gold standard, life-saving treatment to patients with end-stage heart failure. The objective of the Donation After Circulatory Death Heart Trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of the OCS Heart System to preserve and assess hearts donated after circulatory death for transplantation to increase the pool of donor hearts available for transplantation, which can potentially provide patients with end-stage heart failure with the life-saving treatment.
