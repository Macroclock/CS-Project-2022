Hepatitis B core antibody-positive donors in cardiac transplantation: a single-center experience. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) core antibody (HBcAb)-positive donors are increasingly utilized in solid organ transplantation. We report a single center's experience in cardiac transplantation with 18 HBcAb-positive donors. Available follow-up on recipients of cardiac allografts from HBcAb-positive donors, including 2 donors with low-level serum HBV DNA at the time of transplantation, demonstrated no documented donor-derived HBV transmission.
