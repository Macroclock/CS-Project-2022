Donor myocardial HIF-1alpha is an independent predictor of cardiac allograft dysfunction: a 7-year prospective, exploratory study. Knowledge on interplay between the cardiac molecular response to transplantation-induced stress and primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is limited. A cDNA array identified HIF-1, EGR-1, NAB-2, VEGF-A and uPA as mediators of cardiac tissue response to transplantation-induced stress. mRNA expression of these molecules was measured in left ventricular biopsies from 200 donors before and after aortic cross-clamping and at 10-, 30- and 60-min reperfusion by real-time RT-PCR. HIF-1alpha expression at two time points was significantly associated with PGD, as shown by univariate analysis, receiver operating characteristic curve and multivariate logistic regression. At a cut-off level of 200 arbitrary units, HIF-1alpha after aortic cross-clamping in donors (78% sensitivity, 83% specificity) and at 10-min reperfusion (85% sensitivity, 83% specificity) identified PGD. HIF-1alpha demonstrates the potential to be a predictive marker for PGD; however, as multiple factors were tested at different time points, prospective evaluation is clearly necessary to confirm this observation.
