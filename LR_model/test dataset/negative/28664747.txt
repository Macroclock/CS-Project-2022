Association between the heart rate early after heart transplantation and the long term clinical outcomes. A strong correlation between a lower heart rate and survival has been demonstrated in various patient populations. The optimal heart rate for heart transplant patients is still unknown. The aim of our study was to evaluate the association between an early heart rate and survival after heart transplantation. We retrospectively analysed a group of 330 patients, who underwent heart transplantation in our institution from 1994 to 2014 and complete datasets, including 24-hour heart rate monitoring one month after the heart transplantation. Patients were divided in 2 groups: Group A (n = 278) with the average 24-hour heart rate <90 bpm, and Group B (n = 52) with ≥ 90 bpm. The average period of monitoring was 7.5 ± 5.3 years. No differences in baseline characteristics were observed in both groups of recipients and respective donors. One-year survival in groups A and B was 92 % and 81 %, respectively; 5-year survival was 79 % and 60 %, respectively; and 10-year survival was 66 % and 50 %, respectively (p = 0.001). Increased heart rate in the early post-transplant period was significantly associated with a poorer survival rate in patients after heart transplantation (Tab. 2, Fig. 1, Ref. 25).
