Pulmonary Hypertension: The Role of Lung Transplantation. Despite advances in targeted medical therapy, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains a fatal disease because of progressive right ventricular dysfunction. For patients who are refractory to medical therapy, heart-lung and lung transplantation are important treatment options. Because of longer waiting time, surgical interventions including extracorporeal lung support and atrial septostomy can be used in PAH patients bridging to transplantation.
