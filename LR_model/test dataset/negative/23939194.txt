Therapeutic drug monitoring of ciclosporin A and tacrolimus in heart lung transplant patients using dried blood spots. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ciclosporin A (CsA) and tacrolimus is traditionally performed using venous whole blood sampling. A number of reports have described development of ultra high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) methods for the quantitation of CsA and tacrolimus from dried blood spots (DBS), which may offer a convenient alternative. As yet, no such reports have validated this methodology using fingerprick capillary DBS samples collected from transplant patients. Capillary fingerprick DBS were collected from heart and lung transplant patients in a specialist cardiothoracic transplant centre. We utilized our previously published method for the extraction and simultaneous quantitation of CsA and tacrolimus from DBS using UPLC-MS/MS. Drug concentrations measured from DBS were compared to concentrations measured in venous whole blood by our routine clinical UPLC-MS/MS assay. In total, 91 heart or lung transplant patients were enrolled onto the study; 46 patients were on CsA therapy and 45 on tacrolimus therapy. Passing-Bablock analysis demonstrated excellent agreement between capillary fingerprick DBS samples and venous whole blood samples. There was a mean positive bias of 2.6 µg/L (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.2 to 7.5 µg/L) for CsA (n = 45) and mean negative bias of -0.7 µg/L (95% CI -1.1 to -0.3 µg/L) for tacrolimus (n = 42). We demonstrate utility of DBS for serial monitoring of CsA and tacrolimus using UPLC-MS/MS in heart and lung transplant patients. This may offer significant advantages for these patients including the ability to take capillary DBS samples in the community prior to clinic visits.
