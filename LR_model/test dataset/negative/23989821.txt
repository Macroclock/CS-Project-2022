Combined heart transplantation and thoracic endovascular aortic repair for heart failure secondary to tricuspid atresia palliated with Potts shunt. A 57-year-old-man with known tricuspid atresia previously palliated with a Potts shunt had developed progressive heart failure refractory to medical management. He underwent a combined thoracic endovascular stent graft procedure to eliminate the Potts shunt and orthotopic heart transplantation. At 3-month follow-up, right-sided heart function and pulmonary artery pressures as well as pulmonary vascular resistance had normalized, and at 7 months, the patient had returned to normal activity. The surgical management and its principles as well as postoperative follow-up are described.
