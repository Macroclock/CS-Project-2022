Chronic hepatitis E in a heart transplant patient: sofosbuvir and ribavirin regimen not fully effective. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) can induce chronic infections in the case of immunosuppression, which are sometimes not cured with ribavirin. Furthermore, sofosbuvir is a highly potent inhibitor of HCV polymerase and was shown to inhibit HEV genotype-3 replication in vitro. We report here the outcome of sofosbuvir/ribavirin therapy on a chronic HEV infection in a heart transplant recipient non-responder to ribavirin. After 24 weeks, the regimen failed to cure the persistent HEV infection, highlighting the need of therapeutic options for HEV-infected immunosuppressed patients.
