Immunotherapeutic strategy based on anti-OX40L and low dose of IL-2 to prolong graft survival in sensitized mice by inducing the generation of CD4 Alloreactive memory cells play a critical role after a second transplant and are difficult to suppress. This study investigated the effect of an immunotherapeutic strategy that combines anti-OX40L, rapamycin (Rapa), and a low dose of IL-2 in a memory cell-based adoptive model. In this model, the median survival time (MST) of the grafts of the combined treatment group was significantly extended compared to that of the control group and other treatment groups. A similar effect was observed regarding a reduction in memory T cells (Tm) and inflammatory cytokines production. Also, the percentages of Foxp3 'Anti-OX40L', 'Heart transplantation', 'Low dose of IL-2', 'T regulatory cells'
