Lifestyle and health status differ over time in long-term heart transplant recipients. To describe differences in lifestyle and health status across 5 post-transplant periods. The sample consisted of 126 heart transplant recipients (87% men) grouped by time after transplantation: group 1, 12 to 24 months (n= 13); group 2, 25 to 48 months (n= 19); group 3, 49 to 72 months (n=24); group 4, 72 to 96 months (n=27); and group 5, > or =97 months (n=43). Data were obtained using demographic and health status evaluation forms and the Lifestyle Profile-II, which measures physical activity, nutrition, health responsibility, interpersonal relationships, stress management, and spiritual growth. Most often reported lifestyle attributes were spiritual growth and interpersonal relationships. Least often reported was physical activity. Pairwise comparisons revealed that groups 3 (chi2 = 16.4; SD = 4.8; P = .03) and 4 (chi2 = 16.6; SD= 5.8; P = .04) had lower physical activity than group 2 (chi2 = 21.3; SD = 5.2). Health status evaluation revealed that there were no group differences in systolic (P = .46) or diastolic (P = .77) blood pressure. Although creatinine was elevated, there were no group differences (P = .86). High-density lipoprotein was higher than 42 mg/dL in all groups, but there were differences across groups in low-density lipoprotein (P = .003). Groups 1 (chi2 = 139.2; SD = 38.5) and 2 (chi2 = 141.0; SD = 47.8) were different than group 5 (chi2 = 112.9; SD = 36.1; P = .05). There were group differences in cholesterol (P = .002), with lower levels in groups 4 (chi2 = 190.5; SD= 38.6) and 5 (chi2 = 186.3; SD = 37.7) as compared to group 2 (chi2 = 230.8; SD = 66.5). Identifying posttransplant periods in which healthy behaviors and health status may be vulnerable to decline is important for providing ongoing education and psychological support to transplant recipients who manage a complex regimen.
