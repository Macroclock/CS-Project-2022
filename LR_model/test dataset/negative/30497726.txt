Persistent but reversible advanced atrio-ventricular block in a heart transplant man induced by dobutamine stress echocardiography. Dobutamine when used for stress echocardiography (DSE), it rarely causes transient atrio-ventricular (AV) block. We report a heart transplant patient with high cardiovascular risk who developed symptomatic advanced AV block during DSE which persisted after termination of dobutamine administration, necessitating pacemaker implantation. To our knowledge, this is the first published case of persistent high grade AV block in a heart transplant patient induced by DSE.
