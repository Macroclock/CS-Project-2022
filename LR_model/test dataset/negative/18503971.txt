Safety and efficacy of ezetimibe with low doses of simvastatin in heart transplant recipients. Although statins have proven efficacy in lowering lipids and improving survival in heart transplantation (HT) recipients, potential drug interactions may limit efficacy and reduce tolerability. This observational study explored the efficacy and tolerability of ezetimibe (10 mg/day) combined with simvastatin (10 or 20 mg/day) prescribed to HT recipients with intolerance to statins (n = 11) or inadequate lipid control despite high-dose statins (n = 14). Substantial reductions in lipid levels were apparent after 2 months (total cholesterol, -22%; low-density lipoproteins, -28%; triglycerides, -31%) and were maintained at 6 months. Reductions were significant in both subgroups of recipients; the vast majority (12 of 14, 85%) of recipients with a history of statins intolerance were able to tolerate ezetimibe plus low-dose simvastatin. This study provides suggestive evidence that treatment with ezetimibe plus low-dose simvastatin is well tolerated by HT recipients and may be effective for treatment of dyslipidemia in HT recipients with statins intolerance or resistance.
