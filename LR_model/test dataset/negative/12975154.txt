Basal cell carcinomas developing in solid organ transplant recipients: clinicopathologic study of 176 cases. To assess the clinicopathologic features of basal cell carcinomas developing in organ transplant recipients. Case series. University department of dermatology. One hundred forty-six (7.2%) of 2029 transplant recipients followed up in our department who developed 176 histologically proven basal cell carcinomas. One hundred fifty-three random samples of basal cell carcinomas excised from nonimmunosuppressed patients served as controls. Clinical data were gathered from the medical records. Histologic slides were retrospectively reexamined. Basal cell carcinomas developed an average of 6.9 years after transplantation, sooner after heart than kidney transplantation, and showed a relative predilection for heart allograft recipients. The mean age of transplant recipients with basal cell carcinomas was significantly lower than that of controls (54.6 vs 69.8 years), especially for recipients of renal transplants, and a male preponderance was found (male-female ratio, 4.8:1 vs 1.3:1). In both groups, basal cell carcinomas were predominantly found on the head and neck, but extracephalic locations were significantly more frequent in transplant recipients (37.5%) than controls (24.5%). Histologically, superficial basal cell carcinomas were more frequent in transplant recipients than controls (33.6% vs 14.4%). The density of the peritumoral cell infiltrate was lower in tumors from transplant recipients compared with controls. The tumor thickness and the presence of epidermal ulceration did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Basal cell carcinomas in transplant recipients show some clinicopathologic differences from their "ordinary" counterparts, namely, a younger age at development, male preponderance, more frequent distribution in extracephalic sites, and higher frequency of superficial subtypes.
