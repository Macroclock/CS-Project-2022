Global Longitudinal Strain and Left Atrial Volume Index Provide Incremental Prognostic Value in Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. Current methods for predicting adverse events in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are still limited. Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS) and left atrial volume index (LAVI) have been recently proposed as novel prognostic factors in several cardiovascular diseases. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of GLS and LAVI in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed in 427 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (66% men, age 52Â±15 years), and LAVI and GLS were assessed. During follow-up, the primary end point of all-cause mortality, heart transplantation, sudden cardiac death, and appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy was noted. A total of 103 patients reached the primary end point during a follow-up of 6.7 (interquartile range, 3.3-10.0) years. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed GLS and LAVI to be independently associated with the primary end point (hazard ratio GLS, 1.10 [1.03-1.19],  GLS and LAVI are independently associated with adverse outcome in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and may help to optimize risk stratification in these patients.
