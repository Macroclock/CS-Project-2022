Regeneration of heart muscle tissue: quantification of chimeric cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells following transplantation. Persuasive evidence has been recently provided that adult bone marrow (BM) cells exert greater plasticity than previously assumed. This review is focused on the quantification of mixed chimerism (mCh) in the hearts (cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells) of patients after orthotopic heart to heart transplantation (HHT) in comparison to full (unmanipulated) allogeneic BM and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplants. Following a sex-mismatched transplantation constellation heart muscle tissue obtained at autopsy was examined. Evaluation of mCh was most often performed by immunophenotyping combined with fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) applying x- and y-chromosome-specific DNA probes. When comparing our data with the results of former studies that were regularly based on the detection of the y-chromosome alone, the quantity of chimeric cardiomyocytes after HHT ranged from 0% to 9%. On the other hand, after full BM transplantats (chimeric) cardiomyocytes of donor-type origin appeared at an incidence between 0.23% to 6.4%. These disturbing inconsistencies were assumed to be related to methodology: the restriction to the y-chromosome, disregard of the plane of section (detection sensitivity ranging between 35% and 67%) and state of tissue preservation (cadaver hearts). Therefore, when strictly applying dual color FISH and limiting the recognition of chimeric cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells to the presence of two distinctive signals detection sensitivity was significantly enhanced. Contrasting a total congruence with the genotyping in control specimens of normal cadaver hearts, a striking disparity in the extent of mCh was found depending on the different modes of transplantation. After allografting with PBSC a considerably low incidence (1.6%) of chimeric cardiomyocytes was determined contrasting with 5.3% of donor-derived cells after full BM transplants. Following HHT host-type endothelial cells (16.2%) of the intramural and subepicardial vessel walls were more often encountered than following BM and PBSC allografting. These findings are in keeping with the assumption of a sprouting and migration of vascular structures into the donor heart from the site of surgical aligment and injury between retained host and donor atrial walls. When considering the other methods of transplantation (BM, PBSC) the data on chimeric endothelial cells support the hypothesis of a common hemangioblast. Concerning the cardiomyocytes it seems most reasonable to assume that primitive mesenchymal stem cells of the BM play a pivotal role in the development of mCh. This phenomenon is more extensively expressed than previously expected and may be related to an enforced repair of the damaged myocardium during the post-transplant period as the sequel of myeloablative (cardiotoxic) conditioning.
