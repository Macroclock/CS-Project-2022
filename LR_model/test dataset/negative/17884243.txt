Primary cutaneous Epstein-Barr virus-related lymphoproliferative disorders in 4 immunosuppressed children. Primary cutaneous Epstein-Barr virus-related lymphoproliferative disorders are rare. We describe 4 cases in children: two with acquired immunodeficiencies (HIV infection, heart transplantation) and two with congenital immunodeficiencies (ataxia-telangiectasia and an undetermined disease affecting the T lymphocytes). Two of the lymphoproliferative disorders were T-cell types and two were B-cell types. The two T-cell types were also Epstein-Barr virus positive, which is extremely rare. Three of the patients developed extracutaneous disease with poor outcome, resulting in death.
