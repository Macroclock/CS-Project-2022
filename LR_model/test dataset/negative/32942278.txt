Dermatological Disease in Australian Heart and Lung Transplant Recipients. Research examining skin disease in heart and lung transplant recipients in Australia is limited. This study aims to determine the spectrum of skin diseases encountered in Australian heart and lung transplant recipients, their effect on quality of life, and potential risk factors for skin cancer. Ninety-four participants were recruited from an Australian heart and lung transplant centre between March and December 2016. The participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire which included the Dermatology Life Quality Index and were examined for malignant and non-malignant skin disease. The association of study variables with the presence of skin cancer and Dermatology Life Quality Index score were examined using logistic regression analysis. A dermatological diagnosis was made in 82 patients (87%). Actinic keratosis was the most common diagnosis, affecting 50 participants (53%), followed by skin cancer (41; 44%) and warts (14; 15%). Other non-malignant skin diseases were less common. Risk factors associated with skin cancer on multivariate modelling included age at transplantation and a history of â‰¥5 post-transplant skin cancers. Skin disease had a negative effect on the quality of life of a minority of patients. Actinic keratosis and skin cancer are very frequent in Australian heart and lung transplant recipients and more common than non-malignant skin diseases. Routine dermatological surveillance at regular intervals is advised. 'Quality of life', 'Risk factors', 'Skin cancer', 'Skin diseases', 'Transplantation'
