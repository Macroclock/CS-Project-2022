Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome-free survival after lung transplantation: An International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Thoracic Transplant Registry analysis. Lung transplant (LTx) recipients have low long-term survival and a high incidence of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). However, few long-term, multicenter, and precise estimates of BOS-free survival (a composite outcome of death or BOS) incidence exist. This retrospective cohort study of primary LTx recipients (1994-2011) reported to the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation Thoracic Transplant Registry assessed outcomes through 2012. For the composite primary outcome of BOS-free survival, we used Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional hazards regression, censoring for loss to follow-up, end of study, and re-LTx. Although standard Thoracic Transplant Registry analyses censor at the last consecutive annual complete BOS status report, our analyses allowed for partially missing BOS data. Due to BOS reporting standards, 99.1% of the cohort received LTx in North America. During 79,896 person-years of follow-up, single LTx (6,599 of 15,268 [43%]) and bilateral LTx (8,699 of 15,268 [57%]) recipients had a median BOS-free survival of 3.16 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.99-3.30 years) and 3.58 years (95% CI, 3.53-3.72 years), respectively. Almost 90% of the single and bilateral LTx recipients developed the composite outcome within 10 years of transplantation. Standard Registry analyses "overestimated" median BOS-free survival by 0.42 years and "underestimated" the median survival after BOS by about a half-year for both single and bilateral LTx (p < 0.05). Most LTx recipients die or develop BOS within 4 years, and very few remain alive and free from BOS at 10 years post-LTx. Less inclusive Thoracic Transplant Registry analytic methods tend to overestimate BOS-free survival. The Registry would benefit from improved international reporting of BOS and other chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) events.
