Destination therapy: does progress depend on left ventricular assist device development? The role of therapy using mechanical circulatory support devices has evolved rapidly over the last two decades. New developments in the field achieved smaller adverse events, but, currently, only minor improvements in survival were observed in published observational data. The authors discuss the development of mechanical circulatory support devices as a "destination therapy" option for patients who have end-stage heart failure and are ineligible for heart transplantation as it relates to left ventricular assist device development.
