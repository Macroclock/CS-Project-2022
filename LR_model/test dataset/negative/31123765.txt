Impact of Long-Term Support with Berlin Heart EXCOR® in Pediatric Patients with Severe Heart Failure. Berlin Heart EXCOR® (BHE) ventricular assist device (VAD) (Berlin Heart, Berlin Heart AG, Berlin, Germany) implantation is prevalent in patients with severe heart failure. However, clinical outcomes of pediatric patients on long-term BHE support remain mainly unknown. This study aimed to report our clinical experience with long-term support of pediatric patients with severe heart failure supported by BHE VAD. Clinical outcomes of 11 patients (median age 8.4 months; two male), who underwent LVAD implantation of the Berlin Heart EXCO® (BHE) VAD (Berlin Heart, Berlin Heart AG, Berlin, Germany) between 2013 and 2017 at our institution were reviewed. The median support period was 312 (range 45-661) days and five patients were supported for more than 1 year. The longest support duration was 661 days. No mortality occurred, and six patients were successfully bridged to heart transplantation, while three patients were successfully weaned off the device. Two patients are currently on BHE support while they await heart transplantation. Four patients had cerebral bleeding or infarction, but only one case of persistent neurological deficit occurred. No fatal device-related infection occurred during LVAD support. BHE VAD can provide long-term support for pediatric patients with severe heart failure with acceptable mortality and morbidity rates with long-term support.
