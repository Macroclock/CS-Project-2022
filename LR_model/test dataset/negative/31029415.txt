The Effect of Obstructive Sleep Apnea on 3-Year Outcomes in Patients Who Underwent Orthotopic Heart Transplantation. Despite the well-known association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and cardiovascular disease, there is a paucity of data regarding OSA in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients and its effect on clinical outcomes. Hence, we sought to determine the association between OSA, as detected by polysomnography, and late graft dysfunction (LGD) after OHT. In this retrospective review of consecutive OHT recipients from 2012 to 2014 at our center, we examined LGD, i.e., graft failure >1 year after OHT, through competing risks analysis. Due to small sample size and event counts, as well as preliminary testing which revealed statistically similar demographics and outcomes, we pooled patients who had treated OSA with those who had no OSA. Of 146 patients, 29 (20%) had untreated OSA, i.e., OSA without use of continuous positive airway pressure therapy, at the time of transplantation. Patients with untreated OSA were significantly older, heavier, and more likely to have baseline hypertension than those with treated/no OSA. Although there were no differences between groups in regard to short-term complications of acute kidney injury, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, or primary graft dysfunction, there were significant differences in the occurrence of LGD. Those with untreated OSA were at 3 times the risk of developing LGD than those with treated/no OSA (hazard ratio 3.2; 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 7.9; p = 0.01). Because OSA is a common co-morbidity of OHT patients and because patients with untreated OSA have an elevated risk of LGD, screening for and treating OSA should occur during the OHT selection period.
