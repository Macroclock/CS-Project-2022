[Effect of berberin hydrochloride on blood concentration of cyclosporine A in cardiac transplanted recipients]. To observe the clinic effect of combined use of berberin hydrochloride (Ber) with cyclosporine A (CsA) on the blood concentration of CsA in heart transplanted recipients. The blood concentration of CsA, liver-renal function and blood lipids in 22 heart transplanted recipients, who received Ber-CsA combined therapy, were measured. The whole blood steady state concentration of CsA, C0 and C2, in recipients after being treated with Ber-CsA significantly increased than those before applying Ber-CsA (P < 0.01), with the mean increment of 26% and 18% respectively; the dosage of CsA used decreased in 21 patients by 25-100 mg/d; and the Ber-CsA showed no significant effect on liver-renal function or blood lipids (P > 0.05). Combined use of CsA with Ber could markedly increase the blood concentration of CsA in heart transplanted recipients and reduce the dosage of CsA required, save the fee for medical service, and shows no obvious adverse reaction.
