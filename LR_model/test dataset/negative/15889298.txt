A case of Aspergillus mediastinitis after heart transplantation successfully treated with liposomal amphotericin B, caspofungin and voriconazole. Reported here is a case of mediastinitis caused by Aspergillus fumigatus and Staphylococcus epidermidis following a heart transplantation that was successfully treated with amphotericin B in combination with new antifungal drugs (caspofungin and voriconazole), antibiotics and superficial wound drainage. A review of the literature revealed that Aspergillus as a cause of mediastinitis has been rarely described. In the few existing reports, evolution was generally fatal, especially in immunocompromised patients, despite treatment with antifungal drugs and surgery.
