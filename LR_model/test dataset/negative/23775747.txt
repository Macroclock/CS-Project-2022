The detection of antibodies to the Angiotensin II-type 1 receptor in transplantation. The detection of auto-antibodies detection is a major aspect of patient's immunomonitoring. Antibodies directed against the heart and kidney Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) play a major role in antibody mediated rejection after heart and kidney transplantation and in obliterative vasculopathy of autoimmune diseases. Here, a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the reliable tool for the detection of auto-antibodies targeting AT1R.
