Multilevel factors are associated with immunosuppressant nonadherence in heart transplant recipients: The international BRIGHT study. Factors at the level of family/healthcare worker, organization, and system are neglected in medication nonadherence research in heart transplantation (HTx). The 4-continent, 11-country cross-sectional Building Research Initiative Group: Chronic Illness Management and Adherence in Transplantation (BRIGHT) study used multistaged sampling to examine 36 HTx centers, including 36 HTx directors, 100 clinicians, and 1397 patients. Nonadherence to immunosuppressants-defined as any deviation in taking or timing adherence and/or dose reduction-was assessed using the Basel Assessment of Adherence to Immunosuppressive Medications Scale 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical research/practice', 'compliance/adherence', 'heart transplantation/cardiology', 'immunosuppression/immune modulation', 'social sciences'
