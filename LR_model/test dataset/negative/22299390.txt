The role of speckle tracking imaging in the noninvasive detection of acute rejection after heterotopic cardiac transplantation in rats. Acute cardiac allograft rejection continues to be the cause of graft loss and contributes to the morbidity and mortality after cardiac transplantation. Repetitive endomyocardial biopsies are necessary to monitor the effects of immunosuppressants after cardiac transplantation. In this study, we investigate whether speckle tracking imaging (STI) is a valuable method in assessing acute cardiac rejection. Hearts from Brown Norway rats or Lewis rats were transplanted into other Brown Norway rats. Isografts and groups of allografts, either untreated or treated with cyclosporine A (CsA) at a low dose (3 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) or a high dose (10 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)), were compared 7 days after transplantation. Echocardiography-derived left ventricular post wall thickness was increased only in untreated allografts.The left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly lower in the allografts compared with the isografts, but allografts treated without or with low-dose CsA showed similar results. The radial velocity and systolic radial strain rate showed a lower value in untreated allografts than other grafts, but there is no significant difference between allografts treated with high- or low-dose CsA and isografts. The circumferential strain and circumferential strain rate were comparable among the 4 groups. However, the radial strain exhibited a clear gradient in these groups (2.8 +/- 1.3 in untreated allografts, 5.2 +/- 10.9 in allografts treated with low-dose CsA, 6.3 +/- 1.8 in allografts treated with high-dose CsA, and 12.7 +/- 7.9 in isografts, P < 0.001). STI is able to offer a noninvasive method for detecting transplant allograft rejection.
