Hypertension after pediatric cardiac transplantation: detection, etiology, implications and management. While it may rescue children with end-stage heart failure from impending catastrophe, cardiac transplantation leaves 50-70% of pediatric recipients with new-onset hypertension. Given the unique vulnerability of the heart and kidneys in these children, we can expect long-term uncontrolled hypertension to shorten both graft and patient survival. In this review we discuss the multi-factorial etiology of post-transplant hypertension, highlighting current uncertainties and emphasizing mechanisms specific to cardiac recipients. We consider the optimal means of monitoring BP and in particular, the advantages of 24 h-ABP over intermittent clinic measurements. We also review BP treatment after cardiac transplantation, drawing attention to specific cautions appropriate when prescribing antihypertensive agents in these circumstances.
