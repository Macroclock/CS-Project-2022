IRF4 ablation in B cells abrogates allogeneic B cell responses and prevents chronic transplant rejection. B cells contribute to chronic transplant rejection by producing donor-specific antibodies and promoting T cell response, but how these processes are regulated at the transcriptional level remains unclear. Herein, we investigate the role of transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) in controlling B cell response during chronic transplant rejection. We generated the Irf4 IRF4 is dynamically expressed at different stages of B cell development and is absent in germinal center (GC) B cells. However, IRF4 ablation in the B cell lineage primarily eliminates GC B cells in both naïve and NP-KLH immunized mice. In the transplantation setting, IRF4 functions intrinsically in B cells and governs allogeneic B cell responses at multiple levels, including GC B cell generation, plasma cell differentiation, donor-specific antibody production, and support of T cell response. B cell-specific IRF4 deletion combined with transient CTLA4-Ig treatment abrogates acute and chronic cardiac allograft rejection in naïve recipient mice but not in donor skin-sensitized recipients. B cells require IRF4 to mediate chronic transplant rejection. IRF4 ablation in B cells abrogates allogeneic B cell responses and may also inhibit the ability of B cells to prime allogenic T cells. Targeting IRF4 in B cells represents a potential therapeutic strategy for eliminating chronic transplant rejection.
