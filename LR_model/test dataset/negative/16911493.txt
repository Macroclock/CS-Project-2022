Adherence in adolescents and young adults following heart or heart-lung transplantation. To assess the prevalence and some potential correlates of non-adherence to medications in adolescent and young adult transplant patients. Fifty patients who had undergone heart or heart-lung transplantation 1.4-14.9 yr (mean 8.8 yr) previously completed the Beliefs about Medication Questionnaire (BMQ), Perceived Illness Experience (PIE) scale and a demographics questionnaire. Medical notes were reviewed for information regarding previous psychiatric referral, rejection episodes and complications and noted concerns about adherence. Forty (80%) completed questionnaires were received. Non-adherence determined from the questionnaires was associated with forgetting to take medication and was classified as unintentional non-adherence. Such non-adherence was reported by 11 (28%) patients. Seven patients (18%) showed evidence from their records of deliberate non-adherence, which was classified as intentional. Whilst intentional non-adherence was associated with depression and transplant-related lymphoma, unintentional non-adherence and perceived difficulties with medications were associated with high scores on the PIE preoccupation with illness and BMQ concerns subscale and with drinking alcohol. Future research is required to determine whether unintentional non-adherence results in significant medical complications in the longer term and how a reduction in the prevalence of non-adherence can be facilitated.
