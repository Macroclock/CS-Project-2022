Elevated Heart Rate and Survival in Children With Dilated Cardiomyopathy: A Multicenter Study From the Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry. Background In adults with heart failure, elevated heart rate is associated with lower survival. We determined whether an elevated heart rate was associated with an increased risk of death or heart transplant in children with dilated cardiomyopathy. Methods and Results The study is an analysis of the Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry and includes baseline data, annual follow-up, and censoring events (transplant or death) in 557 children (51% male, median age 1.8 years) with dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosed between 1994 and 2011. An elevated heart rate was defined as 2 or more SDs above the mean heart rate of children, adjusted for age. The primary outcomes were heart transplant and death. Heart rate was elevated in 192 children (34%), who were older (median age, 2.3 versus 0.9 years;  'dilated cardiomyopathy', 'heart rate', 'pediatric'
