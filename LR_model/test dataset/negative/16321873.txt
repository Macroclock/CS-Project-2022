Development of hairy cell leukemia in a patient after cardiac transplantation. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are well-recognized complications of bone marrow and solid organ transplantation, comprising a heterogenous group of lymphoproliferations with a spectrum of morphologic, phenotypic and molecular features. Although PTLDs are usually Epstein-Barr virus-driven B-cell lymphoproliferations, T/natural killer-cell lymphoproliferations, multiple myeloma, and Hodgkin's lymphoma are also recognized as part of the PTLD spectrum. Hairy cell leukemia, a low-grade B-cell lymphoproliferation, has not been recognized as part of the PTLD spectrum. We report the first case of hairy cell leukemia occurring after cardiac transplantation. It is unclear whether this case, similar to other cases of low-grade B-cell lymphoproliferations reported after transplantation, is related to immunosuppression and therefore part of the spectrum of PTLDs, or merely represents coincidental event occurring in an immunocompromised patient.
