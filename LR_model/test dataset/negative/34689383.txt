Decreased frequency of transplantation and lower post-transplant survival free of re-transplantation in LVAD patients with the new heart transplant allocation system. To evaluate the effect of the new heart transplant (HT) allocation system in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) supported patients listed as bridge to transplantation (BTT). Adult patients who were listed for HT between October 18, 2016 and October 17, 2019, and were supported with an LVAD, enrolled in the UNOS database were included in this study. Patients were classified in the old or new system if they were listed or transplanted before or after October 18, 2018, respectively. A total of 3261 LVAD patients were listed for transplant. Of these, 2257 were classified in the old and 1004 in the new system. The cumulative incidence of death or removal from the transplant list due to worsening clinical status at 360-days after listing was lower in the new system (4% vs. 7%, P = .011). LVAD Patients listed in the new system had a lower frequency of transplantation within 360-days of listing (52% vs. 61%, P < .001). A total of 1843 LVAD patients were transplanted, 1004 patients in the old system and 839 patients in the new system. The post-transplant survival at 360 days was similar between old and new systems (92.3% vs. 90%, P = .08). However, LVAD patients transplanted in the new system had lower frequency of the combined endpoint, freedom of death or re-transplantation at 360 days (92.2% vs. 89.6%, P = .046). The new HT allocation system has affected the LVAD-BTT population significantly. On the waitlist, LVAD patients have a decreased cumulative frequency of transplantation and a concomitant decrease in death or delisting due to worsening status. In the new system, LVAD patients have a decreased survival free of re-transplantation at 360 days post-transplant.
