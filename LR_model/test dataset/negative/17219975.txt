Expression of cytokines in acute heart transplantation rejection. The expression and changes of local cytokines network were detected in heart transplantation in rats, so as to determine the role of cytokines in the acute rejection of rats of heart transplantation. Allografts were divided into 4 groups (n=12 in each group): group A (control), group B (IL-2 monoclonal antibody-treated), group C (CsA-treated) and group D (IL-2 monoclonal antibody+CsA-treated). Hearts from DA rats were transplanted into a cervical location in Wistar recipients. The local expression of IL-1beta, IL-2, CD25, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, 1L-10, TNFalpha and INFgamma was detected at day 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 14 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that the survival time of allografts was 8.3+/-1.7, 29.2+/-7.1 (P<0.05), 26.4+/-5.7 (P<0.05) and 55.0+/-10.6 (P<0.01) days respectively in groups A, B, C and D. The expression of IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-10 and IFNgamma was up-regulated, and that of IL-2, CD25, IL-5, IL-6 and TNFalpha was significantly inhibited in group A; The expression of IL-10, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10 and IFNgamma was up-regulated, and that of IL-2, L-4 and TNFalpha was significantly down-regulated in group B; The expression of IL-1beta, IL-2, CD25, IL-5, TNFalpha and IFNgamma was up-regulated, and that of IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 was significantly down-regulated in group C; The expression of IL-14, 11-5, IL-6 and 11-10 was up-regulated, and that of IL-10, IL-2, CD25, TNFalpha and IFNgamma was significantly down-regulated in group D. In conclusion, cytokines play an important role in the development of acute transplantation rejection. Different cytokines play different roles in different local environments.
