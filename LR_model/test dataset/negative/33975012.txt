Analysis of therapeutic potential of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells in cardiac allotransplantation. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) are attractive immune cells to induce immune tolerance. To explore a strategy for improving the efficacy of MDSC therapies, we examined the impact of adoptive transfer of several types of MDSCs on graft rejection in a murine heart transplantation model. We analyzed the effects of induced syngeneic and allogeneic bone marrow-derived MDSCs (BM-MDSCs) on graft survival and suppressive capacity. We also compared the ability of syngeneic monocytic MDSCs (Mo-MDSCs) and polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) to inhibit graft rejection and investigated the suppression mechanisms. Both syngeneic and allogeneic donor- or allogeneic third-party-derived BM-MDSCs prolonged graft survival, although syngeneic BM-MDSCs inhibited anti-donor immune responses most effectively in vitro. Syngeneic Mo-MDSCs, rather than PMN-MDSCs, were responsible for immune suppression through downregulating inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and expanded naturally occurring thymic originated Treg (nTreg) in vitro. Adoptive transfer of Mo-MDSCs, but not PMN-MDSCs, prolonged graft survival and increased Treg infiltration into the graft heart. Recipient-derived Mo-MDSCs are most effective in prolonging graft survival via inhibiting T cell response and nTreg infiltration.
