Berlin heart ventricular assist device as a long-term bridge to transplantation in a Fontan patient with failing single ventricle. The use of VADs as a BTT in children with heart failure has increased due to enhanced device design and reliability, leading to improved survival, functional capacity, and quality of life. However, the use of VADs in patients with Fontan physiology as a BTT is rare with few case reports. Here, we describe a case of implantation of the Berlin VAD as a BTT for 179 days, one of the longest reported periods of mechanical support, in a child with failing single ventricle.
