Current status of heart transplantation in Taiwan. We reviewed the national results of heart transplantation in Taiwan. From July 1987 to December 2012, 1354 patients underwent heart transplantation in 18 qualified heart centers in Taiwan. The transplantation volume and survival rate were reviewed. The median age of recipients was 49 years at surgery, with 37% in the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT)-1A, 30% in ISHLT-1B, and 32% in ISHLT-2. The allograft 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 78%, 68%, 61%, and 47%, respectively. Mostly difficult recipients were bridged by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) instead of ventricular assist device (VAD). The results of heart transplantation in Taiwan are comparable with ISHLT world results. In Taiwan, we use more ECMO than VAD for mechanical circulatory support to bridge critical recipients to heart transplantation.
