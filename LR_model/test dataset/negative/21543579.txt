Fatal invasive infection with fungemia due to Microascus cirrosus after heart and lung transplantation in a patient with cystic fibrosis. Scopulariopsis species are rarely but increasingly recognized as opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised patients. We report on a patient suffering from cystic fibrosis who developed disseminated fungal infection due to a rare Scopulariopsis species, Microascus cirrosus, after heart and lung transplantation. Despite antifungal combination therapy with voriconazole and caspofungin, the patient died 4 weeks after transplantation. Diagnostic difficulties and optimal management of disseminated Scopulariopsis/Microascus infections are discussed.
