Prolonged cardiac xenograft survival in guinea pig-to-rat model by a highly active cobra venom factor. A highly active cobra venom factor (CVF) was isolated from the venom of Naja kaouthia by sequential column chromatography. It displays strong anticomplementary activity, and has 1515 U of anticomplementary activity per mg protein. A single dose of 0.1 mg/kg CVF given i.v. to rats completely abrogated complement activity for nearly 5 days. Given 0.02 mg/kg of CVF, the complement activity of rats was reduced by more than 96.5% in 6 h. In guinea pig-to-rat heart transplant model, rats treated with a single dose of 0.05 mg/kg CVF had significantly prolonged xenograft survival (56.12+/-6.27 h in CVF-treated rats vs. 0.19+/-0.07 h in control rats, P<0.001).
