Heart Transplantation of a Preterm Infant With HLHS. A 33-week gestation, 1.75-kg female infant with mitral stenosis/aortic atresia variant of hypoplastic left heart syndrome and severe ventriculo-coronary connections underwent surgical septectomy and bilateral pulmonary artery banding at five weeks of age (2.10 kg). After separation from bypass, she developed hemodynamic instability requiring venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. She was listed for heart transplantation and transplanted after three days of support with an oversized heart (4.7:1 donor-recipient weight ratio).
