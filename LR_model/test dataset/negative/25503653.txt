Is the internal jugular vein or femoral vein a better approach site for endomyocardial biopsy in heart transplant recipients? Scheduled serial endomyocardial biopsies are executed by an internal jugular vein (IJV) or femoral vein (FV) approach to survey acute rejection after heart transplantation (HTx). However, a better approach site is needed. A total of 379 sessions consisting of 329 IJV approaches and 50 FV approaches in 48 HTx recipients executed at 75 Â± 127 days (41182 days) after HTx between September 2007 and April 2014 at University of Tokyo Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The IJV approach had shorter operation and radiation exposure times, and a lower dose of radiation exposure and lower usage of contrast agents than the FV approach (all P < 0.001). There were no fatal complications requiring surgical management or resulting in death during all sessions. The IJV approach had less complications than the FV approach (2.7% versus 10.0%, P = 0.011). Among the complications, atrial tachyarrhythmia occurred only with the IJV approach (0.9%), whereas transient ventricular tachyarrhythmia and bundle branch block were more frequently observed in the FV approach (8.0% versus 0.9%, P = 0.042). In conclusion, endomyocardial biopsy from the IJV approach was safer and less invasive than that of the FV approach if we only consider the incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmia.
