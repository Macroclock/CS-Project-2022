Report of the first U.S. patient successfully supported long term with the LionHeart completely implantable left ventricular assist device system. We report our first successful long-term survivor in the United States with the LionHeart (Arrow International, Inc., Reading, PA) completely implantable left ventricular assist device system. The patient was initially deemed a poor candidate for cardiac transplantation and had inotrope-dependent, end-stage cardiac failure. The patient was supported for 13 months with this system. During this period of support, the patient returned to independent living and derived obvious benefits toward his daily activities with the completely implanted system. The device proved to be reliable during this period of support. Through lifestyle modification, the patient was ultimately deemed an appropriate candidate for heart transplantation and ultimately received successful transplantation.
