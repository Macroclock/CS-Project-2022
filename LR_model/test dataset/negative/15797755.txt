Functional heme oxygenase-1 promoter polymorphism in relation to heart failure and cardiac transplantation. We investigated the functional promoter repeat polymorphism (GT)(n) in the oxidative stress-induced enzyme heme oxygenase-1 in relation to heart failure and complications after transplantation. No influence of the polymorphism on the development of heart failure, graft survival, acute rejection, or transplant atherosclerosis was found.
