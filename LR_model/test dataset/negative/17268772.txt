Neuronal imaging using SPECT. 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy is one of only a few methods available for objective evaluation of cardiac sympathetic function at a clinical level. Disorders in cardiac sympathetic function play an important role in various heart diseases, and MIBG provides an abundance of useful information for evaluation of disease severity, prognosis, and therapeutic effects; this information is of particular value in patients with heart failure, ischemic heart diseases, or arrhythmic disorders. On the other hand, the quantitative indices for MIBG differ between institutions, and evidence has not been sufficiently well established for MIBG, compared with myocardial perfusion imaging, in ischemic heart diseases. In view of these difficulties, this review provides fundamental information regarding MIBG, its usefulness for various diseases and future difficulties.
