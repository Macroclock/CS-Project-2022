Non-immune risk predictors of cardiac allograft vasculopathy: Results from the U.S. organ procurement and transplantation network. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) remains a major long-term complication in heart transplant (HT) recipients related to increased mortality. We aimed to identify non-immune recipient- and donor-related risk factors for the development of CAV in HT patients. 40,647 recipients, prospectively enrolled from April 1995 to January 2019 in the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), were analyzed after exclusion of pediatric patients, those with missing information on CAV, and re-transplantation. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analyses were performed to identify recipient- and donor-related risk factors for CAV. 5-year population attributable risk for classical cardiovascular risk factors was calculated to estimate the recipients' CAV risk. Analyses were based on OPTN data (June 30, 2019). Of 40,647 post-transplant patients, 14,698 (36.2%) developed CAV with a higher incidence in males (37.3%) than in females (32.6%) (p < 0.001). The mean follow-up time was 68.2 months. In recipients, male sex, African American and Asian ethnicity, ischemic cardiomyopathy, body mass index and smoking were associated with CAV occurrence. In donors, older age, male sex, smoking, diabetes and arterial hypertension were related to CAV. Results remained fairly stable after analysis of different time periods. 5-year attributable CAV risk for classical cardiovascular risk factors was 9.1%. In this large registry with known limitations concerning data completeness, CAV incidence was higher in males than in females. Next to male sex and donor age, the classical cardiovascular risk factors were related to incident CAV. Classical cardiovascular risk factors played only a minor role for the 5-year attributable CAV risk.
