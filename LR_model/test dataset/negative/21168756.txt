Transcatheter aortic valve implantation in a heart transplant recipient: a case report. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has evolved into a feasible therapeutic option for the management of selected patients with severe aortic stenosis and high or prohibitive risk for standard surgery. Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis occasionally occurs in the allograft long after heart transplantation. Because of specific characteristics and comorbidities of heart transplant recipients, these patients may be considered candidates for this less invasive approach. We report a first case of successful transapical TAVI in a heart transplant recipient with symptomatic severe calcific aortic valvular disease and relevant comorbidities long after heart transplantation.
