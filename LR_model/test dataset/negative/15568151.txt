Perioperative hemodynamic measurements with an implantable monitoring system (Chronicle) in a patient with severe heart failure undergoing non-cardiac surgery. A 53-year-old male patient with severe chronic heart failure due to ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF 25%) awaiting heart transplantation was admitted for resection of a bladder tumor. The patient underwent implantation of a Chronicle implantable hemodynamic monitor (IHM) two years before. Thus, perioperative monitoring of heart rate, right ventricular systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure, dP/dt and estimated pulmonary artery diastolic pressure through a lead implanted in the right ventricle was performed. In the postoperative period the patient developed low-output syndrome requiring catecholamine treatment. The patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation uneventfully the same day. However, he developed symptomatic and hemodynamic worsening of heart failure shortly after reduction of inotropes and required prolonged medical treatment with catecholamines. Patients with cardiac disease are known to be at increased risk for cardiovascular complications after noncardiac surgery. Therefore, it has been suggested that such patients could potentially benefit from perioperative invasive hemodynamic monitoring. For the first time, we report a case of perioperative continuous hemodynamic monitoring with a long term-implanted device in a potential heart transplant patient.
