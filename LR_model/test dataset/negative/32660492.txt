Heart-lung transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and giant pulmonary artery aneurysm - case report. Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a rare condition that requires lung transplantation in patients' refractory to medical therapy. Pulmonary artery aneurysm (PAA) is a documented complication of IPAH however, optimal management and timing of intervention for this rare entity is not well understood. We report a case of a 51-year-old female who underwent heart-lung transplantation for IPAH and giant PAA. The extreme size of the PAA and underlying pathology encountered in this case precluded both lung transplantation and conventional aneurysm repair. This case demonstrates that heart-lung transplantation is a good surgical option for IPAH complicated by giant sized PAA and right heart failure.
