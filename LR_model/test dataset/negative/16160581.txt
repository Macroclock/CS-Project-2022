Implantable left ventricular assist devices. The first bridge to transplant with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was preformed over 20 years ago. Since that time, the devices have continued to evolve and now patients are being supported with devices as an alternative to transplantation. The primary indication of end-stage heart failure remains the same but increased knowledge about patient selection, the timing of implant, and patient management have contributed to improved outcomes with decreasing adverse events. Multiorgan failure, right ventricular failure, bleeding, infection, thromboembolism, and device malfunction continue to be the most serious threats to long-term survival in these patients. Despite that, patients who do well are now able to be discharged from the hospital and resume relatively normal lives with the devices. The article reviews 3 of the most widely used LVADs for bridge to transplant therapy: the Thoratec; HeartMate vented electric; and the Novacor Left Ventricular Assist System. Indications, mechanism of operation, clinical problems, and out-of-hospital preparation are outlined.
