Left Atrial Strain Correlates with Elevated Filling Pressures in Pediatric Heart Transplantation Recipients. Noninvasive assessment of diastolic function in pediatric heart transplantation (PHTx) patients is important for monitoring of rejection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and nonspecific graft failure. We hypothesized that left atrial strain (LAS) would correlate with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and that cutoff values to identify elevated left ventricular (LV) filling pressure could be derived for clinical practice and future testing. This was a secondary analysis of a prospectively collected cohort of PHTx patients undergoing same-day cardiac catheterization with biopsy and transthoracic echo. There were 70 patients with 85 clinical encounters. Traditional mitral inflow Doppler, LAS, LV diastolic strain and strain rate, and ratios for mitral E to LV diastolic strain and strain rate were assessed. Correlation with PCWP was performed, and receiver operator characteristic curves were generated for an elevated mean PCWP, acute rejection, and cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Decreased LAS during the atrial reservoir phase (Ɛres) correlated with higher invasively measured PCWP (r = -0.40, P < .001). An Ɛres cutoff of 14.5% had good discriminatory ability for an elevated PCWP (sensitivity 75%, specificity 82%), and Ɛres > 22.0% had 100% negative predictive value; Ɛres was superior to other measures of diastolic function. Subanalyses for recent acute rejection (n = 9) showed good discriminatory ability for Ɛres of 14.5% (sensitivity 89%, specificity 74%). LAS correlates with invasively measured PCWP and can identify elevated pressures better than traditional and other advanced diastolic function parameters. Use of LAS in PHTx patients may aid in noninvasive monitoring for rejection and nonspecific graft dysfunction.
