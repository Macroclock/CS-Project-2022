Lower risk of infectious deaths in cardiac transplant patients receiving basiliximab versus anti-thymocyte globulin as induction therapy. Conventional antibody induction therapy is currently used in heart transplantation despite safety concerns. This 6-month, prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label study examined whether basiliximab offers a tolerability benefit compared with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) while maintaining similar efficacy in de novo heart transplant recipients. Adult heart transplant recipients were randomized to receive basiliximab (20 mg on Day 0 and Day 4) or ATG (2.5 mg/kg/day for 3 to 5 days) with cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids. The primary safety end-point was a composite of serum sickness, fever, cutaneous rash, anaphylaxis, infection, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and post-transplant proliferative disease. Efficacy was assessed by a composite end-point of death, graft loss, acute rejection Grade > 1B, acute rejection associated with hemodynamic compromise or treated with antibody therapy, or loss to follow-up, whichever occurred first. Eighty patients were randomized and analyzed. By Month 6, the incidence of the composite safety end-point was significantly lower with basiliximab than with ATG (50.0% vs 78.6%, p = 0.01), and infectious death was less frequent in the basiliximab group (0 of 38 vs 6 of 42, p = 0.027). The composite efficacy end-point occurred in 24 patients (63.2%) in the basiliximab arm vs 28 patients (66.7%, p = not significant [NS]) receiving ATG. Acute rejection episodes of Grade > or = 1B were reported with similar frequency (50% with basiliximab vs 45.2% with ATG, p = NS); 7 patients (18.4%) in the basiliximab group and 3 (7.1%) in the ATG group had rejection Grade > or = 3A. These results suggest that basiliximab offers improved tolerability with similar efficacy compared with current polyclonal antibody induction therapy in de novo heart transplant patients.
