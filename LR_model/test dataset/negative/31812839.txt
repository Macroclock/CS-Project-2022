Current evaluation and management of plastic bronchitis in the pediatric population. To describe a multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of plastic bronchitis (PB) in children. Retrospective chart review of children with PB between 1997 and 2017. Data regarding clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, and outcomes were analyzed. Of 34 patients presenting with PB, 24 had single ventricle (SV) heart disease, 9 had pulmonary disease, and one had no underlying disease. Median (IQR: interquartile range) age at the time of PB diagnosis was 5.5 years (IQR: 9.0). Presenting symptoms included cough productive of casts (n = 27, 79%), wheezing (n = 5, 15%), dyspnea (n = 18, 53%), hypoxia (n = 31, 91%), and respiratory failure (n = 9, 26%). Diagnosis was made based on clinical evaluation, bronchoscopy findings, and/or pathology of casts. Treatment methods included bronchoscopy for cast removal (25% of SV patients, 91% of non-SV patients), chest physiotherapy (SV: 92%, non-SV: 45%), albuterol (SV: 79%, non-SV: 73%), inhaled steroids (SV: 75%, non-SV: 18%), nebulized hypertonic saline (SV: 29%, non-SV: 9%), nebulized heparin (SV: 8%, non-SV: 55%), nebulized tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; SV: 33%, non-SV: 9%), inhaled Dornase Alfa (SV: 54%, non-SV: 9%), antibiotics (SV: 46%, non-SV: 45%), systemic steroids (SV: 13%, non-SV: 45%), and lymphatic embolization (SV: 8%, non-SV: 45%). Of SV patients, 11 had no recurrence, 5 underwent heart transplantation, one awaits transplant, and 3 died due to cardiac disease. Three patients with respiratory disease had recurrent PB and one died from MRSA pneumonia. PB is a highly morbid disease with limited treatment options. Bronchoscopy and chest physiotherapy for airway clearance are among the most-utilized therapies. 'Pediatric', 'Plastic bronchitis'
