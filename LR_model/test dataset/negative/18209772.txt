A case of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. The present report describes a 40-year-old woman with a long history of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and left bundle branch block. She was treated with various antiarrhythmic agents; ventricular tachycardia ablation was attempted and an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator was implanted. Three-dimensional echocardiography clearly demonstrated features of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, including marked right ventricular (RV) dilation, decreased RV systolic function and thinning of the RV free wall. Other RV morphological abnormalities included excessive trabeculations and a localized apical aneurysm. Two years later, the patient developed symptoms of congestive heart failure. Despite maximal medical therapy, her clinical condition continued to deteriorate and she was referred for heart transplantation. Results of the pathology of her explanted heart confirmed this rare diagnosis. She presented with an unusual clinical course for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, which was complicated by progressive congestive heart failure and ultimately required heart transplantation. Three-dimensional echocardiography identified the structural abnormalities related to this rare disease.
