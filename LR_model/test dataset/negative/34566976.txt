Oridonin Prolongs the Survival of Mouse Cardiac Allografts by Attenuating the NF-κB/NLRP3 Pathway. Oridonin (Ori), the main bioactive ingredient of the natural anti-inflammatory herb  The cardiac transplantation models were conducted among three groups of mice from C57BL/6NCrSlc (B6/N) or C3H/HeNSlc (C3H) to C3H: the syngeneic and the allogeneic group, whose recipients were treated with vehicle of Ori, and the Ori treatment group, in which the recipients were transplanted hearts from MHC-I mismatched donors and treated with different dosages of Ori from post-operative day (POD) 0 to 7. Then, we investigated the effect of Ori on bone marrow-derived dendritic cell (BMDC) and allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction  Ori with 3, 10, and 15 mg/kg Ori could prolong the survival (MST = 22.8, 49.2, and 65.3 days, respectively). We found that infiltrating CD8 Our findings highlight the potential of Ori as a novel and natural IS agent to improve transplant tolerance. Ori could exert IS activity through decreasing IL-1β and IL-18 production and Th1 differentiation and proliferation and expanding Tregs  'BMDC', 'NF-κB', 'NLRP3 inflammasome', 'Th1 differentiation', 'acute rejection (AR)', 'adaptive immune', 'cardiac transplantation', 'oridonin'
