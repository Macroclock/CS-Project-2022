[Anemization, recurring bouts of fever and cardiac insufficiency in a young woman]. A young woman having undergone surgery for aortic coarctation in childhood developed severe cardiac insufficiency after being ill for a few months. The clinical picture turned out to be compatible with subacute endocarditis. The patient received antibiotic treatment with vague effect on hemodynamics and the aortic valve was replaced.
