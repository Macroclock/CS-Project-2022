Impact of the CYP3A5*1 Allele on the Pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus in Japanese Heart Transplant Patients. Tacrolimus, a major immunosuppressant used after transplantation, is associated with large interindividual variation involving genetic polymorphisms in metabolic processes. A common variant of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 gene, CYP3A5*3, affects blood concentrations of tacrolimus. However, tacrolimus pharmacokinetics at the early stage of transplantation have not been adequately studied in heart transplantation. We retrospectively examined the impact of the CYP3A5 genotype on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics at the early stage of heart transplantation. The tacrolimus pharmacokinetic profile was obtained from 65 patients during the first 5 weeks after heart transplantation. Differences in the patients' characteristics and tacrolimus pharmacokinetic parameters between the CYP3A5 expresser (*1/*1 or *1/*3 genotypes) and non-expresser (*3/*3 genotype) groups were assessed by the Chi-square test, Student's t test, or Mann-Whitney U test. The CYP3A5 *1/*1, *1/*3, and *3/*3 genotypes were detected in 5, 22, and 38 patients, respectively. All patients started clotrimazole therapy approximately 1 week after starting tacrolimus. Apparent clearance and dose/weight to reach the target trough concentration (C Similar concentration-time curves for tacrolimus were obtained in the expresser and non-expresser groups by dose adjustment based on therapeutic drug monitoring. These results demonstrate the importance of the CYP3A5 genotype in tacrolimus dose optimization based on therapeutic drug monitoring after heart transplantation.
