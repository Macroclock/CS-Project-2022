Preliminary experience with conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to everolimus in cardiac transplantation maintenance therapy. Everolimus has been prescribed both for initial and maintenance therapy after cardiac transplantation. Herein, we present our initial experience with everolimus as maintenance therapy after cardiac transplantation. We retrospectively included all of our patients in whom therapy was changed from calcineurin inhibitors to everolimus between September 2006 and October 2007. We analyzed their baseline clinical characteristics, indications for conversion to everolimus therapy, and beneficial vs adverse effects of the maneuver. In 16 heart transplant recipients, therapy was changed to everolimus because of allograft vasculopathy (n = 8), renal failure (n = 4), or sirolimus toxicity (n = 4). Treatment with everolimus was initiated at a mean (SD) of 79.8 (52.7) months (range, 10-163 mo) after transplantation. The initial dose was 1.4 (0.2) mg (range, 1.0-1.5 mg), and the maintenance dose was 1 (0.31) mg (range, 0.5-1.5 mg). Follow-up was 7.28 (3.22) months (range, 0.5-13 mo). Observed side effects included hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, and edema. Only 1 of 4 patients included because of sirolimus intolerance did not tolerate everolimus; renal dysfunction did not worsen in any of these 4 patients. No allograft vasculopathy was observed. Renal function seem to stabilize after conversion to everolimus therapy in patients with previous progressive dysfunction. The safety profile was proved in all patients, although conclusions cannot be established about the evolution of allograft vasculopathy.
