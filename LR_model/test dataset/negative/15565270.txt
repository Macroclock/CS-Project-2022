Hypoplastic left heart syndrome and valvar pulmonary stenosis: presentation and management.

He was successfully palliated with multiple cardiac catheterization interventions while waiting for cardiac transplantation. This unusual constellation of heart defects is an entity that is rare and not well described in the literature.
