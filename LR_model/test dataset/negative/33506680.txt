Noninvasive Radionuclide Molecular Imaging of the CD4-Positive T Lymphocytes in Acute Cardiac Rejection. Heart transplantation (HT) is an effective treatment for end-stage heart disease. However, acute rejection (AR) is still the main cause of death within one year after HT. AR is an acute immune response mediated by T lymphocytes, mainly CD4+ T lymphocytes. This study innovatively develops a radiolabeled probe  'CD4', 'SPECT/CT', 'acute rejection', 'heart transplantation', 'molecular imaging'
