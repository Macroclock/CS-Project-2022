Traveling after heart transplantation. With evolving medical techniques and post-operative care, the quality of life after cardiac transplantation is improving over the recent years. However, the need for continuous immunosuppressive therapy may result in restrictions from some social and recreational activities, including traveling. The aim of this study was to analyze traveling activities and complications in a large cohort of heart transplant recipients, with the intention to develop adequate safety and behavioral guidelines. Using a standardized questionnaire, 103 consecutive patients (pts) were asked to report about time and destination of their traveling activities, predominant activities, as well as potential travel-related complications. Documented rejection episodes as well as laboratory data are listed. Feedback was 97% (of 103 pts asked). Out of 100 pts who responded, [82 males, 18 females, mean age 52.3 +/- 12.4 yr, 6.9 +/- 3.8 yr post-heart transplantation (HTX)] 95 reported on traveling activities (95%). Concomitant disease was present in form of diabetes (n=8), renal insufficiency (n=5) and cardiac allograft vasculopathy (n=12). Mean cumulative traveling time was 120 +/- 125 d (3-560 d). Except from domestic journeys, 79 pts chose destinations within Europe, and 29 to overseas countries. Complications were reported by 15 of 95 pts (15.8%), being mostly small accidents and febrile episodes. Rejection episodes or other life threatening events were not observed. There was no significant correlation between observed complications and gender, age, time post-HTX, immunosuppression or comorbidities. Traveling after HTX appears to be safe and favorably improves quality of life, if certain precautions are met.
