Successful hematopoietic cell transplantation following cardiac transplantation in two pediatric patients. We report two patients who underwent cardiac transplantation at a young age and subsequently required a HCT for varied indications. Despite the challenges associated with HCT following cardiac transplant, including need for altered immunosuppression, toxicities related to chemotherapy exposure, and infection risks, both patients are currently alive and well. There is a paucity of such successful cases documented in the literature, and these cases highlight the critical importance of an experienced, multidisciplinary team when caring for this patient population.
