Treatment of ventricular tachycardia in patients with heart failure. Heart failure is a major public health concern that is frequently complicated by ventricular arrhythmias. Sustained ventricular tachycardia is associated with an increased risk for progressive heart failure and sudden death. We summarize the current management strategies for ventricular tachycardia in heart failure patients, including implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy, pharmacologic therapy, catheter ablation techniques, ventricular assist device therapy, and heart transplantation.
