Psychological assessment of patients undergoing cardiac transplant in a teaching hospital (2004 to 2012). To analyze the psychological evaluations of patients with heart failure waiting for heart transplantation. The data were obtained from patient records containing pre-surgery psychological evaluations performed by psychologists from the multidisciplinary cardiology team. The evaluation protocol included the Quality of Life Questionnaire (SF-36), Beck Depression Inventory, and an interview script. The results of psychological evaluations performed between 2004 and 2012 for 60 candidates for heart transplantation were analyzed: 43 men and 17 women aged between 16 and 66 years (Mean=45.18; SD=11.91), predominantly from the São José do Rio Preto area (São Paulo state, Brazil) (83%), with incomplete elementary education (68%), and who were in stable relationships (73%). Although women presented higher mean scores for depression (21.41) than men (14.61), there was no significant difference between genders. Women's quality of life was impaired in all domains compared to men (below 50%) and was significantly poorer in the physical functioning (P=0.01), vitality (P=0.00), emotional role functioning (P=0.04), and mental health (P=0.02) domains. Patients with psychosocial vulnerability (e.g., depression) identified before transplantation should receive psychological treatment.
