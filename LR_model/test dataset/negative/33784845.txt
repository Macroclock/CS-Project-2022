Impact of gender in patients with continuous-flow left ventricular assist device therapy in end-stage heart failure. There is an ongoing debate about the influence of the female gender on postoperative outcomes after durable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. Despite the differences in pathophysiology of heart failure in females, therapy concepts are the same as in the male population. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the female gender in surgical heart failure therapy. Between August 2010 and January 2020, 207 patients were treated with durable LVAD at out institution. We matched 111 patients in two groups to compare the outcomes in male and female patients and to stratify the risk factors of mortality. The groups were matched 2:1 and were comparable after matching. We found no difference in in-hospital and follow-up mortality between male and female patients. Postoperative adverse events and complications were found to be unvaried across male and female patients. Female patients had higher rates of postoperative LVAD-thrombosis compared to their male counterparts (13.5% vs 0,  Durable continuous flow left ventricular assist devices as a bridge to transplantation or recovery in female patients are associated with a higher risk of acute kidney injury requiring RRT and are at a higher risk of LVAD-thrombosis. Nevertheless, survival rates between genders are similar. 'Gender', 'LVAD', 'MCS', 'female gender', 'heart failure'
