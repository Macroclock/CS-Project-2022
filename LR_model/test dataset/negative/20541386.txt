The role of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase in the induction of immune tolerance in organ transplantation. The aim of this review is to present current information on transplantation research regarding the role of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase in immune regulation. We present the basic mechanisms by which the enzyme is expressed, followed by tryptophan catabolism that leads to midg1 phase arrest and apoptosis. Other effects proposed, although not yet completely proven and generally accepted, include T-cell development suppression, secretion of regulatory cytokines such as IL10, and generation of new T regulatory cells. Clinical studies are being performed worldwide; thus, our goal is to focus on the clinical potential relevance of the enzyme rather than a presentation on a molecular basis so that health care providers concerning transplantation are aware of this promising field in immunology and therapeutics. We do emphasize the fact that information regarding the role of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase in human beings is still scarce.
