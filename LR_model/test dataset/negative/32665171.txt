Berlin Heart EXCOR Support in the First Year of Life: A Single Centre Experience. Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric Ventricular Assist Device (BHE) (Berlin Heart AG, Berlin, Germany, BHE) is used worldwide for mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to transplantation or recovery for children with end-stage heart failure. The study aim was to evaluate morbidity and mortality of children less than one year old supported with BHE to identify predictors of adverse outcomes. Data of all children aged less than one year supported with BHE between 2005 and 2018 at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne were reviewed. Adverse events were defined using PediMACS criteria. Fourteen (14) children under 1 year of age were implanted with BHE at a median age and weight of 0.37 years (IQR 0.09-0.7) and 5.7 kg (IQR 3.5-7.95) respectively. Four (4) patients were neonates, and 10 were older infants. Twelve (12) patients had cardiomyopathy and two, myocarditis. Preoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support was required in six patients for a mean of 9 days (IQR 6-13). Sepsis occurred in five patients (36%) and thromboembolic stroke in two patients (14%). Survival to bridge to transplantation (11) and recovery (1) was achieved in 12 patients (86%). Mortality was 14%. The median duration of BHE support was 110 days (IQR 40-161). Both patients who died were neonates with myocarditis and required surgical re-intervention during BHE support. BHE provides excellent support as a bridge to transplantation or recovery in infants, with a low incidence of neurological dysfunction. Neonates with myocarditis may be at greater risk for death after BHE implantation. 'Berlin Heart EXCOR', 'VAD', 'Ventricular assist device'
