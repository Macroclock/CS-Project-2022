Improvement of apparently fixed pulmonary hypertension with cardiac resynchronization therapy. Many patients with advanced heart failure are ineligible for cardiac transplantation because of fixed pulmonary arterial hypertension. Cardiac resynchronization therapy, by stimulating the right atrium, and right and left ventricles, is a new therapy that effectively palliates symptoms in patients with heart failure. Cardiac resynchronization therapy increases cardiac output and decreases pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, thus partially reversing hemodynamic abnormalities that lead to secondary pulmonary hypertension in many heart failure patients. We describe a patient whose previously fixed pulmonary hypertension improved to the point that she was once again considered eligible for cardiac transplantation.
