The falling incidence of hematologic cancer after heart transplantation. A number of changes in the management of heart transplantation (HT) patients have each tended to reduce the risk of post-HT hematologic cancer, but little information is available concerning the overall effect on incidence in the HT population. Comparison of data from the Spanish Post-Heart-Transplantation Tumour Registry for the periods 1991-2000 and 2001-2010. The incidence among patients who underwent HT in the latter period was about half that observed in the former, with a particularly marked improvement in regard to incidence more than fiveÂ yr post-HT. Changes in HT patient management have jointly reduced the risk of hematologic cancer in the Spanish HT population. Long-term risk appears to have benefited more than short-term risk.
