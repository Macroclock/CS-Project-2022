Aortic valve replacement for late infective endocarditis after heart-lung transplantation. Infective endocarditis is a rare but life-threatening complication of heart and heart-lung transplantation. We describe a 32-year-old woman who developed aortic valvular endocarditis following heart-lung transplantation. Enterococcus was the infective organism. The patient's condition was successfully managed using prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy and aortic valve replacement.
