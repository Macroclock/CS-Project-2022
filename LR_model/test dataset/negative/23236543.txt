Endomyocardial biopsy for monitoring heart transplant patients: 11-years-experience at a german heart center. Heart transplantation (HTX) has become an established therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure. Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) still represents the gold standard for routine surveillance of heart transplant rejection. The objective of this article is to report our experience regarding the use of EMB in monitoring heart transplant recipients. We evaluated retrospectively all patients who underwent orthotopic HTX between 2000 and 2011 at our hospital. From all patients, we created a follow-up, determined the number of EMB events and described the complications associated with this procedure. HTX was performed in 142 cases at our center in the last 11 years (1.3% of the total of 10693 cardiac surgical operations in that period). Further 9 patients visited our department for monitoring after HTX performed at an external center (total: 151). For all patients, a total of 1896 EMB events have been recorded. The majority of biopsies were performed through the right internal jugular vein. The overall complication rate was 1% (n=19). The histological examination of right ventricular EMB still represents the gold standard of care for cardiac allograft rejection monitoring. EMB is an invasive, but safe and dedicated diagnostic procedure. However, the usefulness of recent non-invasive diagnostic approaches as an adjunct tool in monitoring for rejection remains to be further analyzed.
