Complex HeartWare left ventricular assist device infection treated with pump exchange: clinical alert for the driveline location. Infection is a major complication in patients with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Once a driveline exit-site infection (DLI) reaches the LVAD component, LVAD exchange may become necessary for radical treatment, although clinical results are not satisfactory. In this report, we describe two cases of LVAD infection successfully treated with pump exchange. During LVAD support, the DLI extended into the pump pocket and the outflow graft despite aggressive surgical debridement and negative pressure wound therapy. These two patients required LVAD exchange for radical treatment, because the estimated waiting period for heart transplantation was at least more than 1 year. The LVAD exchange was performed through median re-sternotomy, and the infected HeartWare ventricular assist device (HVAD) was completely removed under cardiopulmonary bypass. Then, a new LVAD covered with the omentum flap was implanted. These two patients were successfully bridged to heart transplantation after 10 months and 2 years of support without recurrence of infection. These two cases may suggest that the driveline of the HVAD needs to be kept away from the outflow graft to prevent refractory outflow graft infection. 'Driveline infection', 'HVAD', 'Pump exchange'
