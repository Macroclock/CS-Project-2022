Immune Monitoring of Infectious Complications in Transplant Patients: an Important Step towards Improved Clinical Management. Immune reconstitution following organ transplantation is absolutely critical in preventing infectious complications. However, understanding the kinetics of immune reconstitution and its potential impact on the clinical management of transplant patients remains a significant challenge. Over the last decade, various platform technologies have emerged which have provided important insights into the immune reconstitution kinetics in transplant patients. However, many of these technologies are too complicated and cumbersome to implement in a clinical setting. In this issue of the
