Cardiac recovery in a human non-heart-beating donor after extracorporeal perfusion: source for human heart donation? Successful renal, liver and more recently lung transplantation using organs from non-heart-beating donors (NHBDs) has been reported. Regarding the heart, it has generally been assumed that warm ischemic insult would result in overwhelming and irreversible myocardial damage. We report recovery of cardiac function in a human NHBD by using extracorporeal perfusion 23 minutes after cardiorespiratory arrest. Successful cardiac resuscitation in the NHBD represents a potential source of increased donor organ supply for clinical heart transplantation.
