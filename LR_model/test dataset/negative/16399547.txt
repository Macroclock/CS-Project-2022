Recurrence of iron deposition in the cardiac allograft in a patient with non-HFE hemochromatosis. We report the case of a 36-year-old woman with a diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who underwent cardiac transplantation. The results of her initial iron studies were normal, but hemochromatosis was suspected after microscopy of the explanted heart revealed iron deposition. By 6 months post-transplantation, iron deposition was detected in her surveillance endomyocardial biopsy specimens and studies then confirmed the existence of non-HFE hemochromatosis. The patient has been stable on treatment with regular phlebotomies and a low vitamin C diet.
