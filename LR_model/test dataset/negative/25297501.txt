The successful management of respiratory complications with long-term, low-dose macrolide administration in pediatric heart transplant recipients. We report three pediatric heart transplant (HTx) patients whose respiratory symptoms were successfully controlled with long-term, low-dose macrolide administration (clarithromycin: CAM; approximately 2.5 mg/kg bid). The first case was an 18-year-old boy who underwent HTx at the age of three for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Beginning at age 5, he had repeated fevers and respiratory symptoms. He was diagnosed with chronic sinusitis at age 11 and sinobronchial syndrome with mild bronchiectasis at age 14. Administration of long-term, low-dose CAM and otolaryngeal topical therapy led to significant improvement of his symptoms. The second case was a 7-year-old boy who underwent HTx for DCM at age one. Starting at age 4, he had repeated fevers and cough due to atelectasis and pneumonia. As antibiotics and respiratory physical therapy proved ineffective, he received long-term, low-dose CAM, resulting in successful control of his atelectasis and recurrent pneumonia. The third case was a 13-year-old boy who underwent HTx at age 6 for DCM. He had chronic sinusitis starting at age 7, and was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome at age 10. Adenotonsillectomy and continuous positive airway pressure support therapy were indicated. At age 13, long-term, lowdose CAM administration was started following mycoplasma infection. In all three cases, the levels of calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus) and everolimus were kept in the optimal range with careful drug monitoring. Longterm, low-dose macrolide administration effectively prevents and treats respiratory complications in pediatric HTx patients as long as attention is paid to potential drug interactions.
