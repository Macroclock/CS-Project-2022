Long-term experiences on cardiac retransplantation in adults. It remains disputed whether cardiac retransplantation should be performed. This study aimed to evaluate our long-term experiences on cardiac retransplantation in adults. Between March 1989 and December 2004, 2% (28/1290) of cardiac retransplantations were performed. The reasons for cardiac retransplantation were cardiac allograft vasculopathy (n=13; 47%), primary graft failure (n=11; 39%), and refractory acute rejection (n=4; 14%). The 30-day mortality risk was 29% (acute rejection: 50%; primary graft failure: 36%; cardiac allograft vasculopathy: 15%, p=0.324), compared to 8.5% for primary cardiac transplantation (p<0.001). The causes of early death were acute rejection (n=3; 37%), multiorgan failure (n=3; 37%), primary graft failure (n=1; 13%), and right ventricular failure (n=1; 13%). The late mortality rate was 96/1000 patient-years. The causes of late death were acute rejection (n=4; 50%), cardiac allograft vasculopathy (n=2; 25%), multiorgan failure (n=1; 13%), and infection (n=1; 13%). The 1-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival was respectively 78, 68, 54, and 38% (primary cardiac transplantation), and 46, 41, 32, and 32% (cardiac retransplantation) (p=0.003). The short-term survival for cardiac retransplantation due to cardiac allograft vasculopathy was likely better than primary graft failure and refractory acute rejection (p=0.09). The overall outcomes of cardiac retransplantation are significantly inferior to primary cardiac transplantation. Cardiac retransplantation should be only performed for selected patients.
