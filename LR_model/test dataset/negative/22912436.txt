Endothelial cell antibody-mediated rejection and successful retransplantation in a heart transplanted patient. Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) plays a significant role in cardiac allograft dysfunction, and recently a consensus regarding the diagnosis of AMR has been published. To our knowledge, it has not previously been reported that acute graft failure related to AMR, and antiendothelial cell antibodies can successfully be diagnosed to allow the patient to receive the outlined treatment and undergo a subsequent retransplantation.
