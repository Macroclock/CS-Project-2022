Assessment of biventricular function by three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography in clinically well pediatric heart transplantation patients. The biventricular function plays an important role in the prognosis of pediatric heart transplantation (HTx) patients. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the biventricular function of pediatric HTx patients by three-dimensional (3D) speckle-tracking echocardiography (3D-STE). We enrolled 30 clinically well pediatric HTx patients and 30 healthy controls with a similar distribution of sex and age to the HTx. All participants underwent comprehensive two-dimensional (2D) and 3D echocardiography. Left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS), global circumferential strain (GCS), left and right ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF and RVEF, respectively), and right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain (RV FWLS) were acquired by 3D-STE. Moreover, the correlations between strains and clinical data were explored. Compared with controls, LV GLS was decreased in pediatric HTx patients (P < .05), while LV GCS and LVEF showed no difference. LV GLS showed a weak correlation with cold ischemic time in HTx group (r = 0.396, P < .05). Meanwhile, RVEF and RV FWLS were significantly lower in the HTx group (P < .05). In the HTx group, RV FWLS showed a weak correlation with the preoperative mean pulmonary artery pressure (r = 0.420, P < .05) and postoperative pulmonary artery systolic pressure (r = 0.465, P < .05). The 3D-biventricular mechanical functions were decreased in clinically well pediatric HTx patients. The provided characteristics and appropriate normal values of biventricular mechanical functions can be the basis in subsequent studies in the pediatric HTx patients.
