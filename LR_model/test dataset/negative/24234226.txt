Netrin-1 attenuates cardiac ischemia reperfusion injury and generates alternatively activated macrophages. Ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury is a major issue in cardiac transplantation and inflammatory processes play a major role in myocardial IR injury. Netrin-1 is a laminin-related protein identified as a neuronal guidance cue and netrin-1 expressed outside the nervous system inhibits migration of leukocytes in vitro and in vivo and attenuates inflammation-mediated tissue injury. In our study, hearts of C57BL/6 mice were flushed and stored in cold Bretschneider solution for 8 h and then transplanted into syngeneic recipient. We found that netrin-1 decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages. Troponin T (TnT) production on 24 h after myocardial IR injury was reduced by netrin-1 administration. Cardiac output at 60 mmHg of afterload pressure was significantly increased in hearts with netrin-1 administration (IR + Netrin-1: 59.9 ± 5.78 ml/min; IR: 26.2 ± 4.3 ml/min; P < 0.05). Netrin-1 treatment increased expression of the alternatively activated macrophage (AAM) markers arginase-1 (Arg-1) and mannose receptor (MR) and promoted proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) expression in cardiac allograft. Furthermore, decreased TnT expression and reduced allograft infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages by netrin-1 was abolished with addition of PPARγ antagonist. In conclusion, netrin-1 attenuates cardiac IR injury and generates AAM which contributes to the protective effect of netrin-1.
