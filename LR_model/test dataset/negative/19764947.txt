The pathophysiology of chronic graft failure in the cardiac transplant patient. Following cardiac transplantation, many patients develop chronic deterioration of graft function, which may lead to a clinical syndrome similar to native chronic heart failure (CHF). This condition of chronic cardiac graft failure (CGF) may also share pathophysiological processes comparable with that of CHF. However, the unique environment following cardiac transplantation may also contribute with a variety of unique mechanisms, deserved of special attention. This review article discusses the complex pathophysiology of CGF after cardiac transplantation, an important yet neglected condition of transplant medicine.
