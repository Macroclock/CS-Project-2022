[Cardiac sarcoidosis--a difficult diagnosis. A report of 8 consecutive patients with arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy]. During the period 1984-2005, eight patients aged 25-57 years were treated for cardiac sarcoidosis. Diagnosis was obtained in three patients by endomyocardial biopsy, in three at heart transplantation (HTx) and in two at autopsy. Two patients had heart block, five ventricular arrhythmias and six dilated cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure. Five patients died, one by sudden death, two of heart failure and two after HTx. Diagnosing cardiac sarcoidosis remains difficult, although MRI and PET scan have renewed the awareness of the disease.
