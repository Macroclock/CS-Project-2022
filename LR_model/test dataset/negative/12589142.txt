Nonmelanoma skin cancer in organ transplant patients. Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is more frequent in immunocompromised patients, for example, patients with organ transplants. A number of studies have been published from different countries that present a similar picture of tumors in transplant patients. In addition, the behavior of these tumors is often more aggressive in this group of high-risk patients. The multitude of NMSC and precancerous lesions presents a clinical diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the managing dermatologists. Technology is being developed to cope with the clinical diagnosis and medical adjunct treatment to broaden the therapeutic options. It is suggested that the optimal use of these new developments occurs if patients are seen in specialized clinics aimed at providing preventive measures, diagnosis, and treatment.
