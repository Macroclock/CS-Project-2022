Myocardial tissue remodeling after orthotopic heart transplantation: a pilot cardiac magnetic resonance study. After orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT), the allograft undergoes characteristic alterations in myocardial structure, including hypertrophy, increased ventricular stiffness, ischemia, and inflammation, all of which may decrease overall graft survival. Methods to quantify these phenotypes may clarify the pathophysiology of progressive graft dysfunction post-OHT. We performed cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) with T1 mapping in 26 OHT recipients (mean age 47 ± 7 years, 30 % female, median follow-up post-OHT 6 months) and 30 age-matched healthy volunteers (mean age 50.5 ± 15 years; LVEF 63.5 ± 7 %). OHT recipients had a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF 65.3 ± 11 %) with higher LV mass relative to age-matched healthy volunteers (114 ± 27 vs. 85.8 ± 18 g; p < 0.001). There was no late gadolinium enhancement in either group.
