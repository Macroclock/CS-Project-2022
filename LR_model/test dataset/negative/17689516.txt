Automated monitoring of C2 and C0 blood levels of mycophenolic acid and cyclosporine on the Abbott Architect c8000. Evaluation of the performance of the EMIT 2000 Cyclosporin assay using 2 sets of assay calibrators and the EMIT 2000 mycophenolic acid assay to measure C0 and C2 concentrations on the Abbott Architect c8000 analyzer. Imprecision studies were performed. Cyclosporin concentration was assayed by EMIT on the c8000, by ACMIA on the Dimension and by LC-MS/MS while mycophenolic acid was analyzed by EMIT on c8000 and on Dimension and by HPLC. Agreement between cyclosporin and mycophenolic acid concentrations assayed on the c8000 and on the Dimension was very good. Method comparison between the c8000 and LC-MS/MS resulted in a relative bias of 15.7% for C0 and 11.5% for C2 concentrations. Relative bias of the mycophenolic acid concentrations assayed on the c8000 and the HPLC was 37.7%. When reported properly to the clinician mycophenolic acid and cyclosporine blood levels can be monitored using the EMIT assays on the c8000 consolidating standard routine workflow and reducing reagent costs significantly.
