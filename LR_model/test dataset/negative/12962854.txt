Cardiac donor management: another point of view. The shortage of suitable donor hearts is an important limiting factor in heart transplantation and continues to produce discussion about adequate donor management with regard to graft quality. Recent recommendations, such as limiting the doses of catecholamines for maintenance therapy of cardiac donors, have causes up to two thirds of cardiovascular surgeons to refuse a heart graft from a donor treated with dopamine doses greater than 10 microg/kg/min although endogenous catecholamines may cardiac and pulmonary complications in organ donors, these conditions may be treated using similar agents. Perhaps it is the magnitude of the endogenous catecholamine surge that produces the pathology; thereafter, the levels, may quickly decrease to the point of catecholamine depletion at the receptor level so that exogenous administration is not deleterious and even can have beneficial effects. In the hemodynamic management of organ donors, administration of catecholamines with alpha and beta-1 effects may be needed in sufficient doses to reverse the loss of sympathetic tone at the vascular and cardiac level. Hemodynamic responses display a great individual variability; therefore, a maximal dose should not be set. Catecholamine administration increases coronary artery perfusion pressure, thus optimizing the cardiac performance. Furthermore, it is possible that immunomodulatory effects of catecholamines influence acute allograft rejection rates.
