[Surgical therapy of end-stage heart failure]. Heart failure is still associated with a poor prognosis despite great advances in drug therapy, so that surgical procedures are necessary in patients with end-stage cardiac failure. Cardiac transplantation was the therapy of choice during the last decades, but due to its disadvantages and the increasing scarcity of donor organs other surgical procedures were developed. Multisite pacing improves quality of life, but a longterm survival benefit remains to be proved. Coronary artery bypass grafting and valve surgery demonstrated to improve quality of life and to increase long-term survival. Ventricular assist devices are effective in bridging up to 70% of patients to cardiac transplantation, but the number of complications must be reduced. Partial left ventriculectomy may be performed with results similar to those obtained of cardiac transplantation, but long-term results are not yet available. Dynamic cardiomyoplasty and Myosplint implantation were not successful, but it must be awaited, if passive cardiomyoplasty leads to better results. Xenotransplantation is under intense investigation, but cannot be used clinically until now due to the hurdles of rejection and transfer of infectious diseases. This work provides a summary of today's knowledge about surgical procedures for end-stage heart failure.
