Myelofibrosis on 18F-FDG-PET/CT in a case suspicious for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Recent studies have advocated the utility of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (18)F-FDG-PET imaging in evaluation of various hematological disorders. We report a case of a 61-year-old man with clinical suspicion of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) where (18)F-FDG-PET/CT (computerized tomography) was helpful in identifying myelofibrosis. This paper aims to reveal the potential diagnostic value of PET/CT as an imaging modality in the evaluation of myelofibrosis.
