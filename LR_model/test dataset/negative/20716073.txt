Anesthetic management of children with in situ Berlin Heart EXCOR. Modern mechanical devices can support children with severely impaired cardiac function until a donor heart is found for transplantation or native function recovers. Pediatric heart transplantation offers a good chance of survival with a high quality of life to individuals with limited life expectancy and/or severe limitation to daily activities, but many die on the transplant list or are not listed because of a shortage of donor organs. In recent cohorts, there is better outcome when ventricular assist devices (VADs) rather than extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are used as a 'bridge' to transplantation. Anesthesiologists working in centers where VADs are available may increasingly be asked to provide anesthesia to children with such devices in situ, including procedures outside the cardiac surgical operating room. The Berlin Heart EXCOR device is a VAD system with increasing popularity in pediatric practice and has system components available in sizes suitable even for neonates. Postimplantation considerations include hemodynamics, thromboembolic complications and their prevention by anticoagulation, antimicrobial therapy, and the rehabilitation and mobilization of recipients. VAD-specific emergencies must be recognized and managed appropriately by anesthesiologists looking after Berlin Heart recipients. These include malignant dysrhythmias, sudden loss of VAD output, air or clot embolism, and sudden cyanosis. Provision of anesthesia for patients with an in situ Berlin Heart requires attention to particular considerations in preoperative assessment, induction, maintenance, and postoperative care.
