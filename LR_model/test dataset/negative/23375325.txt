Clinical characteristics of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in heart transplant recipients. We investigated the prevalence and clinical characteristics of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) among heart transplantation patients. Among 86 surviving patients of mean age 43.07 ± 13.23 years including 35 men transplanted from April 1999 to November 2010, 43 (50%) agreed to participate in this study. Patients with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) < 5 were labeled as "normal", with an AHI > 5, as obstructive surgeon (OSA). According to the AHI, subjects were classified as with OSA (group 1; n = 25 of mean age 49.0 ± 12.1 years and including 21 men versus non OSA group 2; n = 18) of mean age 34.8 ± 10.1 years with 14 men. We recorded patient demographic features, medications, polysomnographi observations, laboratory measurements, as well as echocardiographic and angiographic parameters. Prevalence of OSA (AHI > 5) was 58% (n = 25) with 30% (n = 14) as moderate or severe OSA (AHI > 15) OSA patients were significantly older, and showed a greater value of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. Echocardiographic findings revealed the only significant difference to be systolic arterial pressure. The apnea-hypopnea index showed significant correlation with age, BMI, waist circumference, neck circumference, Epworth score, duration of apnea episode, time of SaO(2) under 90% and systolic arterial pressure (SPAP). An inverse correlation was observed between AHI and sleep efficiency, oxygen saturation, and percentage of time in random eye movement (REM) sleep. Multivariate backward logistic regression analysis indicated waist circumference, sleep efficiency, percentage of time in REM sleeps and duration of apnea episode to be independent predictors of AHI. OSA is prevalent among heart transplantation patients. Obesity is a risk factor and waist circumference, and independent predictor for OSA.
