Matrix metalloproteinase suppression induced by clarithromycin in murine cardiac allografts. Although clarithromycin (CAM) has many biological functions, including regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), little is known about its effects on heart transplantation. To clarify the effects of CAM in cardiac rejection, we administered CAM to murine cardiac allograft recipients. CAM suppressed MMP-9 expression in the allografts, resulting in a myocardial inflammatory cell infiltration. Thus, CAM is useful to suppress allograft rejection.
