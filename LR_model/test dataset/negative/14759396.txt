Implications of cardiac resynchronization therapy and prophylactic defibrillator implantation among patients eligible for heart transplantation. This study analyzed the relations and time-related changes in eligibility for cardiac resynchronization therapy and prophylactic defibrillator implantation in 161 potential candidates for heart transplantation. Although up to 62% of patients who fulfilled the severity criteria for heart transplantation were eligible for either device, this percentage increased as clinical/instrumental parameters of heart failure severity worsened.
