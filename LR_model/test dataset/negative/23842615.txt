Use of plasma "reconstitution" during cardio pulmonary bypass for a heart transplant after previous left ventricular assist device implant surgery. The case report describes a novel technique of pre-emptive plasma "reconstitution" prior to disengagement from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to minimize RV volume overload. The concomitant use of hemoconcentration facilitates volume and blood product management in cardiac transplant after previous left ventricular assist device implant surgery.
