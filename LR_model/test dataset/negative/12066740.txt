Transoesophageal echocardiographic monitoring of pulmonary venous obstruction induced by sternotomy closure during infant heart transplantation. A case of an infant receiving orthotopic heart transplantation with over-sized donor heart was reported. Left lower pulmonary venous obstruction after sternotomy closure was detected by transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) and the decision to delay sternal closure was made and the clinical outcome was very satisfactory. The usefulness of intraoperative TOE monitoring and postoperative TOE follow-up for infant heart transplantation, especially in those cases of size mismatch, was well demonstrated.
