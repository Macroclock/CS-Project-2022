Post-transplant ischemic injury is associated with up-regulated AlloMap gene expression. The AlloMap gene expression test is used for the non-invasive detection of rejection. However, the impact of early post-transplant ischemic injury on subsequent AlloMap gene expression analysis has not been evaluated before. Sixty seven heart transplant recipients, mean age 53 years, were evaluated at a mean 34 months post-transplant. AlloMap score was determined on the same day of heart biopsies. Nineteen patients had evidence of early post-transplant ischemic injury (Injury group). These were compared with the remaining 48 patients, Control group. Using multiple regression model with a backward selection method, post-transplant ischemic injury was found to be associated with significant increased AlloMap score compared with controls (31.5 +/- 4.6 vs. 26 +/- 6.2, p < 0.001). The Injury group had increased transplant vasculopathy (KM 5-year freedom from vasculopathy: 34% vs. 52%, p = 0.015), than Controls. Post-transplant ischemic injury is associated with up-regulated AlloMap gene expression, and hence, may provide another explanation for a high score in the absence of rejection.
