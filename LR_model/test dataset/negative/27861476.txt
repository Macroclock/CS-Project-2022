[Combined heart-kidney transplantation in Mexic]. In our country, heart and kidney transplantation is a novel option for treatment of combined terminal heart and kidney failure. This program began in 2012 for selected patients with documented terminal heart failure and structural kidney damage with renal failure. Description of cases: Between January 1, 2012 and April 30, 2016, we made 92 orthotopic heart transplantations. In five of these cases the heart transplantation was combined with kidney transplantation. There were three male and two female patients with a mean age 25.6 Â± 5.2 years (range, 17-29). The patients improved their renal function and the heart transplantation was successful with an improved quality of life. One patient died from abdominal sepsis. The other patients are doing well. The combined heart-kidney transplantation is a safe and efficient procedure for patients with structural kidney and heart damage as a cause of terminal failure.
