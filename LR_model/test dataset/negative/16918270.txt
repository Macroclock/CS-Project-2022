Fontan procedure: old lessons and new frontiers. The Fontan procedure is an operation created for patients with single ventricular physiology. These patients have the potential to survive well into adulthood, however new problems can arise. Various topics, including physiological constraints, patient care, morbidity and clinical outcomes are discussed. The aim of this review is to identify current topics within the care of the Fontan patient population for the physician not comfortable with their unique physiology and complications.
