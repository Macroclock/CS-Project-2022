Impact of weight variation on the metabolic stability of cardiac transplant patients in the state of Ceara. Weight changes frequently occur after cardiac transplantation (CT) and increase the risk of secondary diseases. To determine the impact of weight variation on serum levels of glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides of cardiac transplant patients. Retrospective documentary study conducted with 82 adult patients undergoing CT between October 1997 and December 2005 in the State of Ceara, Brazil. A total of 83% of the patients were male and the mean age was 45.06+/-12.04 years. The variables studied were biopathological profile, weight, and body mass index (BMI) in relation to biochemical and metabolic changes. Data were described using frequencies, measures of central tendency, Student's t test and Pearson's correlation coefficient. The mean overall BMI increased from 23.77+/-3.68 kg/m2 prior to CT, to 25.48+/-3.92 kg/m2 in the first year and to 28.38+/-4.97 kg/m2 in the fifth. Overweight/obese patients (BMI > or = 25 kg/m2) showed mean values of glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides higher than those of normal-weight/underweight patients (BMI < 25 kg/m2). There was a significant direct relation between nutritional state and weight variability on the metabolic profile of cardiac transplant patients.
