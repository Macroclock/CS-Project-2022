Psychosocial and sexual concerns of patients with implantable left ventricular assist devices: a pilot study. We sought to determine the psychosocial and sexual concerns of patients discharged from the hospital with implantable left ventricular assist devices. Bridge-to-transplant patients with the Heartmate left ventricular assist device received a psychosocial and sexual survey at 1 month after discharge from the hospital. The survey consisted of 3 parts, with 5 questions in each category. The patients were asked to complete the survey by circling the responses and to provide more detailed answers when necessary. There were 8 male patients who completed the questionnaire. Psychologically, all patients expressed a positive mood and found support from family or religious sources. The majority described a change in attitude and behavior. Socially, all patients described a change in lifestyle, as well as a change in the reaction of family and friends. No patient went back to work or had the desire to return to work until after transplantation. The minority of patients admitted to smoking or drinking. Sexually, the majority had the desire or participated in sexual activities. The majority of patients either used or were interested in using sexual stimulants. There were no mechanical problems with the left ventricular assist devices. Psychosocial and sexual conditions are altered in patients with heart failure who are discharged with implantable left ventricular assist devices. At 1 month's time interval, there is an improvement in mood, an adjustment in lifestyle, and a positive shift in relations with family and friends. There is sexual desire, with interest in sexual-enhancing medication. The most common concern is related to the pump, such as the durability of the device or damage to the components.
