Replacement of infected aortic prosthetic graft with aortic homograft after heart transplantation: 13-year follow-up. Acute ascending aortic dissection (AAAD) is a rare complication after orthotopic heart transplantation. We report a patient with AAAD after heart transplantation in whom repair was complicated by infection of the ascending aortic prosthetic graft. This was successfully managed by re-do replacement with two cryopreserved aortic homografts. Despite extensive calcification in the wall, the homografts show no aneurysm or dilation after 10 years.
