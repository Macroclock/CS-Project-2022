[Appointment with nurses for transplanted heart clients--impact of educative health actions]. The study was aimed at evaluating the impact of educative health actions on nursing appointments with 18 transplanted heart clients, based on Orem's Theory. It was conducted in a Heart Transplant and Insufficiency Unit of a Public Health Institution in Fortaleza-CE. The data were collected by way of nursing appointments. 14 nursing diagnoses were identified in the first appointment and 7 in the last one. It was found out that the clients developed self-care skills with the implementation of educative health actions, tuming them into self-care agents, reaching a good level of health and well-being. On the other hand, it raised nurses' awareness of a systematic and efficacious management of the clinical monitoring of their clientele.
