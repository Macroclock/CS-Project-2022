Donor or recipient hepatitis B seropositivity is associated with allograft vasculopathy. Increasing interest has focused on possible viral triggers of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Although much interest has centered on cytomegalovirus, it has recently been noted that donor hepatitis C seropositivity is associated with risk for accelerated vasculopathy. The current study hypothesized that hepatitis B (HBV) might be associated with accelerated vasculopathy. Sixty-six patients who received heart transplants between September 1998 and July 2000 were analyzed by intravascular ultrasound within 6 weeks and again at 12 months after transplantation. These patients were divided into 2 groups: the HBV Group (n = 13) in which either the donor or recipient was seropositive for hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), and a Control Group (n = 53) in which neither donor nor recipient was positive for HBcAb. Baseline characteristics of the 2 groups were similar. The HBV Group had significant increase in the change in average intimal area (1.59 +/- 1.4 vs 0.46 +/- 0.4 mm2, p = 0.01) per mm length of the vessel compared with controls. Allograft vasculopathy at 1 year (defined as largest maximal intimal thickness increase of > or =0.50 mm) occurred in 46% of the HBV group compared with 24% of the control group (p = 0.05). When measured as an average maximal intimal thickness increase of >0.30 mm, allograft vasculopathy at 1 year occurred in 31% of the HBV Group compared with 5% of Controls (p = 0.01). These preliminary results suggest that HBV seropositivity in donor or recipient may be associated with an increased risk for cardiac allograft vasculopathy.
