Pantoea agglomerans pneumonia in a heart-lung transplant recipient: case report and a review of an emerging pathogen in immunocompromised hosts. Pantoea agglomerans is a gram-negative rod that is frequently found on the exterior of many plants, fruits, vegetables, and in soil, and it is used as a biopesticide in the agriculture industry. Recent reports have implicated P. agglomerans in systemic infections of immunocompromised hosts and neonates, as well as more localized infections in healthy hosts. P. agglomerans as a cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia has not been well characterized. We report a case of P. agglomerans pneumonia in a heart-lung transplant recipient following transplantation. The organism was susceptible to multiple antimicrobial agents and treated successfully with ertapenem. We review the patient's course and the relevant literature, and discuss implications for the future.
