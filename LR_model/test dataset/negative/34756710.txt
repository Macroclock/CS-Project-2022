Endocrine Management and Hormone Replacement Therapy in Cardiac Donor Management: A Retrospective Observational Study. Pituitary dysfunction after brainstem death can cause various hormone deficiencies in potential heart donors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between hormone replacement therapy (HRT; including antidiuretic hormone analog, thyroid hormone, and methylprednisolone) in heart donors and the recipients' outcomes after heart transplantation (HTx). We retrospectively analyzed HTxs performed between January 2012 and October 2018. Donor and recipient characteristics were retrieved with a focus on endocrine parameters and HRT. The primary outcome was primary graft dysfunction (PGD). Secondary outcomes were the 30-day and 2-year mortality of the recipients. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were applied. The study included 297 HTxs. PGD occurred in 56 recipients (18.9%). In the multivariable Cox analysis, methylprednisolone and thyroxine treatment in donors were associated with a lower odds for PGD (odds ratio [OR], 0.43; 95% CI, 0.19-1.01; P = .052; and OR,: 0.34; 95% CI, 0.15-0.76; P = .009, respectively). In multivariate analysis, thyroxine treatment in donors was associated with a lower odds of PGD (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.86; P = .020). Donor thyroxine supplementation also had a beneficial effect on recipients' 2-year survival (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.96; P = .036). Combined thyroxine and methylprednisolone treatment could be a protective factor against PGD. Thyroxine administration was associated with better 2-year survival in recipients.
