A modified technique for orthotopic heart transplantation to minimize warm ischaemic time. Prolonged allograft ischaemic time in heart transplantation adversely impacts the performance of the donor heart in the immediate postoperative period and ultimately results in decreased post-transplant survival. Therefore, optimal surgical technique for heart transplantation should aim to minimize allograft ischaemic time. Here, we report a case of successful orthotopic heart transplantation using a modified technique to reduce allograft ischaemic time and warm ischaemic time.
