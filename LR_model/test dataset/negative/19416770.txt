Diastolic dysfunction of the cardiac allograft and maximal exercise capacity. Peak oxygen uptake (peak Vo(2)) is an established integrative measurement of maximal exercise capacity in cardiovascular disease. After heart transplantation (HTx) peak Vo(2) remains reduced despite normal systolic left ventricular function, which highlights the relevance of diastolic function. In this study we aim to characterize the predictive significance of cardiac allograft diastolic function for peak Vo(2). Peak Vo(2) was measured using a ramp protocol on a bicycle ergometer. Left ventricular (LV) diastolic function was assessed with tissue Doppler imaging sizing the velocity of the early (Ea) and late (Aa) apical movement of the mitral annulus, and conventional Doppler measuring early (E) and late (A) diastolic transmitral flow propagation. Correlation coefficients were calculated and linear regression models fitted. The post-transplant time interval of the 39 HTxs ranged from 0.4 to 20.1 years. The mean age of the recipients was 55 +/- 14 years and body mass index (BMI) was 25.4 +/- 3.9 kg/m(2). Mean LV ejection fraction was 62 +/- 4%, mean LV mass index 108 +/- 22 g/m(2) and mean peak Vo(2) 20.1 +/- 6.3 ml/kg/min. Peak Vo(2) was reduced in patients with more severe diastolic dysfunction (pseudonormal or restrictive transmitral inflow pattern), or when E/Ea was > or =10. Peak Vo(2) correlated with recipient age (r = -0.643, p < 0.001), peak heart rate (r = 0.616, p < 0.001) and BMI (r = -0.417, p = 0.008). Of all echocardiographic measurements, Ea (r = 0.561, p < 0.001) and Ea/Aa (r = 0.495, p = 0.002) correlated best. Multivariate analysis identified age, heart rate, BMI and Ea/Aa as independent predictors of peak Vo(2). Diastolic dysfunction is relevant for the limitation of maximal exercise capacity after HTx.
