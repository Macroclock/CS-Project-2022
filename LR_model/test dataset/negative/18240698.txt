Community-based weight management in long-term heart transplant recipients: a pilot study. Heart transplant recipients often suffer from obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension thought to be related to triple-drug immunosuppression and poor adherence to diet and exercise. A lifestyle intervention that allows recipients to attend a community-based weight management program may improve health outcomes. To determine (1) the effects of attending a community-based weight management program on weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and the lipid profile; and (2) the feasibility of a community-based program for weight management. Twenty-one patients (81% male; age 57 years, 99.7 months since transplantation) participated in a randomized clinical trial and received either weight management counseling (control) or a 6-month scholarship to a structured commercial program (treatment). Using simple analysis of covariance models, group differences were assessed and reported as marginal means. At baseline, there were no demographic differences between groups. There were no differences in outcome variables except weight (control, 102.1 kg vs treatment, 98.3 kg; P= .05). After 6 months, significant differences were found in weight (control, 100.5 kg vs treatment, 95.6 kg; P= .047) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (control, 40.6 mg/dL vs treatment, 49.1 mg/dL; P= .044). A marginally significant difference was found in systolic blood pressure (control, 138 mm Hg vs treatment, 121 mm Hg; P= .07). A decrease in diastolic blood pressure (6 mm Hg) was attributed to treatment effect (P = .16). No differences were noted in total cholesterol, triglycerides, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The structured commercial program appears to be an effective, feasible alternative to usual care. Findings need to be confirmed in future research with a larger sample.
