Renal Function Changes Under Everolimus Plus Cyclosporine or Everolimus Plus Tacrolimus After Heart Transplantation. Everolimus (EVR) can be used with calcineurin inhibitors to reduce the risk of renal dysfunction, with similar immunosuppressive effect. In this study, we compared renal function after heart transplantation (HT) under EVR with cyclosporine (CSA) or tacrolimus (TAC). Between 2004 and 2014, EVR with CSA or TAC was used in 117 HT at the National Taiwan University Hospital. After HT, all patients received corticosteroid, EVR (C0 target 3-8 ng/mL) and CSA (C0 blood level 100-200 ng/mL), or TAC (Co blood level 5-10 ng/mL). Renal function was evaluated before HT, every month after HT for up to 1 year, and then every 3 months for up to 2 years. Blood-drug levels of EVR, CSA, and TAC were also monitored simultaneously with renal function. The estimated mean glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 76.5 mL/min/1.73 m
