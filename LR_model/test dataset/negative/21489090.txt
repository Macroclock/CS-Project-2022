Immunogenicity of a combined schedule of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine followed by a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine in adult recipients of heart or lung transplants. A combined schedule of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) followed by 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) was evaluated retrospectively in 26 adult recipients of heart or lung transplants. PCV7 was immunogenic in these patients but there appeared to be no benefit from the additional PPV23 dose.
