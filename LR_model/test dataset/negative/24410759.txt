High-mobility group box 1 accelerates early acute allograft rejection via enhancing IL-17+ γδ T-cell response. Th17 and γδ T cells are the dominant IL-17-producing cell. We previously reported that high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is critical in inducing IL-17-producing alloreactive T cells during early stage of acute allograft rejection. However, the role of γδ T cells during this process and its implication in HMGB1-mediated allograft rejection are not fully understood. Here, we use a murine model of cardiac allograft transplantation to further study the role of HMGB1 and IL-17-producing γδ T cells in acute allograft rejection. It was found that the expression of HMGB1 was increased in allograft, while blockade of HMGB1 suppressed IL-17(+) γδ T-cell response and inhibited the gene transcription of IL-23 and IL-1β. Furthermore, in vitro HMGB1 indirectly promoted the development of IL-17(+) γδ T cells by stimulating dendritic cells to produce IL-23 and IL-1β, meanwhile depletion of γδ T cells in vivo prolonged allograft survival and reduced the level of IL-17 in serum. In conclusion, our findings inferred that increased HMGB1 expression could enhance IL-17(+) γδ T-cell response by promoting the secretion of IL-23 and IL-1β, while IL-17(+) γδ T cells contribute to the early stage of acute allograft rejection.
