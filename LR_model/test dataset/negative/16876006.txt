Postmortem intracranial neuropathology in children following cardiac transplantation. At Loma Linda University Children's Hospital, the medical information of 405 pediatric patients who received orthotopic cardiac transplantation were reviewed. Of those who died (n=136), 86% (n=117) underwent postmortem examinations, and the brain was examined in 61% (n=82, male=39). The number and type of intracranial lesions present were compiled, and these were matched to underlying functional cardiac disease categories. Intracranial abnormalities were present in 87%. Infarct was the most common primary central nervous system pathology in hypoplastic left heart syndrome (41%) but was also observed frequently in children with obstructive lesions (37%), cyanotic disease (31%), or cardiac shunting (29%). Secondary findings included extraparenchymal hemorrhage in obstructive lesions (31%); hypoxic changes occurred in 15% of patients with cyanotic disease and in 14% of those with cardiac shunting. Thirty-three percent of children with restrictive lesions had no neuropathology reported. Postmortem examination brain weights were matched against age and sex norms, with 29% of females and 36% of males below two standard deviations. These findings revealed that intracranial pathology was present in the majority of transplanted children who underwent postmortem examination, and that infarctive changes constituted the most common neuropathologic abnormality. Additionally, a number of children had significantly reduced brain weight.
