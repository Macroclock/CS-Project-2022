Fatal cardiac and renal allograft rejection with lenalidomide therapy for light-chain amyloidosis. We describe a patient who underwent a successful heart and kidney transplant for light-chain amyloidosis. She had an excellent hematologic response to bortezomib/dexamethasone therapy. Follow-up therapy with lenalidomide was started, and the patient quickly had a fatal allograft rejection of the heart and kidney. We present evidence to support the theory that lenalidomide, a known immunomodulator, may have stimulated the immune system and precipitated the fatal rejection episode.
