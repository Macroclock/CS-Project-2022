Sensitization during short-term mechanical circulatory support. Determinants, therapeutic management, and outcomes after heart transplant. The development of human-leukocyte antigen antibodies is a well-known adverse effect of the use of long-term ventricular assist devices (VADs). The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of sensitization during short-term mechanical circulatory support with VAD (CentriMag), its determinants, and its impact on posttransplant outcomes. We performed a retrospective review of patients who were bridged to transplant with short-term VAD from 2009 to 2019. Sensitization was defined as a calculated panel-reactive antibody> 10%. The endpoints included overall survival and rejection-free survival. A total of 89 patients (median age 56.0 [interquartile range, 50.0-59.9] years, 16.8% female) received a short-term VAD as a bridge to transplant. The median duration of support was 23.6 [interquartile range, 16.6-35.0] days. Eleven patients (12.4%) became sensitized during support. The only factor significantly associated with sensitization was female sex (OR, 8.67; 95%CI, 1.93-38.8; P=.005). Of the 89 patients, 21 patients died during support; 68 patients underwent heart transplant. After a mean follow-up of 49.6 ±31.2 months, 8 patients (11.8%) died and 20 (29.4%) had at least 1 rejection episode. On multivariate analysis, sensitization was an independent predictor of acute rejection (HR, 3.64; 95%CI, 1.42-9.33; P=.007), with a nonstatistically significant trend to higher mortality (HR, 4.07; 95%CI, 0.96-17.3; P=.057). Sensitization with short-term VADs can occur and is significantly associated with female sex and with rejection. Sensitization also showed a nonstatistically significant trend to higher mortality.
