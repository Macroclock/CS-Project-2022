Heart rate and early progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy: A prospective study using highly automated 3-D optical coherence tomography analysis. Heart rate slowing agents are frequently prescribed to manage heart transplant (HTx) patients with the assumption that higher heart rate is a risk factor in cardiovascular disease. This prospective two-center study investigated early progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) in 116 HTx patients. Examinations by coronary optical coherence tomography and 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring were performed both at baseline (1 month after HTx) and during follow-up (12 months after HTx). During the first post-HTx year, we observed a significant reduction in the mean coronary luminal area from 9.0 ± 2.5 to 8.0 ± 2.4 mm Our study did not confirm a direct association between mean heart rate and progression of CAV. The role of beta blockers warrants further investigation, with our results indicating that they may play a protective role in early CAV development.
