Long-Term Effects of the Replacement of Calcineurin Inhibitors With Everolimus and Mycophenolate in Patients With Calcineurin Inhibitor-Related Nephrotoxicity. There is little evidence on the long-term effects of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) withdrawal and substitution with everolimus and mycophenolate mofetil in maintenance therapy of patients who have received heart transplants and have concurrent CNI nephrotoxicity. Aims of this study were to evaluate the progression of renal dysfunction after discontinuation of CNIs and to monitor for major adverse events after therapy change. Data from 41 patients who underwent heart transplant and have different degrees of renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]Â <60 mL/min/1.73 m In 52% of patients, there was a clear improvement in renal function (10.5 mL/min/1.73 m A therapeutic switch from CNIs to everolimus and mycophenolate mofetil can improve renal function in patients with CNI nephrotoxicity, especially in those with a shorter time period from transplantation, without exposing them to a higher incidence of late acute rejection and cardiac allograft vasculopathy.
