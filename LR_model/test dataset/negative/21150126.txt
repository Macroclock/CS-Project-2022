Mechanical circulatory assistance. Although heart transplantation is the gold standard for the treatment of advanced stage heart failure, the implantation of mechanical circulatory support devices (MCSDs) has become a well-established therapy for this disease. As the population of patients with severe heart failure has grown, the utilization of MCSDs has increased considerably. That trend is expected to continue, especially in light of dramatic advances in MCSD technology. This review outlines the current status and future directions of mechanical circulatory support therapy in the setting of a constantly evolving field of supportive devices and adjuvant therapies.
