Tanshinol suppresses cardiac allograft rejection in a murine model. Achieving long-term cardiac allograft survival without continuous immunosuppression is highly desired in organ transplantation. Studies have shown that Salvia miltiorrhiza, an herb also known as danshen, improves microcirculation and is highly effective in treating coronary heart disease. Our objective is to determine whether tanshinol, an ingredient of danshen, improves cardiac allograft survival. Fully vascularized heterotopic heart transplantation was performed using BALB/c mice as donors and C57BL/6 mice as recipients, which were then treated with tanshinol and rapamycin. CD4 We found that tanshinol significantly delayed cardiac allograft rejection. It promoted long-term allograft survival induced by rapamycin, a mammalian target-of-rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor.
