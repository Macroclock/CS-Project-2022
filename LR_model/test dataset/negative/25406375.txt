Treadmill exercise induces murine cardiac allograft survival and generates regulatory T cell. Exercise therapy has been associated with improvement in functional capacity and quality of life. The role of exercise therapy in heart transplant recipients is of great interest for the transplant society, although concerning the effect of exercise therapy, there is little knowledge at present. We analyzed the effects of exercise on alloimmune responses in murine cardiac allograft transplantation. CBA mice (H2(k) ) underwent transplantation of C57Bl/6 (H2(b) ) hearts and exercised on a treadmill. Untreated CBA recipients rejected C57Bl/6 cardiac grafts acutely (median survival time [MST], 7 days). CBA recipients treated with treadmill for 1 week after transplantation, and for 1 week both before and after transplantation prolonged allograft survivals (MSTs, 35 and 18 days, respectively). However, treadmill exercise recipients for 1 week before transplantation were not effective to allograft survival (MST, 8 days). Adoptive transfer of whole splenocytes and CD4(+) cells from treadmill exercise recipients significantly prolonged allograft survival in naive secondary recipients (MSTs, 30 and 52 days, respectively), suggesting that regulatory cells was generated after treadmill exercise. Moreover, flow cytometry studies showed that CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) cell population increased in treadmill exercise recipients. Therefore, postoperative but not pre-operative exercise could induce prolongation of survival of fully allogeneic cardiac allografts and generate CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells.
