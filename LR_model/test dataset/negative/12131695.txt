Peritransplant streptavidin recipient treatment prolongs rat cardiac allograft survival. Because streptavidin shows high localization in inflamed tissues, it might also interfere with the proliferation of cells involved in allograft rejection. Treatment of naÃ¯ve ACI recipients with 20 mg/kg streptavidin i.p. alone significantly prolonged Lewis cardiac allografts from a mean survival time of 9.8+/-0.7 days in controls to 19.8+/-6.5 days, with one recipient accepting the graft permanently (>250 days). Peritransplant streptavidin treatment combined with 0.5 ml of antilymphocyte serum (ALS) transient immunosuppression led to permanent graft survival (>250 days) in 6 of 10 recipients. Second-set skin grafts performed 60 days after the primary cardiac allograft were prolonged to 45 days, whereas the third party Wistar-Furth (WF) skin grafts were rejected in 15 days without the rejection of the primary Lewis cardiac allografts. Pathology of transplanted cardiac allografts at 100 days showed no mononuclear cell infiltration or chronic allograft vasculopathy. Streptavidin given for 5 days at 20 mg/kg caused a moderate initial weight loss but had no effect on hematologic, biochemical, and histologic parameters in the treated recipients. This study demonstrates that peritransplant recipient treatment with streptavidin combined with peritransplant ALS induces prolonged cardiac and second-set skin allograft survival. We conclude that recipient peritransplant streptavidin treatment may provide a new strategy for the induction of transplant tolerance.
