Long-term surveillance biopsy: Is it necessary after pediatric heart transplant? Due to limited and conflicting data in pediatric patients, long-term routine surveillance endomyocardial biopsy (RSB) in pediatric heart transplant (HT) remains controversial. We sought to characterize the rate of positive RSB and determine factors associated with RSB-detected rejection. Records of patients transplanted at a single institution from 1995 to 2015 with >2 year of post-HT biopsy data were reviewed for RSB-detected rejections occurring >2 year post-HT. We illustrated the trajectory of significant rejections (ISHLT Grade ≥3A/2R) among total RSB performed over time and used multivariable logistic regression to model the association between time and risk of rejection. We estimated Kaplan-Meier freedom from rejection rates by patient characteristics and used the log-rank test to assess differences in rejection probabilities. We identified the best-fitting Cox proportional hazards regression model. In 140 patients, 86% did not have any episodes of significant RSB-detected rejection >2 year post-HT. The overall empirical rate of RSB-detected rejection >2 year post-HT was 2.9/100 patient-years. The percentage of rejection among 815 RSB was 2.6% and remained stable over time. Years since transplant remained unassociated with rejection risk after adjusting for patient characteristics (OR = 0.98; 95% CI 0.78-1.23; P = 0.86). Older age at HT was the only factor that remained significantly associated with risk of RSB-detected rejection under multivariable Cox analysis (P = 0.008). Most pediatric patients did not have RSB-detected rejection beyond 2 years post-HT, and the majority of those who did were older at time of HT. Indiscriminate long-term RSB in pediatric heart transplant should be reconsidered given the low rate of detected rejection. 'biopsy', 'heart transplantation', 'pediatrics', 'rejection'
