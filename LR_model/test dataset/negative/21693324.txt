Mycotic pseudoaneurysm of the ascending aorta after heart transplantation: case report. Mycotic pseudoaneurysm of the ascending aorta is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication after orthotopic heart transplantation. We present a case of a 53-year-old man who developed a mycotic pseudoaneurysm of the ascending aorta after orthotopic heart transplantation. The pseudoaneurysm was surgically resected and the ascending aorta was replaced with allograft. The Gram stain and multiple cultures of the pseudoaneurysm wall revealed that the causative microorganism was coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report that describes mycotic pseudoaneurysm owing to coagulase-negative Staphylococcus infection after heart transplantation. Although S aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are common pathogens in previously published literatures describing mycotic pseudoaneurysms in heart transplant recipients, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus is aslo an important and virulent pathogen that can cause mycotic aortic pseudoaneurysm in immunosuppressed patients. Once diagnosed, aggressive surgical treatment with prudent operative strategy, appropriate postoperative antibiotic therapy and close follow-up by radiographic study are mandatory in managing patients with this potentially fatal condition.
