Endovascular treatment of stroke in children under 2 years with heart failure and ventricular assist device. Strokes in children are characterised by a high mortality rate while, at the same time, the low number of cases makes it difficult to gain practical experience. As heart disease is the most common risk factor, and as more and more cardiological interventions are being carried out, an increase in the incidence of paediatric stroke is expected. In some cases a transplant is required. While waiting for a donor, the use of ventricular assist devices may be necessary. These present with a high rate of neurological complications. We present two cases of children under 2 years of age awaiting heart transplantation supported by ventricular assist devices who had a stroke which was treated by endovascular techniques.  As a result of the difficulty in performing arterial puncture, the small vessel calibre and the limitation in the use of iodated contrast, there are certain limitations to endovascular treatment of strokes in children that can lead to complications. A multidisciplinary approach to managing such cases would be helpful. 'Paediatric stroke', 'endovascular treatment', 'ventricular assist device'
