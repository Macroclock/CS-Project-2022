Non-heme iron protein: a potential target of nitric oxide in acute cardiac allograft rejection. We examined iron nitrosylation of non-heme protein and enzymatic activity of the Fe-S cluster protein, aconitase, in acute cardiac allograft rejection. Heterotopic transplantation of donor hearts was performed in histocompatibility matched (isografts: Lewis --> Lewis) and mismatched (allografts: Wistar-Furth --> Lewis) rats. On postoperative days (POD) 4-6, Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) protein in allografts but not isografts. EPR spectroscopy revealed background signals at g = 2.003 (for semiquinone) and g = 2.02 and g = 1.94 (for Fe-S cluster protein) in isografts and normal hearts. In contrast, in allografts on POD4, a new axial signal at g = 2.04 and g = 2.02 appeared that was attributed to the dinitrosyl-iron complex formed by nitrosylation of non-heme protein. Appearance of this signal occurred at or before significant nitrosylation of heme protein. Iron nitrosylation of non-heme protein was coincidental with decreases in the nonnitrosylated Fe-S cluster signal at g = 1.94. Aconitase enzyme activity was decreased to approximately 50% of that observed in isograft controls by POD4. Treatment with cyclosporine blocked the (i) elevation of plasma nitrate + nitrite, (ii) up-regulation of iNOS protein, (iii) decrease in Fe-S cluster EPR signal, (iv) formation of dinitrosyl-iron complexes, and (v) loss of aconitase enzyme activity. Formation of dinitrosyl-iron complexes and loss of aconitase activity within allografts also was inhibited by treatment of recipients with a selective iNOS inhibitor, l-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl)lysine. This report shows targeting of an important non-heme Fe-S cluster protein in acute solid organ transplant rejection.
