Depression and anxiety levels of the mothers of children and adolescents with left ventricular assist devices. VADs have been used to provide treatment for end-stage heart failure. Parents may feel overwhelmed with the VAD regimes responsibility and be affected from this process beside children. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the depressive and anxiety symptoms of mothers of the first eight children equipped with a VAD in Turkey. The mothers of eight pediatric patients living with VADs were filled BDI and STAI at first month of VAD implantation (E.I) and secondly six months after their first evaluation (E.II). In E.I, the BDI mean score of mothers was 20.87, in E.II 14.37. STAI-S mean score was 53.37 in E.I and 43.62 in E.II. The Wilcoxon nonparametric-paired t-test revealed significant difference between baseline and end-point STAI-S scores (Z: -2.035; p: 0.042), and for BDI scores (Z, -1.965; p, 0.049). Prolonged usage of VAD may increase distress in parents. Psychiatric evaluation and support of the primary caregiver is important for the well-being of the pediatric patients.
