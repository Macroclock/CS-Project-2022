Successful Use of Intragastric Balloon Therapy as a Bridge to Heart Transplantation. Obesity is an important limiting factor for heart transplantation (HT) in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Achieving substantial weight loss is challenging in this population due to activity limitations and fluid retention. Endoscopic bariatric therapies (EBTs) including intragastric balloons (IGB) are effective primary weight loss therapies. IGBs have also been successfully utilized as a bridge therapy prior to liver transplantation and, in one case report, prior to HT. Potential advantages of IGBs in this population include low bleeding risk and less invasiveness as compared to other EBTs and surgery. We report the successful use of IGB as a bridge therapy in two patients with class II obesity and end-stage CHF requiring left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), anticoagulation, antiplatelet, and inotrope therapy.
