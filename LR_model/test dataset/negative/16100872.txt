Endomyocardial biopsy for non-transplant-related disorders. Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) remains the "gold standard" for diagnosing rejection after cardiac transplantation. In addition, it has value in monitoring patients during treatment with doxorubicin. It also is important in the setting of acute-onset heart failure for the diagnosis of myocarditis, particularly giant cell myocarditis because earlier transplantation usually is undertaken in patients with giant cell morphologic features. EMB has a role in the unexplained cardiomyoapthy for excluding specific disease processes that might lead to similar morphofunctional changes but might be reversible or a contraindication for transplantation. This review focuses on the growing number of diseases that can be diagnosed by EMB in adult and pediatric age groups.
