Use of Remote Pulmonary Artery Pressure Monitoring (CardioMEMS System) in Total Artificial Heart to Assess Pulmonary Hemodynamics for Heart Transplantation. The temporary total artificial heart (TAH-t) has been valuable as a bridge to transplantation in patients with biventricular failure. However, the challenges of accurately assessing pulmonary vascular resistance after TAH-t implantation can preclude these patients from heart transplantation, especially those with pre-existing pulmonary hypertension. The CardioMEMS Heart Failure System (St. Jude's Medical, Little Canada, MN) comprises a wireless pressure sensor that is implanted percutaneously in the pulmonary artery and transmits real-time measurements of pulmonary artery pressures. Systolic and diastolic pulmonary artery (PA) pressures measurements have been well correlated between the CardioMEMS PA Sensor and traditional Swan-Ganz catheter and between the CardioMEMS PA Sensor and standard echocardiography. Here, we report the use of the CardioMEMS device in a patient with severe pulmonary hypertension supported with a SynCardia TAH-t (Tucson, AZ) during assessment for candidacy for transplantation.
