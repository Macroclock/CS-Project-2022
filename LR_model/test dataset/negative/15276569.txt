Role of statin therapy in the coronary bypass patient. Statins have been proven to prevent or delay ischemic events in patients at risk for atherosclerotic coronary disease. Increasing evidence suggests that statin therapy is also beneficial to patients undergoing coronary revascularization. In this review statin therapy will be shown to improve vein graft patency, minimize recurrent ischemic events, and decrease the need for repeat revascularization procedures in patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting.
