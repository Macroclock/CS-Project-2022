A medical epopee: recurrent fungal endocarditis, heart transplantation and chylopericardium. Candida prosthetic endocarditis is associated with high mortality rates and valve replacement surgery, together with antifungal treatment, play a major role in eradicating the fungal infection. Valve reoperations in these scenarios may be relatively common due to the high infection relapse rates and, in some cases, heart transplantation may be an imposing therapy for infection resolution and for the heart failure related to the myocardial reoperation injury. Among the many postoperative complications related to heart transplantation, chylopericardium is a rare but challenging example. We report the case of a 55-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital with a 1-month history of progressive dyspnea and fatigue. His past medical history included four open-heart surgeries for aortic and mitral valve replacement due to recurrent Candida parapsilosis infective endocarditis. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a markedly reduced left ventricular systolic function and normofunctioning bioprosthetic valves. An inotropic dependency condition led to heart transplantation surgery. In the early postoperative period, a persistent chylous fluid started to drain from the pericardial tube, compatible with the diagnosis of chylopericardium. The lack of clinical response to total parenteral nutrition and intravenous infusion of octreotide imposed the need of interventional radiology with diagnostic lymphography through cisterna chyli puncture and thoracic duct catheterization, confirming the presence of a lymphatic fistula. A successful treatment outcome was achieved with percutaneous thoracic duct embolization using coils and n-butyl-cyanoacrilate glue, possibiliting hospital discharge. Fungal endocarditis requires combined treatment (surgical and antimicrobial) for eradication. Valve replacement, while necessary, may lead to severe ventricular deterioration and heart transplantation may be the only viable therapeutic solution. Among the several postoperative complications of heart transplantation, chylopericardium is an uncommon and defiant example. Advances in interventional radiology like the percutaneous embolization allow a less invasive and highly efficient approach for this complication.
