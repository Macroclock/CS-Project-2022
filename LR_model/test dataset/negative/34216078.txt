Moderate acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination in patients pre- and post-heart transplantation: Experiences from a German Transplant Centre. Patients awaiting heart transplantation (HTx) are at increased risk developing severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients supported by a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) face additional risks due to coagulopathies during COVID-19. Following HTx, elevated risk factors for severe COVID-19 persist due to chronic immunosuppression and frequent comorbidities. Taken together, COVID-19 vaccination is of critical importance in all three patient cohorts. Here, we report our experience to deliver COVID-19 vaccination in a German transplant center. We screened 211 patients for contraindications and offered the remaining 186 eligible patients COVID-19 vaccination. Of those, 133 patients (71%) accepted the offer and were vaccinated. Acceptance of vaccination differed between HTx recipients (84 of 113, 74%), patients on the waiting list (34 of 47, 72%), and patients with LVAD support (28 of 50, 56%). The LVAD cohort demonstrated lower acceptance levels for vaccination compared to HTx recipients and patients awaiting HTx (74% vs. 56%; p = 0.028). We demonstrate for the first time only moderate acceptance levels of COVID-19 vaccination in HTx recipients and candidates on the waiting list compared to general population, despite perceived high-risk for severe disease. Additionally, those supported by LVAD have even lower adherence. Efforts may need to be made to increase acceptance in this vulnerable as well as cost-intensive patient cohort.
