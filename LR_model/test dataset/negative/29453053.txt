Ultrasound molecular imaging of acute cardiac transplantation rejection using nanobubbles targeted to T lymphocytes. Clinical surveillance of acute heart transplantation rejection requires repeated invasive endomyocardial biopsies and noninvasive diagnostic techniques are desperately needed. It is acknowledged that T lymphocyte infiltration is the central process of acute rejection. We hypothesized that ultrasound molecular imaging with T lymphocyte-targeted nanobubbles could be used to detect acute rejection in heart transplantation. In this study, nanobubbles bearing anti-CD3 antibody (NB 'Heart transplantation', 'Rejection', 'T lymphocyte', 'Ultrasound molecular imaging'
