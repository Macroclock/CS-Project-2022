Role of C1q complement fixing antibody assay in therapeutic plasma exchange management of pediatric cardiac antibody mediated rejection. Pediatric cardiac transplant patients with antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) often undergo therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) to remove pathologic donor specific antibodies (DSA). In cases where DSA persist, it is unclear how long TPE should be continued. We report a case of a 17-year-old cardiac transplant patient with AMR where use of a C1q complement fixing antibody assay helped guide TPE cessation. This report adds to the existing literature that highlights the potential clinical significance of C1q antibodies in AMR management.
