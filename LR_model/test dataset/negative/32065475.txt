Heart transplantation from donation after circulatory death donors: Present and future. The first successful human heart transplantation was reported on 3 December 1967, by Christiaan Barnard in South Africa. Since then this life-saving procedure has been performed in over 120 000 patients. A limitation to the performance of this procedure is the availability of donor hearts with as many as 20% of patients dying before a donor's heart is available for transplant. Today, hearts for transplantation are procured from individuals experiencing donation after brain death (DBD). Interestingly, this, however, was not always the case as the first heart transplants occurred after circulatory death. Revisiting the availability of hearts for transplant from those experiencing donation after circulatory death (DCD) could further expand the number of hearts suitable for transplantation. There are several considerations pertinent to transplanting hearts from those undergoing circulatory death. In this review, we summarize the main distinctions between DBD and DCD heart donation and discuss the research relevant to increasing the number of hearts available for transplantation by including individual's hearts that experience circulatory death.
