Use of the Jarvik 2000 continuous flow left ventricular assist device for acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock. Several strategies for circulatory support have been successfully utilized as bridges to recovery or transplantation after acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock. We report the novel use of a continuous flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for successful recovery and bridging to transplantation in a patient who had massive anterior wall myocardial infarction.
