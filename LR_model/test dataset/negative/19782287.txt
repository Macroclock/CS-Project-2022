Transforming growth factor-beta polymorphisms and cardiac allograft rejection. Cytokine gene polymorphisms regulate cytokine expression. We analyzed transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) allelic variation in codon 25 in susceptibility to acute rejection episodes in cardiac transplant recipients. Between June 1997 and December 2001, 123 de novo heart transplants were performed at UAB with analysis based on 109 patients. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded at intervals up to 1 year post-transplant. Recipient genotypes for TGF-beta (codon 25) were determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequence-specific primers. Correlations between TGF-beta genotypes and acute rejection were made using Kaplan-Meier plots and parametric hazard models. Of the patients enrolled, 72% had at least one rejection and 46% had multiple rejections in the first year post-transplant. Among those > or =55 years of age at transplant, patients with the GG genotype had significantly fewer rejections as compared to those with the CC or GC genotype (1.25 vs 2.5, p < 0.01). There was no difference in risk of rejection between the genotype groups among patients <50 years of age at transplant (p = 0.43). Similar results were observed when we used time to cumulative Grade 2R or greater rejection as the outcome. The GG TGF-beta genotype may protect against acute rejection in older recipients during the first year after transplant.
