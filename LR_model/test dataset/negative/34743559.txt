Trends and Outcomes of Cardiac Transplantation in the Lowest Urgency Candidates. Background Because of discrepancies between donor supply and recipient demand, the cardiac transplantation process aims to prioritize the most medically urgent patients. It remains unknown how recipients with the lowest medical urgency compare to others in the allocation process. We aimed to examine differences in clinical characteristics, organ allocation patterns, and outcomes between cardiac transplantation candidates with the lowest and highest medical urgency. Methods and Results We performed a retrospective analysis of the United Network for Organ Sharing database. Patients listed for cardiac transplantation between January 2011 and May 2020 were stratified according to status at time of transplantation. Baseline recipient and donor characteristics, waitlist survival, and posttransplantation outcomes were compared in the years before and after the 2018 allocation system change. Lower urgency patients in the old system were older (58.5 versus 56Â years) and more likely female (54.4% versus 23.8%) compared with the highest urgency patients, and these trends persisted in the new system ( 'UNOS', 'advanced heart failure', 'heart transplantation', 'outcomes research'
