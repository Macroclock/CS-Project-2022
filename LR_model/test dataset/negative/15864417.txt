Absent mRNA accumulation of Th1 or Th2 cytokines in heart allografts with chimerism-based drug-induced tolerance. We recently described using cyclophosphamide (CP) plus busulfan (BU) to create drug-induced skin and heart allograft tolerance capable of regularly overcoming fully H-2 mismatched barriers in mice. The present study investigates the intragraft mRNA expressions of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. This method consists of the intravenous (i.v.) injection of 1 x 10(8) allogeneic spleen cells on day 0, the intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg CP and 30 mg/kg BU on day 2, and the i.v. injection of 1 x 10(7) T cell-depleted allogeneic bone marrow cells from the same strain of mice on day 3. Heart grafting (HG) was performed on day 28. Chimerism in the peripheral blood was monitored by flow cytometric (FCM) analysis. The frequency of certain V(beta) families was determined by FCM to assess deletion of donor-reactive T cells. Th1 (interleukin [IL]-2, interferon [IFN]-gamma) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-10) cytokine expression in the heart grafts was analyzed with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In a fully MHC mismatched combination of B10.D2 (H-2d, IE+) --> B10 (H-2b, IE-), B10.D2 heart grafts were accepted permanently in a donor-specific manner, mixed chimerism was observed, and IE-reactive V(beta)11+ T cells were specifically reduced in the periphery from the recipient B10 mice. In the donor B10.D2 heart grafts, there was no accumulation of Th1 (IL-2, IFN-gamma) or Th2 (IL-4, IL-10) cytokines. These results show that the drug-induced tolerance we established can regularly induce long-lasting heart allograft tolerance without intragraft mRNA accumulation of Th1 or Th2.
