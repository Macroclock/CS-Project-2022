Impact of Sex in the Efficacy of Perioperative Desensitization Procedures in Heart Transplantation: A Retrospective Cohort Study. Sensitized patients, i.e. recipients with preformed donor-specific HLA antibodies (pfDSA), are at high-risk of developing antibody-mediated rejections (AMR) and dying after heart transplantation (HTx). Perioperative desensitization procedures are associated with better outcomes but can cause sensitization, which may influence their efficacy. In sensitized patients (pfDSA>1000 mean immunofluorescence (MFI) units), we assessed the effect of perioperative desensitization by comparing treated patients to a historical control cohort. Multivariable survival analyses were performed on the time to main outcome, a composite of death and biopsy-proven AMR with 5-year follow-up. The study included 68 patients: 31 control and 37 treated patients. There was no difference in preoperative variables between the two groups, including cumulative pfDSA [4026 (1788;8725)  Perioperative desensitization was associated with fewer AMR and deaths after HTx, and efficacy was more pronounced in men than women.
