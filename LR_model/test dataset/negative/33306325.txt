Heterotopic Heart Transplantation as a Left Ventricular Biological Assistance: a New Two-Stage Method Proposal. Since Barnard's first heterotopic heart transplant in 1974, Copeland's method has been the greatest contribution to heterotopic transplants but has the drawback of donor's right ventricular atrophy. This new method proposes a modification in the anastomosis of the superior vena cava aiming to pre-serve donor's right ventricular function by decompressing the pulmonary territory and reducing the pulmonary arterial pressure, as a biological ventricular assist device. Finally, a second intervention is proposed, where a "twist" is performed to place the donor's heart in an orthotopic position after re-moval of the native heart. A pioneering research on this method received approval from the ethics committee of the Heart Institute of SÃ£o Paulo. We believe that this method has the potential to im-prove quality of life in a selected group of patients.
