Left Ventricular Assist Device Insertion in a Patient With Biventricular Noncompaction Cardiomyopathy, Ebstein Anomaly, and a Left Atrial Mass: A Case Report. In this report, we present the case of a patient with biventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy, Ebstein anomaly, and a left atrial mass who required emergent placement of a left ventricular assist device. The noncompaction cardiomyopathy complicated the left ventricular assist device implantation procedure because the thickened, trabeculated myocardium made it difficult to place the inflow cannula. We discuss our perioperative management strategy, in which transesophageal echocardiography was used, to help the surgical team identify the proper cannula placement and provide a bridge to transplantation.
