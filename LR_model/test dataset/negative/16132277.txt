Predictors of graft longevity in pediatric heart transplantation. Given the volume of pediatric orthotopic heart transplants (OHTs) at several centers, it is now possible to generate pediatric-specific, single-center OHT survival data. The transplant experience for 152 pediatric OHT patients at our institution was reviewed. The following were noted for each patient: graft survival; immunosuppressant therapy; initial diagnosis; cause of graft failure; clinical status at time of transplant; donor and recipient blood type, sex, weight, and age; ischemic time; previous cardiac surgery; race; and immune status. A series of Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed. Univariate comparisons of survival curves were performed with the Breslow test to determine equality of each pair of curves. Only immunosuppression with tacrolimus and an initial diagnosis of noncongenital heart disease positively influenced survival in pediatric OHT patients (p < or = 0.021 and p < or = 0.03, respectively). The more recently transplanted patients, managed with tacrolimus, had less mortality early after OHT (acute rejection) and less mortality during the period 2 or 3 years after OHT. No other factors, including prior cardiothoracic surgery, sex matching, and race matching, significantly influenced survival. Recently transplanted patients managed with tacrolimus-based immunosuppression and patients with noncongenital cardiomyopathy have significantly superior graft survival.
