Multi-detector row computed tomographic angiography in pediatric heart transplant recipients: Initial observations. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and limitation of multi-detector row computed tomographic (MDCT) imaging for evaluating coronary arteries in pediatric heart transplant patients. Coronary MDCT angiography was performed in eight pediatric heart transplant recipients. The presence of coronary calcification was evaluated. Luminal changes of the visualized coronary segments on MDCT images were compared with catheter angiographic findings and intravascular ultrasound. Coronary calcification was present in one patient who had severe coronary arteriopathy documented by intravascular ultrasound. In 48 coronary segments visualized on MDCT images, 33, 7, and 4 segments each had normal, luminal irregularities, and moderate stenoses, respectively, which were confirmed by catheter angiography. Twelve coronary segments could not be assessed because of severe motion artifacts. Image quality degradation was more pronounced in patients with higher heart rates. Noninvasive MDCT angiography is promising but requires further technical improvement to evaluate coronary arteries in pediatric heart transplant patients.
