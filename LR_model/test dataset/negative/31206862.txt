Desensitization in heart transplant recipients: Who, when, and how. The number of heart transplant candidates who have pre-formed antibodies against human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) is increasing over time. The purpose of this review is to discuss the process of antibody desensitization for heart transplant candidates. Specifically, we review the current status of antibody detection including identification, strength, and potential pathogenicity. We discuss which patients and when should they undergo desensitization therapies during heart transplant evaluation. Specific therapies including mechanical removal of antibodies, intravenous immunoglobulins, and novel immunosuppressive agents targeting antibody production will be discussed. Finally, future research strategies to develop novel desensitization therapies for heart transplant candidates will be reviewed. 'desensitization', 'heart disease', 'sensitization'
