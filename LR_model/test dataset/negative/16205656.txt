Bone marrow-derived recipient cells in murine transplanted hearts: potential roles and the effect of immunosuppression. Currently, there is intense debate regarding the origin of reparative cells in injured hearts and vasculature. To determine the contribution of recipient bone marrow (BM)-derived cells to the regeneration of cells in the vasculature of transplanted hearts and to examine the effect of immunosuppression on this phenomenon, we evaluated the fate of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive recipient BM cells in non-GFP-expressing cardiac allografts. C57BL/6 BM-GFP chimeric recipients underwent cardiac transplantation. Allografts were immunosuppressed with tacrolimus for 14 or 30 days post-transplantation or were saline treated. Hearts were excised and stained with markers for endothelial cells (EC) or smooth muscle cells (SMC). Colocalization with BM-derived recipient cells was evaluated using confocal microscopy with three-dimensional image analysis. Immunosuppression with tacrolimus did not affect the frequency of recipient BM-derived cell chimerism as EC or SMC phenotypes. A higher frequency of EC chimerism was found at 14 days as compared to 30 days post-transplantation in allograft hearts. BM-derived recipient cells are recruited to areas of donor vascular injury with intercalation of recipient EC and SMC in the setting of ongoing alloimmune recognition of the allograft. Our findings confirm that immunosuppression with tacrolimus does not affect the frequency of recipient BM-derived cell repopulation at an early time point 14 days post-transplantation. EC repopulation by BM-derived recipient cells was found to be an early event in transplanted allograft hearts, which decreased in frequency over time.
