The Position of the Heart During Normothermic Ex Situ Heart Perfusion is an Important Factor in Preservation and Recovery of Myocardial Function. Ex situ heart perfusion (ESHP) is being investigated as a method for the continuous preservation of the myocardium in a semiphysiologic state for subsequent transplantation. Most methods of ESHP position the isolated heart in a hanging (H) state, representing a considerable departure from the in vivo anatomical positioning of the heart and may negatively affect the functional preservation of the heart. In the current study, cardiac functional and metabolic parameters were assessed in healthy pig hearts, perfused for 12 hours, in either an H, or supported (S) position, either in nonworking mode (NWM) or working mode (WM). The cardiac function was best preserved in the S position hearts in WM (median 11 hour cardiac index (CI)/1 hour CI%: working mode perfusion in supported position = 94.77% versus nonworking mode perfusion in supported position = 62.80%, working mode perfusion in H position = 36.18%, nonworking mode perfusion in H position = 9.75%; p < 0.001). Delivery of pyruvate bolus significantly improved the function in S groups, however, only partially reversed myocardial dysfunction in the H heart groups. The hearts perfused ex situ in a semianatomical S position and in physiologic WM had better functional preservation and recovery than the H hearts in non-S position. Optimizing the positional support for the ex situ-perfused hearts may improve myocardial preservation during ESHP.
