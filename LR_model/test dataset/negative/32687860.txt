MiR-669b-3p regulates CD4 Acute rejection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after solid organ transplantation. Therefore, optimizing treatment strategies and improving curative effect is urgent and necessary. Reliable biomarkers for acute rejection and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be determined. In this study, we established a mouse-to-mouse cardiac transplantation model and identified miR-669b-3p as a potential biomarker of acute rejection using a microRNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based chip assay. Further analyses showed that miR-669b-3p negatively regulated indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), a rate-limiting enzyme of tryptophan catabolism inhibiting T cell function. Using mixed lymphocyte reaction assay, we showed that miR-669b-3p increased proliferation stimulation index and inhibited apoptosis in CD4 Our results advance the current understanding of the immune regulatory function of miRNA and shed light on the role of miR-669b-3p in CD4 'Acute rejection', 'CD4+ T cell', 'Cardiac transplantation', 'IDO', 'MiR-669b-3p'
