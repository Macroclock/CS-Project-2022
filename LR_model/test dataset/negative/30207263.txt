Recommendations from the Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology for clinical training in paediatric heart failure and transplantation. Advanced medical and surgical treatment of heart failure and management of patients following heart transplantation is an emerging area. Treatment options at various levels are becoming available in an increasing number of countries. This rapidly evolving field involves a complex multi-disciplinary approach with a number of complementary medical and surgical strategies, including pharmacotherapy, structural cardiac interventions, electrophysiological optimisation, mechanical circulatory support, and heart transplantation. Furthermore, the importance of psycho-social support and care of patients and their families cannot be overstated. The aforementioned challenges and dynamics of new developments require guidance for core and advanced medical training in heart failure and transplantation. The Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology working group "pulmonary hypertension, heart failure and transplantation" has produced this document as an expert consensus statement; however, all recommendations must be considered and applied in the context of the local and national infrastructure and legal regulations.
