Comprehensive evaluation of lung allograft function in infants after lung and heart-lung transplantation. Limited data exist on methods to evaluate allograft function in infant recipients of lung and heart-lung transplants. At our institution, we developed a procedural protocol in coordination with pediatric anesthesia where infants were sedated to perform infant pulmonary function testing, computed tomography imaging of the chest, and flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsies. A retrospective review was performed of children aged younger than 1 year who underwent lung or heart-lung transplantation at our institution to assess the effect of this procedural protocol in the evaluation of infant lung allografts. Since 2005, 5 infants have undergone thoracic transplantation (3 heart-lung, 2 lung). At time of transplant, the mean ± standard deviation age was 7.2 ± 2.8 months (range, 3-11 months). Of 24 procedural sessions performed to evaluate lung allografts, 83% (20 of 24) were considered surveillance where the patients were completely asymptomatic. Of the surveillance procedures, 80% were performed as an outpatient, whereas 20% were done as inpatients during the lung or heart-lung transplant post-operative period before discharge home. Sedation was performed with propofol alone (23 of 24) or in addition to ketamine (1 of 24) infusion; mean sedation time was 141 ± 39 minutes (range, 70-214) minutes. Of the 16 outpatient procedures, patients were discharged after 14 (88%) on the same day, and after 2 (12%) were admitted for observation, with 1 being due to transportation issues and the other due to fever during the observation period. A comprehensive procedural protocol to evaluate allograft function in infant lung and heart-lung transplant recipients was performed safely as an outpatient.
