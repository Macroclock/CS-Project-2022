Role of Radiotherapy in Post-transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorders: Three Case Reports and Review of the Literature. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is an aggressive malignancy that occurs in patients who have undergone solid organ transplantation or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It develops as the result of uncontrolled cell proliferations owing to reduced immunological surveillance. PTLD may occur with a various spectrum of clinical presentations, including both localized and extensive disease. Management can be significantly variable according both to the clinical presentation and to the histologic features. The most important systemic treatment strategies are reduction of immunosuppressive therapy, chemotherapy, anti B-cell antibodies, especially rituximab and cytokine-based therapies. The localized form of PTLD could be efficiently treated, and potentially cured, with surgery or radiotherapy (RT). Involved site RT may be a feasible effective option for the treatment of patients with PTLD, given the excellent radio-sensitivity of lymphoid disorders. In this report, we describe 3 adult patients with PTLD treated with moderate-dose RT (24-36 Gy) having a good local control with negligible toxicity. We also review the literature data on the role of radiation therapy in this particular setting. 'Chemotherapy', 'ISRT', 'PTLD', 'Radiotherapy', 'Transplant'
