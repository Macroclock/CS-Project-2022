Determinants and prognostic implications of the negative diastolic pulmonary pressure gradient in patients with pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease. The diastolic pulmonary pressure gradient (DPG) has recently been introduced as a specific marker of combined pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension (Cpc-PH) in left heart disease (LHD). However, its diagnostic and prognostic superiority compared with traditional haemodynamic indices has been challenged lately. Current recommendations explicitly denote that in the normal heart, DPG values are greater than zero, with DPG â‰¥7 mmHg indicating Cpc-PH. However, clinicians are perplexed by the frequent observation of DPG <0 mmHg (DPG Right heart catheterization and echocardiography were performed in 316 patients with LHD due to primary myocardial dysfunction or valvular disease. A total of 256 patients had PH-LHD, of whom 48% demonstrated DPG Our results advocate against DPG 'Diastolic pressure gradient', 'Pulmonary hypertension', 'V-wave'
