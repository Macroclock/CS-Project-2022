Serotonin Syndrome Following Terbutaline Administration in a Heart Transplant Patient on Multiple Inotropic Agents: A Case Report. The significance of serotonin syndrome due to drug-drug interactions has emerged as a prominent consideration when the effects of polypharmacy are reviewed. The emergence of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors has most likely fueled the increased reporting of serotonin syndrome in the literature, leading to increased awareness of this phenomenon. However, their presence is not necessarily inclusive to a case and the utilization of agents precipitating an occurrence may be unavoidable. We report a case of serotonin syndrome occurring in a heart transplant patient without the presence of any of the usual suspect agents involved. In the postoperative course, the patient developed cardiogenic shock with vasoplegia requiring continuation of inotropic therapy along with vasopressor support of epinephrine. Oral terbutaline was begun for hemodynamic improvement. The patient's tenuous mental status rapidly deteriorated after addition of the terbutaline, with symptoms consistent with serotonin syndrome. Administration of cyproheptadine, a known reversal agent for serotonin toxicity, rapidly alleviated the adverse symptoms.
