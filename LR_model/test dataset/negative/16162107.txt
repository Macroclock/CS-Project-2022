Quantitative mRNA expression analysis of co-stimulatory molecules in sequential biopsies from heart allografts. Allograft-specific T-cell activation requires two signals, "signal one" via the T-cell receptor and "signal two" via costimulatory pathways. Animal models provide promising data that blockade of costimulatory signals can lead to T-cell anergy and tolerance. We analyzed 72 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sequential heart allograft biopsies from 22 patients by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the mRNA expression of the costimulatory molecules CD28, CD80, CD86, CD40, and CD154. mRNA expression levels were correlated to histological grade and time-point of rejection. mRNA expression of costimulatory molecules predominantly expressed by antigen-presenting cells (CD80, CD86, CD40), correlated with histological grade of cell-mediated acute rejection. Costimulatory molecules were up-regulated not only during rejection episodes early after transplantation, but also at late occurring rejection. The present results suggest a simultaneous and long-term therapeutical blockade of more than one costimulatory pathway for the prevention of repetitive T-cell mediated acute rejection episodes after heart transplantation.
