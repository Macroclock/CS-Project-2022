Combination of N, N'-dicyclohexyl-N-arachidonic acylurea and tacrolimus prolongs cardiac allograft survival in mice. Current immunosuppressive agents for organ transplantation are not ideal because of their strong toxicity and adverse effects. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop novel immunosuppressive agents. The compound N, N'-dicyclohexyl-N-arachidonic acylurea (DCAAA) is a novel highly unsaturated fatty acid from the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Radix Isatidis. In this study, we systematically investigated the toxicity, immunosuppressive effect and mechanisms underlying the activity of DCAAA. The toxicity tests showed that DCAAA treatment did not lead to red blood cell hemolysis and did not affect the liver and kidney functions in mice. The lymphocyte transformation test showed that DCAAA treatment inhibited lymphocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. An in vivo cardiac allotransplantation experiment showed that DCAAA treatment could suppress the immune rejection and significantly prolong the survival of cardiac allografts in recipient mice by reducing the proportion of CD4 '\nRadix Isatidis\n', 'Cell cycle', 'PI3K/Akt', 'heart transplantation', 'immunosuppressive agent', 'tacrolimus'
