Case of Paracoccus yeei infection documented in a transplanted heart. After a successful cardiac transplantation, routine endomyocardial biopsies showed severe infiltrates comparable with myocarditis. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of native myocardial samples revealed infection with Paracoccus yeei, and the clinical condition of the patient deteriorated. After administration of ciprofloxacin, his clinical condition improved, and further biopsies showed no infiltrates in the cardiac specimens. To our knowledge this is the first documented case of P. yeei infection in a heart transplant patient.
