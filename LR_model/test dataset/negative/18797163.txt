Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders after heart or kidney transplantation at a single centre: presentation and response to treatment. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) is a serious complication after solid organ transplantation. Reduction of immunosuppression (RI) alone is not able to control the disease. We report a prospective analysis of 30 patients with PTLD after heart or kidney transplantation. Only 5 of 30 patients, treated solely with RI, obtained a complete response. Five patients were treated heterogeneously; in the remaining 20, the efficacy and safety of a weekly anthracycline-based chemotherapy were assessed. Sixteen patients obtained a complete remission. One death was related to treatment. With a median follow-up of 36 months, 3-year overall survival was 63.3% and 57% for the entire group and the chemotherapy-treated group, respectively. Moreover, 4 second neoplasms were observed in the chemotherapeutic group. In this study, we demonstrated that most PTLD need other treatment than RI and a weekly regimen is manageable and has a favourable impact on long-term survival.
