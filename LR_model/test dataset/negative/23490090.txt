Epidemiology and clinical impact of infection in patients awaiting heart transplantation. The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiology and clinical impact of infections in patients awaiting heart transplantation. We evaluated all patients considered for a heart transplant in our center over a period of 18 months over a period of 18 months from 2007 to 2009. The patients were followed up for 8 months or until death, transplant, or loss to follow-up. Ninety patients were included in the study. During follow-up, 25 infections were recorded in 22 heart transplant candidates (24.4%). Respiratory infections were the most frequent infection (12 bronchitis; 48.0%), followed by skin and soft tissue infections (four infections; 16.0%), intra-abdominal infections (four infectious diarrhea; 16.0%), bacteremia (three infections; 12.0%), and urinary tract infections (two infections; 2.0%). Age, comorbidity, sex, and diabetes were not found to be risk factors for infection. Twenty-four patients (26.7%) were transplanted during follow-up. Infection before transplantation was not associated with an increased risk of mortality or a higher rate of infection in the immediate post-transplant period. Infections are common in heart transplant candidates, affecting almost 25% of them. Respiratory tract infections are the most frequent type of infection. However, they are not associated with increased mortality in the immediate post-transplant period. 'Heart transplantation', 'Infection', 'Waiting list'
