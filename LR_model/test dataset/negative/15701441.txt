Use of bivalirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, and its reversal with modified ultrafiltration during heart transplantation in a patient with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an increasingly common clinical finding in patients presenting for cardiac transplantation. Bivalrudin, a reversible direct thrombin inhibitor, is a molecular anti-coagulant with short half-life and the potential for removal by intraoperative hemofiltration. Herein we describe the dosing and intraoperative management of bivalrudin anti-coagulation in a patient undergoing urgent cardiac transplantation in the context of recently diagnosed HIT.
