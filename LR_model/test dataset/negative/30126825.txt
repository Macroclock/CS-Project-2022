Cardiac transplantation from non-viremic hepatitis C donors. Hepatitis C (HCV) donors are rarely used for cardiac transplantation due to historically poor outcomes. In 2015, nucleic acid testing (NAT) for viral load was added to the routine work-up of organ donors, allowing for the distinction between subjects who remain viremic (HCV Ab All patients were counseled regarding donor HCV antibody (Ab) and NAT. Transplant recipients were tested post-transplant at 1 week and at 1, 3, and 6 months for HCV seropositivity and viremia. We also analyzed the UNOS database to determine the potential impact of widespread acceptance of HCV Ab Fourteen HCV Ab We have demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing HCV Ab 'heart transplant', 'hepatitis C', 'immunsupression', 'nucleic acid testing', 'viremia'
