Use of Idarucizumab to reverse the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran in cardiac transplant surgery. A multicentric experience in Spain. Anticoagulation in heart transplant (HT) recipients increases the risk of hemorrhagic complications, so correct reversal of anticoagulation is needed. Dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, is increasingly used for anticoagulation in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) whose effect can be reversed by idarucizumab. To present a nationwide experience using idarucizumab for the urgent reversal of dabigatran before HT. Multicenter observational study in 12 Spanish centers to analyze the clinical outcomes after using idarucizumab before HT surgery. Fifty-three patients were included (81.1% male). 7.5% required re-operation in the immediate postoperative period to control bleeding and 66% transfusion of blood products. Median length of stay in the intensive care unit was 6 days and total hospital stay 24 days. 30-day survival was 92.4%. There were four deaths in the first month, all in the first 5 days post-HT. Only in one patient (transplanted due to a congenital heart disease, after sternotomy) who had surgical problems and right ventricular failure post-HT death was associated with bleeding. These results may support the use of dabigatran as an alternative to vitamin K antagonists in patients listed for HT requiring anticoagulation due to NVAF. More studies are needed to reaffirm these observations. 'dabigatran', 'heart transplant', 'idarucizumab'
