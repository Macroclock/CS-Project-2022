Retransplantation of multiple organs: how many organs should one individual receive? Every year, the transplant waiting list gets longer, while donor numbers essentially remain the same. This makes the responsibility of being good stewards of this precious and limited resource greater than ever. Transplant teams, who are both committed to their patients and aware of this important responsibility, are left to make the difficult and ethical decisions regarding retransplantation. Retransplantation of organs in pediatric patients presents a different set of issues to consider, and the results are promising. This case study presents a boy who received a kidney transplant for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis at age 5. At age 11, because of the recurrence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and severe cardiomyopathy, he required a rare combined kidney-heart transplant. At age 17, he developed chronic renal failure and posttransplant coronary artery disease, most likely related to a period of noncompliance, and required yet another combined kidney-heart transplant. He is currently alive and well 2 years after transplantation.
