Heme oxygenase-1 and transplantation tolerance. Tolerance is the ultimate goal of transplantation: the lack of any need for immunosuppression with long-term survival of the transplanted tissue and a full immunological response to all antigens other than those on the transplant. In honor of my dear friend and colleague, Prof. Dr. Jon van Rood, I summarize here our work in this area making use of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and the products that degradation of heme by HO-1 generates.
