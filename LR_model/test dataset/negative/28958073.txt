Five-year results of patients supported by HeartMate II: outcomes and adverse events. Improved outcomes over the past decade have increased confidence of physicians and patients in extended duration of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support. This single-centre cohort study reports 5-year outcomes with the HeartMate II (HMII) LVAD. We describe a cohort of 89 patients who received a HMII LVAD between February 2004 and December 2010. The causes of death and adverse events were assessed by examination of medical records. A total of 202.74 patient-years were analysed. After 5 years, of the 89 patients, 15 patients remained on device therapy, 39 patients died, 28 patients underwent heart transplantation and 7 patients underwent explantation of the HMII for recovery. One year after the HMII implantation, there was a survival of 71% in the study cohort. In the following years, the survival rate was 65% in the 2nd year, 63% in the 3rd year, 56% in the 4th year and 54% after 5 years of LVAD support. Ten LVAD exchanges were performed in 8 (11%) patients. Currently (March 2017), 12 patients still remain on their original device. The longest ongoing patient on the HMII has been supported for over 11 years (4097 days). The most common adverse events were bleeding (68%; 1.5837 events per patient-year) and LVAD infection [49%; 1.0666 events per patient-year]. Seven cases of pump thrombosis were described (8%; 0.1131 events per patient-year). This is the first single-cohort study to describe a 5-year survival of HMII patients on extended duration of support. A 5-year survival of 54% was observed in this single-centre cohort.
