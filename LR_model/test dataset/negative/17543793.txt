Trichilemmal carcinoma of the skin mimicking a keloid in a heart transplant recipient. Trichilemmal carcinoma is a rare cutaneous adnexal malignant tumor deriving from the outer root sheath of hair follicles. It is only rarely reported in recipients of solid (renal) organ transplants.

We then briefly outline the salient clinicopathologic features of this malignancy.
