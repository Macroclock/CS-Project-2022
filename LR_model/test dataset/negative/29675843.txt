An alternative technique of arterial anastomosis in mouse heart transplantation. To investigate the characters and feasibility of continuous-interrupted suture (CIS) method for arterial anastomosis in mouse heart transplantation (MHT). A MHT model was adopted. End-to-end anastomosis of donor ascending aorta to recipient abdominal aorta was achieved by CIS or continuous suture (CS) method. In both groups, end-to-end anastomosis of pulmonary vein to inferior vena cava (IVC) was achieved by CS. Technical indexes and histological examination were analyzed between 2 groups. The total operative time in CIS group was 92.83 ± 2.13 minutes, and in CS group was 92.40 ± 3.85 minutes. In CS group, artery anastomosis time was 20.13 ± 1.89 minutes; in CIS group, it was 20.36 ± 1.09 minutes. Additionally, venous anastomosis time in CS group was 14.80 ± 0.84 minutes, and in CIS group was 15.03 ± 0.85 minutes. Operation success rate in CIS group was 100%, and in CS group was 80%. There were no significant histological findings differences in graft between 2 groups. However, cell arrangement of anastomosis site was lightly irregular and the vascular alignment was poor in CS group. In CIS group, cell arrangement of anastomosis site was well arranged and vessels were well aligned. CIS method could avoid arterial anastomosis-related complications induced by CS and improve the success rate.
