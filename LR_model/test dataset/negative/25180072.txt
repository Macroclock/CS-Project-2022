Outcomes after implantation of 139 full-support continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices as a bridge to transplantation. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are a routine treatment for patients with advanced heart failure as a bridge to transplantation. The aim of this study was to present our institutional experience and mid-term outcomes after implantation of 139 continuous-flow (cf) LVADs as a bridge to transplantation. One hundred and thirty-nine consecutive LVAD implantations were performed in our institution between July 2007 and August 2013. The mean age of the population was 44.0 ± 13.7 years and 24 (17%) of the patients were female. A substantial number of the patients were on preoperative mechanical support: 35 (25%) with an intra-aortic balloon pump, 9 (6.5%) with an extracorporeal membrane oxygenator and 25 (18%) with previous LVAD, for LVAD exchange. The mean support duration was 514 ± 481 days, whereas the longest support duration was 2493 days (>6 years). The overall cumulative survival rate following cfLVAD implantation was 89% at 30 days, 76% at 1 year and 66% at 2 years (Fig. 1). There was a statistically significant difference in survival in favour of first LVAD implantation compared with VAD exchange: 91 vs 80% at 30 days, 79 vs 57% at 1 year and 70 vs 43% at 2 years (log-rank P = 0.010). Postoperatively, patients had a significant improvement in end-organ function 1 month after LVAD implantation. In addition, comparison of two different devices [HeartMate II (HM II) and HeartWare] using propensity score matching showed no significant differences in survival and most postoperative adverse events. However, patients supported with HM II required significantly more units of fresh frozen plasma (P = 0.020) with a trend towards a higher use of red blood cells (P = 0.094), and were also more likely to develop percutaneous site infections (P = 0.022). HM II and HeartWare cfLVADs have excellent early postoperative outcomes and good mid-term survival, despite a considerable number of patients needing VAD exchange.
