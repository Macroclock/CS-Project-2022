Massive Thrombosis of the Transplanted Heart in the Early Postoperative Period. We experienced a case with the left atrium almost completely filled with a thrombus after orthotopic heart transplantation while the patient was supported on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for primary graft failure. The patient had recurrent thrombosis even after successful surgical thrombectomy and appropriate anticoagulation. The cardiac thrombosis resolved only after starting plasmapheresis.
