Echocardiographic evaluation of the Jarvik 2000 axial-flow LVAD. From April 2000 through September 2001, we studied 11 patients with the Jarvik 2000--a left ventricular assist device with an axial-flow pump that provides continuous blood flow--to determine the echocardiographic characteristics. All patients underwent complete echocardiographic examination, including outflow-graft flow evaluation 24 hours after implantation and each month thereafter for the duration of support. Data were obtained at each pump setting (8000-12000 rpm in 1000-rpm increments) and with the pump off. Left ventricular dimensions and shortening fraction and the duration of aortic valve systolic opening decreased as pump speed increased. Although the aortic valve remained closed at higher pump speeds, pump outflow-graft flow remained pulsatile, because of the systolic thrust of the assisted ventricle. Systolic dominance of phasic flow was more pronounced at lower pump speeds, due to normalization of the diseased heart's Starling response. When the aortic valve was closed continuously, echocardiographic contrast (indicating blood stasis) was noted in the aortic root. Because of the pump outflow graft's proximity to the chest wall, device output could be measured independently of cardiac contributions. Mean peak outflow-graft flow velocities were 0.75 +/- 0.30 m/s (systolic) and 0.41 +/- 0. 13 m/s (diastolic). When the pump was turned off briefly there was minimal regurgitation through the device into the left ventricle. This 1st echocardiographic heart function analysis of the Jarvik 2000 confirms that the device unloads the ventricle and increases cardiac output. Cardiac responses to device-speed changes can be evaluated readily with echocardiography in the early and late postoperative period.
