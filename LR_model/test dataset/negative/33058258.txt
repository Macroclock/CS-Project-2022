Does pediatric heart transplant survival differ with various cardiac preservation solutions? Few studies directly compare outcomes between the most commonly used preservation solutions in pediatric heart transplantation in a large cohort of recipients. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of cardiac preservation solution on survival in pediatric heart transplant recipients. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was retrospectively reviewed from 01/2004-03/2018 for pediatric donor hearts. Saline, University of Wisconsin (UW), "cardioplegia," Celsior, and Custodiol preservation solutions were evaluated. The primary endpoints were recipient survival at 30 days, 1 year, and long term. After exclusion criteria, 3012 recipients had preservation solution data available. The most common preservation solution used was UW in 1203 patients (40%), followed by Celsior in 542 (18%), cardioplegia in 461 (15%), saline in 408 (14%), and Custodiol in 398 (13%). Survival of recipients whose donor hearts were procured with UW was as follows: 97%-30 day, 92%-1 year; Celsior: 97%-30 day, 92%-1 year; cardioplegia: 97%-30 day, 91%-1 year; saline: 97%-30 day, 91%-1 year; and Custodiol: 96%-30 day and 92%-1 year. Analysis of Cox models for 30-day and long-term survival revealed no statistical differences when comparing UW to Celsior (p = .333), cardioplegia (p = .914), saline (p = .980), or Custodiol (p = .642) in adjusted models. There were no significant differences in 30-day or 1-year survival detected between commonly used preservation solutions in the pediatric heart transplant population.
