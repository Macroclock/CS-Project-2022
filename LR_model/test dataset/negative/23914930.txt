Endogenous memory CD8 T cells are activated within cardiac allografts without mediating rejection. Endogenous memory CD8 T cells infiltrate MHC-mismatched cardiac allografts within 12-24 h posttransplant in mice and are activated to proliferate and produce IFN-γ. To more accurately assess the graft injury directly imposed by these endogenous memory CD8 T cells, we took advantage of the ability of anti-LFA-1 mAb given to allograft recipients on days 3 and 4 posttransplant to inhibit the generation of primary effector T cells. When compared to grafts from IgG-treated recipients on day 7 posttransplant, allografts from anti-LFA-1 mAb-treated recipients had increased numbers of CD8 T cells but these grafts had marked decreases in expression levels of mRNA encoding effector mediators associated with graft injury and decreases in donor-reactive CD8 T cells producing IFN-γ. Despite this decreased activity within the allograft, CD8 T cells in allografts from recipients treated with anti-LFA-1 mAb continued to proliferate up to day 7 posttransplant and did not upregulate expression of the exhaustion marker LAG-3 but did have decreased expression of ICOS. These results indicate that endogenous memory CD8 T cells infiltrate and proliferate in cardiac allografts in mice but do not express sufficient levels of functions to mediate overt graft injury and acute rejection.
