Acute antibody-mediated rejection of cardiac transplants. Under the direction of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, a multidisciplinary review of the cardiac biopsy grading system was undertaken in 2004, with task forces examining the areas of histopathology of rejection, clinical issues, and research. An important new area addressed by the Immunopathology Task Force sub-committee was the clinical and diagnostic criteria for antibody-mediated rejection. This article is a companion paper to the revised working formulation for the standardization of nomenclature in the diagnosis of heart rejection and reviews the published literature documenting the serologic and morphologic evidence that antibody-mediated rejection is clinically significant and associated with graft loss, accelerated transplant-associated coronary artery disease, and death. This article also provides a more in-depth analysis of antibody-mediated rejection developed by the Immunopathology Task Force for revision of the 1990 working formulation for the standardization of nomenclature in the diagnosis of heart rejection.
