Elective left pulmonary artery embolisation for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations secondary to cavopulmonary anastomoses not responsive to heart transplantation: a case report. A 10-year-old female with heterotaxy-asplenia and complex CHD developed pulmonary arteriovenous malformations with associated cyanosis after Fontan completion. She underwent orthotopic heart transplantation, but her pulmonary arteriovenous malformations persisted with progressive worsening cyanosis. Elective transcatheter left pulmonary artery embolisation was performed 2 years post-transplant, which successfully normalised her oxygen saturation without a significant increase in pulmonary artery pressure.
