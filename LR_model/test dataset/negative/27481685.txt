Applicability of cardiogoniometry as a non-invasive screening tool for the detection of graft vasculopathy in heart transplant recipients. Currently available diagnostic modalities for the detection of graft vasculopathy following orthotopic heart transplantation are subject to various restrictions. We hypothesized that cardiogoniometry, a novel non-invasive diagnostic tool for the detection of atherosclerotic coronary vessel disease, is applicable in the graft vasculopathy setting. Cardiogoniometric results were obtained during routine follow-up in 49 consecutive, unselected heart transplant recipients and then retrospectively correlated blindly by an independent reader to recent angiographic findings. Sensitivity of cardiogoniometry was 100%, specificity 62.3%, positive predictive value 68.75%, negative predictive value 100%, negative likelihood ratio 0 and positive likelihood ratio 2.888. Cardiogoniometry is potentially applicable as an easy-to-perform, non-invasive screening tool predominantly for the exclusion but also for the detection of graft vasculopathy in heart transplant recipients.
