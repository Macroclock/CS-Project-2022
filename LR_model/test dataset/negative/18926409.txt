Constrictive pericarditis after cardiac transplantation: a case report and literature review. We present a patient who was found to have constrictive pericarditis 6 months after cardiac allograft transplantation. The many invasive and non-invasive diagnostic procedures that were undertaken are reviewed, as is the gross pathology seen during surgery. In addition, the entity of constriction in the transplant patient is placed in context by an examination of the previous literature.
