Impact of a clinical pathway on acute kidney injury in patients undergoing heart transplant. To evaluate the impact of a clinical pathway on the incidence and severity of acute kidney injury in patients undergoing heart transplant. This was a 2.5-year retrospective evaluation using 3 years of historical controls within a cardiac intensive care unit in an academic children's hospital. Patients undergoing heart transplant between May 27, 2014, and April 5, 2017 (pre-pathway) and May 1, 2017, and November 30, 2019 (pathway) were included. The clinical pathway focused on supporting renal perfusion through hemodynamic management, avoiding or delaying nephrotoxic medications, and providing pharmacoprophylaxis against AKI. There were 57 consecutive patients included. There was an unadjusted 20% reduction in incidence of any acute kidney injury (p = .05) and a 17% reduction in Stage 2/3 acute kidney injury (p = .09). In multivariable adjusted analysis, avoidance of Stage 2/3 acute kidney injury was independently associated with the clinical pathway era (AOR -1.3 [95% CI -2.5 to -0.2]; p = .03), achieving a central venous pressure of or less than 12 mmHg (AOR -1.3 [95% CI -2.4 to -0.2]; p = .03) and mean arterial pressure above 60 mmHg (AOR -1.6 [95% CI -3.1 to -0.01]; p = .05) in the first 48 h post-transplant, and older age at transplant (AOR - 0.2 [95% CI -0.2 to -0.06]; p = .002). This report describes a renal protection clinical pathway associated with a reduction in perioperative acute kidney injury in patients undergoing heart transplant and highlights the importance of normalizing perioperative central venous pressure and mean arterial blood pressure to support optimal renal perfusion.
