Heart transplant in Jehovah's Witness patients: A case-control study. Heart transplantation (HTx) improves quality of life and survival in patients with advanced heart failure. Jehovah's Witnesses (JW) patients decline blood transfusion (including red cells, plasma and platelets) and are prohibited from heart transplantation at many centers. We report our experience with 20 consecutive JW patients with advanced heart failure who declined blood products referred to our center for HTx consideration. Of these, 7 were declined for transplant due to prior sternotomy, need for multi-organ transplant, or being too well. Of 13 JW patients accepted for heart transplant listing, 8 underwent HTx at our center. Compared to non-JW controls without prior cardiac surgery matched for age and listing status, JW HTx recipients had comparable incidence of primary graft dysfunction, rejection, allograft vasculopathy, and survival and hemoglobin up to 1 year. With appropriate selection, patients who are JW and decline blood products may successfully undergo heart transplantation. "Jehovah's Witness", 'bloodless transplantation', 'heart transplantation'
