[Improved cardiac function after inhalation of nitric oxide and tricuspid annuloplasty in dilated cardiomyopathy patient on left ventricular assist system]. A 17-year-old man with severe cardiac failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy was treated by medication. As he did not improve, he had indication for transplantation of the heart and was put on a ventricular assist system as a bridge until he could be transplanted. He also had severe tricuspid regurgitation and tricuspid annuloplasty was performed. Inhalation of nitric oxide was used to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance. Although cerebral infarction was present postoperatively, he is waiting for transplant without paralysis. The ventricular assist system proved to be useful therapy for serious cardiac failure due to terminal dilated cardiomyopathy.
