Postoperative management of heart transplantation patients. Heart transplant recipients are at risk for a number of post-transplantation complications such as graft dysfunction, rejection, and infection. The rates of many complications are decreasing over time, and prognosis is improving. However, these patients continue to experience significant morbidity and mortality. This review focuses on the optimal management of heart transplant recipients in the postoperative period, based on current knowledge. More information is needed about the best ways to predict, prevent, and treat primary graft dysfunction, right ventricular failure, and cellular and antibody-mediated rejection.
