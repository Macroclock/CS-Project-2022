The therapy of virus-associated epithelial tumors of the face and the lips in organ transplant recipients. The risk of developing malignant cutaneous neoplasms is increased after organ transplantation. We report three patients with malignant tumors of the epithelium of the facial skin and the lips after kidney and heart transplantation, respectively. They showed an aggressive course of the disease with more than five synchronous or metachronous basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas. Tissue samples were Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive by PCR. Using an in situ hybridization technique EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) was detected in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. The aggressive course was not alone controllable by surgical or radiological therapy. The systemic and topical application of cidofovir (Vistide) led to remarkable remissions, to a better confinement and operability of the tumors, and to a cessation of tumor pain. The photodynamic therapy represents another opportunity for managing superficial local recurrences and multiple tumors. In conclusion, the results of these case reports demonstrate that combined antiviral, photodynamic and surgical therapy may be used successfully to treat aggressive cutaneous malignancies in patients after organ transplantation.
