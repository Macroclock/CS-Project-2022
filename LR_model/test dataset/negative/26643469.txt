Malignancies After Heart Transplant. Along with graft vasculopathy, malignancies comprise a major complication after heart transplant, with a rate of occurrence of 39.1% in 10 years. Skin cancers and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder are more common in adults, whereas lymphoma is more often shown in children. A major cause of malignancies after heart transplant is the use of increased doses of prophylactics needed during immunosuppressive therapy. Data, however, are scarce regarding the association between a particular immunosuppressive drug and a posttransplant malignancy. Compared with the general population, recipients have a higher incidence of malignancies after heart transplant, with an early onset and more aggressive disease. Solid tumors known to occur in heart transplant recipients include lung cancer, bladder and prostate carcinoma, adenocarcinoma of the oral cavity, stomach cancer, and bowel cancer, although the incidence is rare. The risk factors for development of a malignancy after heart transplant are the same as for the nontransplant population.
