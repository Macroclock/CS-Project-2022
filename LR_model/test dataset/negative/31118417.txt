The K219T-Lamin mutation induces conduction defects through epigenetic inhibition of SCN5A in human cardiac laminopathy. Mutations in LMNA, which encodes the nuclear proteins Lamin A/C, can cause cardiomyopathy and conduction disorders. Here, we employ induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from human cells carrying heterozygous K219T mutation on LMNA to develop a disease model. Cardiomyocytes differentiated from these iPSCs, and which thus carry K219T-LMNA, have altered action potential, reduced peak sodium current and diminished conduction velocity. Moreover, they have significantly downregulated Na
