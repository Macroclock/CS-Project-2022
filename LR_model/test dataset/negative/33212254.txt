Distribution and resistance of pathogens in infected patients within 1 year after heart transplantation. Infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after heart transplantation (HT). However, there have been few data on clinical manifestation, distribution, and resistance of pathogens in the infected population of heart transplant recipients. We conducted a single-center retrospective study on patients who underwent HT in Wuhan Union Hospital from August 3, 2012 to July 30, 2016. Risk factors for infections that occur within 1 year after HT were investigated by multivariable logistic regression analysis. Among 299 patients, 147 patients (49.2%) confirmed infection. The most common site of infection was the respiratory system. A total of 259 pathogens were detected in 147 patients (49.2%) with infection after HT. In all, 64 multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria were detected in infected patients within 1 year after HT, the most common MDR bacteria were extended-spectrum Î²-lactamases (ESBL) Klebsiella pneumonia and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In the multivariable model, diabetes (OR 3.273 [95%CI, 1.748-6.130], and p < .001) and antibiotics treatment within 1 month before transplant (OR 1.860 [95%CI, 1.093-3.166], and p = .022) were significantly associated with infections within 1 year after HT. This study confirmed the high rate of infections within 1 year after HT. Diabetes and antibiotics treatment within 1 month before transplant were independent risk factors for infections within 1 year after HT.
