Sensitivity to perioperative ischemia/reperfusion injury in male and female donor myocardium. Many functions of the cardiovascular apparatus are affected by gender. The aim of our study was find out whether markers of cell death present in the donor myocardium differ in male and female hearts. The study involved 81 patients undergoing heart transplantation from September 2010 to January 2013. Patients were divided into two groups: male allograft (n=49), and female allograft (n=32). Two types of myocardial cell death were analyzed. High-sensitive cardiac troponin T as a necrosis marker and protein bcl-2, caspase 3 and TUNEL as apoptosis markers were measured. We observed a significantly higher level of high-sensitive cardiac troponin T after correcting for predicted ventricular mass in female donors before transplantation as well as in the female allograft group after transplantation throughout the monitored period (P=0.011). There were no differences in apoptosis markers (bcl-2, caspase 3, TUNEL) between male and female hearts before transplantation. Both genders showed a significant increase of TUNEL-positive myocytes one week after transplantation without differences between the groups. Moreover, there were no differences in caspase 3 and bcl-2 expression between the two groups. Our results demonstrated the presence of necrotic and apoptotic cell death in human heart allografts. High-sensitive cardiac troponin T adjusted for predicted ventricular mass as a marker of myocardial necrosis was higher in female donors, and this gender difference was even more pronounced after transplantation.
