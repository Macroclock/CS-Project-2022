Fatal human herpesvirus-6 infection after renal transplantation. Human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 infection is common after organ transplantation; however, most cases are associated with a mild clinical course. Donor-derived infection is rare, and there are no reports of HHV-6 infection in more than one recipient from a common donor. We describe two patients who developed severe, and in one case fatal, HHV-6 variant A infection after renal transplantation. Both patients presented with severe colitis followed by the development of liver dysfunction and cytopenia. Multiple specimens from both recipients were positive for HHV-6 polymerase chain reaction variant A. Serum and white cells from the donor were positive for HHV-6 DNA, suggesting a donor-derived infection in these patients. We report two cases of donor-derived HHV-6 infection from the same deceased donor, resulting in a fatal outcome in one patient. Treatment with valganciclovir was successfully instigated in one patient with a full recovery from the infection.
