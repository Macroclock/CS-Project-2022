Physical coronary arteriogenesis: a human "model" of collateral growth promotion. In patients with coronary artery disease, the size of myocardial infarction mainly determines the subsequent clinical outcome. Accordingly, it is the primary strategy to decrease cardiovascular mortality by minimizing infarct size. Promotion of collateral artery growth (arteriogenesis) is an appealing option of reducing infarct size. It has been demonstrated in experimental models that tangential fluid shear stress is the major trigger of arterial remodeling and, thus, of collateral growth. Lower-leg, high-pressure external counterpulsation triggered to occur during diastole induces a flow velocity signal and thus tangential endothelial shear stress in addition to the flow signal caused by cardiac stroke volume. We here present two cases of cardiac transplant recipients as human "models" of physical coronary arteriogenesis, providing an example of progressing and regressing clinical arteriogenesis, and review available evidence from clinical studies on other feasible forms of physical arteriogenesis.
