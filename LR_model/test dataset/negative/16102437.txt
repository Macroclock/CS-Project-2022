Inflammatory response and re-stenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention in heart transplant recipients and patients with native atherosclerosis. The clinical benefit of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in heart transplant recipients (HTRs) with coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) has been questioned. We investigated the degree of inflammatory reaction during PCI in CAV compared to patients with native atherosclerosis, and the possible relationship between PCI-induced inflammation and the degree of re-stenosis in these 2 patient groups. In 11 CAV patients and 10 patients with native atherosclerosis, blood samples were drawn before and 24 hours and 6 months after PCI, and analyzed with regard to hsCRP, MCP-1, components of complement activation, von Willebrand factor (vWf), soluble L-selectin and ICAM-1. Quantitative angiography was performed before and after PCI, and at 6-month follow-up. Baseline levels of hsCRP, vWf and MCP-1 were significantly elevated and levels of L-selectin and ICAM-1 and activation products of the alternative pathway of the complement system were decreased in CAV patients compared to those with native atherosclerosis. PCI induced significant increases of hsCRP in both groups as well as an increase in vWf in native atherosclerosis, whereas a decrease in L-selectin was observed in native atherosclerosis. Plasma levels of MCP-1 correlated with percent stenosis at follow-up in both groups, whereas a correlation between hsCRP and percent stenosis was evident only in patients with native atherosclerosis. There were no differences in rates of re-stenosis between the 2 groups. HTRs with CAV and patients with native atherosclerosis are characterized by different profiles of immune activation and respond differently to PCI. Nevertheless, an inappropriate inflammatory reactivity may predispose to re-stenosis after PCI in both groups of patients, with pre-procedural inflammation being of particular importance in CAV.
