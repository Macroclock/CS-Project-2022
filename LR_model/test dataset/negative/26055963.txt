The Value of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance in Heart Transplant Patients. Heart transplant patients present a unique set of anatomical and pathophysiological considerations. Patients often present non-specifically, requiring a low index for further investigation. Accurate assessment with standard imaging modalities can be difficult, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is becoming an increasingly useful modality in the assessment of heart transplant patients. This review describes the anatomy of the transplanted heart and typical CMR appearances and discusses the role of CMR in heart transplant disease.
