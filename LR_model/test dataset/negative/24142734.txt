Left ventricular systolic strain of the cardiac allograft evaluated with three-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. Three-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography was employed to evaluate the changes of left ventricular systolic strain in 23 heart transplant recipients at 1st, 3rd, 6th and 12th month after heart transplantation, and 23 healthy subjects served as controls. The three-dimensional full-volume echocardiographic images of left ventricle were recorded and then were analyzed using EchoPAC software. The strain curves and peak systolic strain values for each segment and overall left ventricular wall were obtained. Left ventricular global peak longitudinal strain (GPSL), global peak radial strain (GPSR), global peak circumferential strain (GPSC) and global peak area strain (GPSA) were measured and then statistically analyzed. There were no significant differences in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and cardiac output (CO) between heart transplant recipients and controls. The GPSL in heart transplant recipients at 1st month after surgery was significantly lower than that in controls, but close to the normal value at 3rd month after surgery and later. The GPSC, GPSA and GPSR were significantly lower in heart transplant recipients at 1st, 3rd, 6th and 12th month after surgery than those in controls. It is suggested that three-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography can be used for monitoring changes of left ventricular systolic strains and evaluating left ventricular systolic function in cardiac allograft.
