The apo A-I gene promoter region polymorphism determines the severity of hyperlipidemia after heart transplantation. To study whether the Apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) promoter region gene polymorphism produces changes in the lipid profile of heart transplant recipients. One hundred and three heart transplant recipients (93 men and 10 women, with a mean age of 47 +/- 13 yr) receiving triple immunosuppressive therapy were submitted to a genetic study of the apo A-I gene promoter region. Anthropometric and analytical data, including lipid profile, arterial blood pressure, were collected prior to transplantation and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after transplantation. Sixty-three subjects had the GG genotype and 40 the GA genotype. Carriers of the GA genotype had higher triglyceride levels at 6 months and 2 yr (2.50 +/- 1.20 versus 1.93 +/- 0.98 mmol/L and 2.46 +/- 1.58 versus 1.60 +/- 0.68 mmol/L, respectively, p < 0.001), and a greater rise in LDL-cholesterol at 1 yr than the GG subjects (4.57 +/- 1.16 versus 4.16 +/- 1.18 mmol/L, p < 0.05). Multiple regression analyses showed that genetic variants at the apo A-I promoter region are responsible for 11% of the variability in triglyceride levels at 6 months (p = 0.005). The GA genotype of the apo A-I promoter region produces a greater rise in plasma triglyceride and LDL-cholesterol levels in heart transplant patients.
