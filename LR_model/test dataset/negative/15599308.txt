Reduction of consumptive coagulopathy using porcine cytomegalovirus-free cardiac porcine grafts in pig-to-primate xenotransplantation. Xenotransplantation using pigs as the source species for organs carries a potential risk for transmission and activation of porcine herpesviruses. Activation of porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV) in pig-to-baboon xenotransplantation is associated with xenograft injury and possibly an increased incidence of consumptive coagulopathy (CC). To further investigate the role of PCMV activation in the occurrence of CC, a strategy to exclude PCMV from the donor was developed. To exclude PCMV, piglets were early-weaned and raised separated from other swine. These piglets were used as donors in an experimental protocol of pig-to-baboon heart xenotransplantation. Early weaning of piglets was successful in excluding PCMV. Use of PCMV-free cardiac porcine xenografts in baboons resulted in prolonged graft survival and prevented consumptive coagulopathy in all recipients. The use of PCMV-free cardiac grafts is beneficial in reducing the direct effects of PCMV activation in the graft (tissue damage) and the indirect effects of PCMV activation in the recipient (consumptive coagulopathy).
