Heart Transplantation in the Short Term After Chemotherapy. Anthracycline antibiotics are an effective therapy for a variety of neoplastic diseases. Dilated cardiomyopathy is a known risk of their use. Because of the risk of new or recurrent neoplasm with immunosuppression transplantation is often delayed. Our patient developed early cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure 3 months after completion of chemotherapy. Given the severity of her cardiac symptoms the decision was made to proceed with heart transplantation in the short term after completion of her chemotherapy. We report the success to 1 year of this decision and discuss the implications of her genetic and oncologic diagnoses in this clinical scenario.
