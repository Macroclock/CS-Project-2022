Identification of device malfunction in patients supported with the HeartMate XVE left ventricular assist system. Predicting end-of-life for left ventricular assist devices is important to determine timing of device removal. A retrospective analysis was performed on 46 patients undergoing implantation of the latest HeartMate XVE from July 1, 2003, through March 31, 2006. Devices were assessed by analysis of motor current waveforms and quantification of the titanium or copper particles within dust localized to the driveline vent filter by optical, polarized light, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. Assessments were performed monthly for patients supported > or =330 days or for unexpected device alarms. Thirty-one (67%) patients were supported for <330 days and 15 (33%) were supported for > or =330 days. No malfunctions occurred in patients supported <330 days. For patients supported > or =330 days, five had abnormal current waveforms or copper and titanium dust localized to the vent filter. One underwent urgent transplantation, three underwent device replacement (one death; two ongoing), and one is with ongoing support. Of the remaining 10 patients, seven underwent transplantation; two remain on device; and one died while on left ventricular assist device support. There were no unexpected device failures. Bearing wear of the HeartMate XVE is predictable by analysis of current waveforms or titanium and copper dust within the vent filter.
