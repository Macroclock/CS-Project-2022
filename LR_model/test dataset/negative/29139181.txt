Direct antiviral treatment of chronic hepatitis C in heart transplant recipients. Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) are a safe and effective treatment for chronic hepatitis C (CHC). This may be particularly valuable for patients with severe comorbidities or baseline conditions, including non-liver solid organ transplant. We report cases of two heart transplant recipients with CHC treated with DAAs (sofosbuvir and daclatasvir) achieving sustained virological response. Treatment was well tolerated and no relevant side effects were observed. The drug-drug interactions and graft function were carefully monitored.
