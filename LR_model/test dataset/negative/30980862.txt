Angiotensin II type I receptor antibodies in thoracic transplantation. Angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) is a critical player in regulating vasoconstriction, blood pressure, sodium retention. Even though AT1R has limited polymorphism, AT1R antibodies have been detected in several diseases. The role of AT1R antibodies in transplantation is first reported in kidney transplant, and then identified in heart and lung transplants. Mechanical circulatory support devices (MCS) can also stimulate production of AT1R antibodies. AT1R antibodies may negatively impact graft or patient survival through mechanisms independent of the classical complement activation.
