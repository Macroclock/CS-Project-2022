Volumetric intravascular ultrasound assessment of mechanisms and results of stent expansion in heart transplant patients. Percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement for the treatment of patients with cardiac allograft vasculopathy is common, but data regarding stent behavior in this setting is lacking. We investigated mechanisms and potential differences in stent expansion among transplant patients vs. patients with native coronary artery atherosclerotic disease ("controls"). We compared pre- and poststent intravascular ultrasound in 12 transplant patients (17 lesions) and 33 control patients (34 lesions) matched according to age (60.1 Â± 9.2 years), diabetes mellitus, and lesion location. Planar and volumetric analysis was conducted for every 1 mm at the lesion site as well as the first 5 mm proximal and distal to the stent edge. Focal stent expansion was defined as minimum stent area (MSA) divided by mean reference lumen area. Diffuse stent expansion was defined as mean stent area divided by mean reference lumen area. Transplant patients had more plaque than "controls" prestenting, but similar MSA and focal and diffuse stent expansion afterwards. The increase in mean lumen area correlated with the increase in mean vessel area in both groups, transplant (R = 0.64, P = 0.008) and controls (R = 0.70, P < 0.0001), but correlated inversely with changes in mean plaque area only in the transplant group (R = 0.55, P = 0.027). There were no differences in calcification between the two groups and no axial plaque distribution from the lesion into the reference segments in either group. The mechanism of stent expansion in transplant vasculopathy appears to be similar to de novo atherosclerosis-i.e., mainly vessel expansion to achieve similar acute results.
