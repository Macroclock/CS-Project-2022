Successful use of factor VIIa to control life-threatening post-operative haemorrhage in a patient on extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. Recombinant Factor VII (Novoseven) is gaining recognition as an established treatment option for post-cardiac surgery bleeding. However, little information is available on its use in patients being maintained on Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) support, particularly in the adult population. We present the first case of the successful use of Factor VIIa to control bleeding in an adult patient on ECMO post cardiac surgery.
