Successful treatment of hemodynamic compromise caused by antibody-mediated and cellular rejection in a recipient 12 years after heart transplantation. Heart transplantation (HTx) is an established therapy for stage D heart failure due to recent advances in immunosuppressive regimens. However, antibody-mediated rejection remains an unsolved problem because of its refractoriness to standard immunosuppressive therapy with high mortality and graft loss. We experienced a 16-year old patient with hemodynamic compromise caused by both cellular and antibody-mediated rejection 12 years after HTx. The rejection was refractory to repeated steroid pulse treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin administration, and intensifying immunosuppression including addition of everolimus. Eventually, she was successfully treated with repeated plasma exchange accompanied by a single administration of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab.
