Pediatric Heart Transplantation With Lecompte Maneuver Owing to Extremely Oversized Donor Allograft. The techniques and outcomes of heart transplantation in the pediatric population continue to improve over the years, although the supply of organs remains limited. Donor-to-recipient size matching is critical, especially in neonates and small infants. We present a novel strategy for heart transplantation that includes the Lecompte maneuver because of the features of the donor allograft available in a 8-month-old patient with a cardiac fibroma. We discuss the basis principles for extending the indication of this procedure to exceptional transplantation scenarios and describe the results at long-term follow-up.
