T-cell-mediated rejection of vascularized xenografts in the absence of induced anti-donor antibody response. T cells are considered to play a major indirect role in the pathogenesis of xenograft vascular rejection, by promoting the induction of anti-donor antibodies that trigger complement- and antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. However, how vigorous the T cell xenoresponse is in vivo, and whether, besides their helper function, T cells are capable of directly affecting the graft is still unclear. We have previously shown that cyclosporine A (CsA) withdrawal in accommodated cardiac xenograft recipient allows for a rapid and dense T-cell infiltration, concomitant to an acute graft rejection. In this paper we further characterize the role of T cells in this rejection process and we demonstrate that adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells in irradiated recipients of long-term cardiac xenografts is sufficient to trigger acute rejection, in the absence of any detectable induced anti-hamster antibody response. Therefore, our data suggest that unusually strong T-cell response will be another major barrier to xenotransplantation, even if antibody-mediated vascular rejection is controlled.
