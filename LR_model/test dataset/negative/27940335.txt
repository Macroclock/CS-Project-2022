Comparison Between the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire and New York Heart Association in Assessing Functional Capacity and Clinical Outcomes. The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) has emerged as a patient-centered heart failure-specific health status measure. It currently lacks routine and widespread use in clinical practice and trials. The purpose of this study was to examine the correlation between KCCQ and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) parameters and clinical outcomes, compared with the New York Heart Association functional classification (NYHA). We performed a single-centered observational analysis of 432 patients who presented to the Heart Failure Department, completed the KCCQ, and underwent CPET. The 1-year clinical outcome assessed was a composite of mortality, heart failure hospitalization, and need for heart transplantation or left ventricular assist device. In the KCCQ, the physical limitation domain had a correlation with peak VO KCCQ and NYHA provide similar assessment of functional capacity. KCCQ predicts 1-year clinical outcomes, providing incremental value over NYHA. These findings support its routine use in clinical care, as well as its potential to serve as a measure in clinical trials. 'Heart failure', 'KCCQ', 'NYHA', 'functional capacity', 'peak VO(2)'
