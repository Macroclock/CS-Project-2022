Impact on renal function of the use of sirolimus in cardiac transplantation. During the last few years sirolimus has been introduced as an alternative to preserve renal function in transplant recipients receiving calcineurin inhibitors. We reviewed our results on the use of sirolimus in cardiac transplant recipients. Twenty-seven patients with an average age of 63 years received sirolimus. The average time after transplantation was 73.4 +/- 58.9 months and the average follow-up was 31.7 +/- 18.01 months. Sirolimus was prescribed in 37% of cases due to chronic renal failure (CRF), 14.8% because of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), 11.1% for tumors, 22.2% de novo, 7.4% for CRF and tumor, and 7.4% for CRF and CAV. Among the patients with CRF (n = 14), there were 5 (35%) on dialysis at the moment of starting the treatment and 1 was retired from dialysis. The other 4 (28.5%) patients had to be treated with dialysis after starting the treatment. In all, 42.8% of the patients with nephropathy maintained stable renal function or improved. Among the 17 (63%) patients who did not require dialysis, there was no significant change in renal function after 6 months or 1, 2, and 3 years follow-up. The use of sirolimus in cardiac transplantation maintains stable renal function in the majority of patients in the medium term.
