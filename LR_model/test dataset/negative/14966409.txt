Mouse-heart grafts expressing an incompatible carbohydrate antigen. II. Transition from accommodation to tolerance. Immune response to incompatible ABO antigens on allografts may result in rejection, accommodation, or immune tolerance. Our objective has been to develop a model for studying these three types of immune response to incompatible carbohydrate antigen in alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase knockout (KO) mice. KO mice lack the alpha-gal epitope and can produce the anti-Gal antibody against it after immunization with pig kidney membranes (PKM) that express this epitope. KO mice were transplanted with syngeneic wild-type (WT) heart expressing alpha-gal epitopes. Subsequently, the mice were lethally irradiated and received lymphocytes including memory anti-Gal B cells from PKM immunized KO mice. Immune response to incompatible alpha-gal epitopes on the graft was determined by transplanted-heart function and by production of anti-Gal after PKM immunizations. Anti-Gal B cells exposed for 1 to 2 weeks to alpha-gal epitopes of WT hearts differentiate into cells producing noncytolytic accommodating antibodies. Exposure for longer periods (2-4 weeks) induces a transition from accommodation into tolerance, indicated by the inability of mice to produce anti-Gal antibodies despite repeated PKM immunizations. WT hearts in accommodating and in tolerized mice continue to function for months. In the absence of T-cell help, anticarbohydrate B cells exposed to incompatible carbohydrate antigens of transplanted organs differentiate first into cells capable of producing accommodating antibodies, but, after prolonged exposure, these B cells gradually become tolerized. These findings suggest that prolonged T-cell suppression in recipients of ABO-incompatible allografts may result in a similar induction of tolerance to incompatible blood-group antigens.
