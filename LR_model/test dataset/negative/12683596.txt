Modification of bicaval anastomosis: an alternative technique for orthotopic cardiac transplantation. We describe an alternative technique for orthotopic cardiac transplantation (OCT), which we use to combine the advantages of the conventional technique (Lower and Shumway) and the bicaval anastomosis. The modified technique was utilized in 31 consecutive patients undergoing heart transplantation by one surgeon in our hospital since 1998.
