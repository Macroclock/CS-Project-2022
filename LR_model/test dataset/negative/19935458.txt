Adiponectin inhibits allograft rejection in murine cardiac transplantation. Low levels of plasma adiponectin, an adipocytokine that possesses anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic properties, frequently observed among obese subjects correlate with higher prevalence of several cardiovascular diseases. This study investigated whether adiponectin modulates allograft rejection in major histocompatibility complex class II-mismatched cardiac transplants. We heterotopically transplanted Bm12 allografts into adiponectin-deficient (APN-/-, C57BL/6 background) or wild-type (APN+/+) mice. Some APN-/- mice received adiponectin reconstitution by adenovirus. Histologic analyses assessed allograft rejection, and real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction evaluated the genes for cytokines/chemokines associated with the immune and inflammatory responses. In addition, we tested the effect of adiponectin on proliferation and cytokine/chemokine production in mouse T lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3 antibodies. Allografts transplanted to APN-/- mice showed severe acute rejection relative to transplants in APN+/+ hosts accompanied by increased accumulation of CD4- and CD8-positive T lymphocytes and Mac3-positive macrophages. Adiponectin provision by adenovirus in APN-/- mice reversed these exacerbated responses to allografting. The rejected allografts in APN-/- mice contained significantly higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and regulated on activation normal t expressed and presumably secreted. Moreover, adiponectin significantly suppressed proliferation and production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, regulated on activation normal t expressed and presumably secreted, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and interferon-gamma inducible protein-10 in mouse T lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3 antibodies. These observations provide new mechanistic insight into immunoregulation in allograft recipients relative to obesity, an increasingly prevalent risk factor. Adiponectin may offer a new therapeutic target for allograft rejection after cardiac transplantation.
