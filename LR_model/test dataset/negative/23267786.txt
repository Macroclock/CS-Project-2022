The soluble tachyzoite antigen of Toxoplasma gondii has a protective effect on mouse allografts. Infection with some types of parasites can significantly prolong allograft survival in mice. It is unknown whether the soluble tachyzoite antigen (STAg) from Toxoplasma gondii has the same effect and by what mechanism it acts. A mouse model of cardiac and skin allograft transplantation was established between BALB/c (H-2(d)) and C57BL/6(H-2(b)) mice. T gondii STAg was prepared, and 5 μg was administered subcutaneously to recipient mice 4 days before transplantation. The graft status was checked daily, and histologic and immunohistochemical assays were used to evaluate rejection. The serum cytokine levels from the recipient mice were analyzed by Luminex. The administration of 5 μg STAg 4 days before transplantation significantly prolonged the survival time of the heart and skin allografts to 85.17 ± 14.06 and 24.17 ± 2.32 days, respectively. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes were markedly reduced in the allografts at day 7 posttransplantation. Notably, interleukin (IL)-12, IL-2, and IL-17 levels were significantly reduced in the serum of mice treated with STAg compared with untreated mice 7 days after transplantation. In contrast, the levels of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 were elevated. A single administration of STAg before transplantation can significantly prolong the allograft survival time, which is accompanied by impaired lymphocyte infiltration and a reduced Th1 response.
