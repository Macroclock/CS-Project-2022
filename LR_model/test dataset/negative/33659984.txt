Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in a patient with left ventricular assist device. Left ventricular assist devices provide circulatory support to heart failure patients while awaiting a suitable donor heart. However, with their increased duration of therapy, complications are seen frequently. Although coagulation disorders (bleeding and thrombosis) are the most common complications, infection is also a major complication associated with significant morbidity. We report a case of a 53-year-old male with a left ventricular assist device who presented with driveline infection. He subsequently developed pancytopenia and was diagnosed with haemophagocytosis. Immediate treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone was started. His blood cell count returned to normal levels and the patient became eligible for heart transplantation again. Our case represents the rare occurrence of haemophagocytosis in a patient, which, if unnoticed, could lead to fatal consequences.
