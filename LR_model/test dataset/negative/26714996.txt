Clinical Issues and Controversies in Heart Failure and Transplantation. Heart failure is a common problem among children admitted in the intensive care unit and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. As such, the 2014 meeting of the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society included a session on Clinical Controversies in Heart Failure and Transplantation. This review contains the summaries of the podium presentations of this session and will cover some of the challenging aspects of caring for these patients including medical and mechanical support, fluid overload states, high-risk populations including those after heart transplantation, and end-of-life considerations.
