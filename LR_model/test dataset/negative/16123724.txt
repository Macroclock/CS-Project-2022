Effect of adenovirus-mediated transfer of the CTLA4IG gene in hamster-to-rat xenotransplantation. Costimulatory molecules such as CD28 and B7 are essential for T cell activation, as well as playing a role in the T cell receptor and major histocompatibility complex pathway. It is well known that rejection in allotransplantation is diminished by treatment with CTLA4Ig, but whether a similar effect occurs in xenotransplantation remains to be determined. In this study, we investigated whether adenovirus-mediated gene transfer with CTLA4Ig cDNA by intravenous injection to the recipient is effective in suppression in hamster-to-rat cardiac xenotransplantation. With CTLA4Ig gene transfer, the duration of gene expression was clearly prolonged, based on reduced production of antiadenovirus antibody and shrinkage of the spleen. The survival of cardiac xenografts was significantly prolonged with CTLA4Ig gene transfer compared to the control graft, and survival with combination use of FK506 and CTLA4Ig gene transfer in xenotransplantation was also significantly prolonged compared to that with CTLA4Ig gene transfer alone. Cessation of the cardiac graft in the combination treatment occurred in parallel with the elevation of antihamster IgM antibodies in rat sera. These results suggest that adenovirus-mediated CTLA4Ig gene transfer is effective for immunosuppression in hamster-to-rat xenotransplantation.
