Orthotopic heart transplant: a therapeutic option for unresectable cardiac fibroma in infants. Primary cardiac tumors are rare lesions in childhood, with the two most common being rhabdomyoma and fibroma. We report two infants who successfully underwent orthotopic heart transplant for massive interventricular septal cardiac fibromas. For unresectable infantile cardiac fibroma, orthotopic heart transplant may be considered a therapeutic option.
