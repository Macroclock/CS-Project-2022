Successful use of bivalirudin for cardiac transplantation in a child with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Bivalirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, has recently emerged as a promising option for anti-coagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass in patients who cannot receive heparin. There is limited experience with the use of bivalirudin in children. We present the case of a child with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HIT Type II) who underwent successful orthotopic cardiac transplantation using bivalirudin as the primary anti-coagulant for cardiopulmonary bypass.
