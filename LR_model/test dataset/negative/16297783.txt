Freedom from graft vessel disease in heart and combined heart- and kidney-transplanted patients treated with tacrolimus-based immunosuppression. In end-stage cardiomyopathy where concomitant chronic renal failure is a contraindication for cardiac transplantation (HTx), simultaneous heart and kidney transplantation (HKTx) may be the only feasible therapeutic option. Due to the increased donor shortage, the clinical outcome of combined HKTx patients on tacrolimus-based immunosuppression was assessed and compared with a group of HTx patients. Three hundred forty-nine HTxs, including 13 (4%) combined HKTxs, were performed since 1995. Two hundred twenty-one HTx and all HKTx recipients received tacrolimus-based immunosuppression. Acute rejection episodes (AREs), infections, renal function and clinical outcome were evaluated. Pre-operative renal diagnoses for HKTx patients included cystic nephropathy (n = 4), glomerulonephritis (n = 4), cytostatica-induced nephropathy (n = 1), chronic rejection after renal transplant (n = 1), reflux nephropathy (n = 2) and chronic calcineurin-inhibitor -induced nephropathy after HTx (n = 1). Twelve patients (92%) were on hemodialysis pre-operatively, 1 underwent implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) before HKTx. After 4.7 +/- 2 years, 92% of HKTx compared with 85% of HTx patients had survived (p = 0.42). Acute cardiac rejection episodes were more frequent in HTx than in HKTx patients (0.04 +/- 0.09 vs 0.02 +/- 0.04 ARE/100 patient-days; p = 0.07). Incidence of infection was comparable (0.3 +/- 0.2 vs 0.5 +/- 0.4 infection/100 patient-days). Freedom from transplant vasculopathy was 100% in the HKTx group compared with 71% in the HTx group after 4 years (p = 0.04). Tacrolimus-based immunosuppression yields promising long-term results in HKTx and HTx. The incidence of transplant vasculopathy seems to be lower after HKTx than after HTx. If these results are secondary to a protective effect of tacrolimus-induced tolerance or of tolerance-associated co-transplantation they will need to be investigated in prospective multicenter trials.
