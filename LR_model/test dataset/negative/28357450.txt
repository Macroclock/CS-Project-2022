An Alternative Strategy for Bridge-to-Transplant/Recovery in Small Children with Dilated Cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy in children still has a poor prognosis with high rates of mortality and cardiac transplantation (resp. around 20 and 25%). Awaiting transplantation or possible recovery, these pediatric patients are mechanically supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or a paracorporeal ventricular assist device, both resulting in higher survival rates but also entailing considerable risks of infection, thrombosis, or bleeding. A new indication for an old technique, i.e., pulmonary artery banding, presents itself as an interesting alternative to mechanical circulatory support in selected infants and small children with dilated LV cardiomyopathy and preserved RV function. Here we present a brief review of literature and report on two patients in whom PAB has been successfully implemented as either bridge-to-recovery or bridge-to-transplant.
