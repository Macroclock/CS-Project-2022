Use of Impella 5L for acute allograft rejection postcardiac transplant. The contribution of acute allograft rejection to posttransplant mortality has decreased over time primarily due to improvements in maintenance immunosuppression and in the diagnosis and treatment of rejection. Nevertheless, acute heart allograft rejection remains an important clinical problem.2 In the setting of an acute allograft rejection, mechanical circulatory support has been provided by a variety of devices, ranging from intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABP) to extracorporeal membrane oxygenators (ECMO), left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) and biventricular assist devices (BIVADs).2 We present a 45-year-old patient with cardiogenic shock secondary to acute allograft rejection after orthotopic heart transplantation. Patient continued to have poor hemodynamics and low cardiac output despite being on high doses of inotropes and an aggressive immunosuppression. Hence, a decision was made to support the hemodynamics with an Impella LP 5.0 (Abiomed Inc, Danvers, MA) left ventricular assist device (LVAD).
