Development and validation of a combined enzymatic-digestion/mass spectrometry assay for Tacrolimus quantitation in cardiac biopsies. Recent studies report strategies for analysing immunosuppressive drugs in brain, liver and renal tissue, mostly in animals: we developed and validated a two steps combined enzymatic digestion/mass spectrometry assay to quantify Tacrolimus (TAC) in heart biopsies. Our aims were to avoid sample loss and sample contamination during the laboratory preparation, and to limit matrix effects in the electrospray ionization source (ESI) of the mass spectrometer. Enzymatic tissue digestion followed by a liquid-liquid drug extraction in the same vial of reaction allowed us to reach both our aims. The assay was assessed for selectivity, matrix effect, linearity, Lower Limit of Quantification (LLOQ) and Detection (LOD), accuracy and precision, according to the "Guideline on Bioanalytical Method Validation (EMA).
