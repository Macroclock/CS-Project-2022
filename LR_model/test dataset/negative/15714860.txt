[The best of cardiac failure in 2004]. Regarding cardiac failure, the year 2004 was notable for the dissemination of indications for the use of medical devices in heart failure: indications for cardioversion with the long awaited publication of the COMPANION study, advancement of the concept of intra-ventricular asynchronism, and studies of defibrillators in non-ischaemic cardiac failure (COMPANION, DEFINITE, SCD-HeFT, TOVA). Furthermore, pragmatic clinical studies allowed refinement of the uses of BNP (diagnostic and prognostic), underlining the importance of renal function and its progression during hospitalisation, and the risks of using strong, modern therapy in populations without "ad hoc" surveillance which do not correspond with study populations (aldactone in Canada). Just as in coronary patients, it appears to be important to commence full medical treatment prior to hospital discharge, because treatment is rarely changed thereafter. The management of seriously ill patients is evolving with several therapeutic advances: the methods of selecting patients for heart transplants have changed, with the advancement of opportunities for circulatory assistance. Attention has also been turned to the significant group, still poorly understood, of patients with diastolic heart failure, for whom diagnostic methods have been defined, as well as their clinical characteristics. Lastly the medication studies: new drugs in acute cardiac failure (preliminary results for vasopressin antagonists), wider indications for betablockers in elderly subjects (SENIORS), and advances in cellular cardiomyoplasty (using haemopoietic stem cells especially this year). It has been a fruitful year, difficult to summarise in a few lines, or even several pages....
