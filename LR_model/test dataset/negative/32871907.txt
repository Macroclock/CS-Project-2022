Primary central nervous system lymphoma after heart transplantation: A case report and literature review. The heart transplantation is the most important treatment for patients with end-stage severe heart disease who failed to conventional therapy. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder is the second most common malignancy in heart transplant recipients. However, primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) after heart transplantation is an extremely rare condition. This report described a 53-year-old male who was diagnosed as PCNSL 17 months after heart transplantation. The patient was admitted to the local hospital presenting with dizziness, headache, and reduced left-sided power and sensation for 1 week. He had a medical history of heart transplantation because of the dilated cardiomyopathy 17 months ago and had a 17-month history of immunosuppressive therapy with tacrolimus. A computed tomography scan of the brain revealed a bulky mass in the right temporal lobe. The emergency intracranial mass resection and cerebral decompression were performed in our hospital. The histopathology of the brain lesions showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. A further FDG positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan of the whole body showed no significantly increased metabolic activity in other regions. The final diagnosis of this patient was PCNSL after heart transplantation. Given the poor health condition, with the patient's consent, the whole brain radiotherapy was performed with supportive care. The disease deteriorated rapidly during the period of receiving radiotherapy, and he died within 2 months from the diagnosis. PCNSL after heart transplantation is an extremely rare phenomenon with extremely poor prognosis. We should pay close attention to the heart recipients, especially when the patients present with neurological symptoms and signs. The available treatment options for PCNS-post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder include the reduction of immunosuppressive drugs, immune-chemotherapy, operation, radiotherapy. However, individual treatments for heart transplant recipients with PCNSL should be based on the performance status and tolerance to treatment, combined with the doctor's experience and supportive care.
