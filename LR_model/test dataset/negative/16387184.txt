A new cardiac concordant xenotransplantation model. A simplified method of heterotopic abdominal cardiac xenotransplantation and its technique problems are described. Hamster-to-rat cardiac xenotransplantation was performed by means of "sleeve and cuff" method. The left common carotid artery of the donor heart was anastomosed to the left renal artery of the recipient with a "sleeve" anastomosis, and the "cuffed" right pulmonary artery was anastamosed to the left renal vein of the rat. The viability of the donor heart was examined daily by palpating the left abdominal wall of the rat. Among 105 rats that underwent heterotopic cardiac xenotransplantation, 95 were completed successfully. The xenograft survived for 3 to 4 days after the procedure suffering typical acute vascular rejection. A useful, easy model to investigate the mechanisms of concordant xenotransplantation was established.
