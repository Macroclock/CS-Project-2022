CYP3A-status is associated with blood concentration and dose-requirement of tacrolimus in heart transplant recipients. High inter-individual variability in tacrolimus clearance is attributed to genetic polymorphisms of CYP3A enzymes. However, due to CYP3A phenoconversion induced by non-genetic factors, continuous changes in tacrolimus-metabolizing capacity entail frequent dose-refinement for optimal immunosuppression. In heart transplant recipients, the contribution of patients' CYP3A-status (CYP3A5 genotype and CYP3A4 expression) to tacrolimus blood concentration and dose-requirement was evaluated in the early and late post-operative period. In low CYP3A4 expressers carrying CYP3A5*3/*3, the dose-corrected tacrolimus level was significantly higher than in normal CYP3A4 expressers or in those with CYP3A5*1. Modification of the initial tacrolimus dose was required for all patients: dose reduction by 20% for low CYP3A4 expressers, a 40% increase for normal expressers and a 2.4-fold increase for CYP3A5*1 carriers. The perioperative high-dose corticosteroid therapy was assumed to ameliorate the low initial tacrolimus-metabolizing capacity during the first month. The fluctuation of CYP3A4 expression and tacrolimus blood concentration (C
