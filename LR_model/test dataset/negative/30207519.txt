Conventional culture method and qPCR using 16S rDNA for tissue bank: a comparison using a model of cardiac tissue contamination. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using 16S rDNA is an alternative to conventional culture-based tests. The aim of this study was to compare the conventional culture method with qPCR using 16S rDNA in a model of cardiac tissue contamination. Samples of cardiac tissue for artificial contamination with Escherichia coli and control samples were submitted for DNA extraction, which was conducted by selective and alkaline lysis and purification steps. A standard curve for 16S rDNA was constructed to determine the efficiency and analytical sensitivity of the assay in concentrations from 10 '16S rDNA', 'cardiovascular tissues', 'conventional culture', 'real-time PCR', 'tissue bank'
