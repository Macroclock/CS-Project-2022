Catheter ablation of recipient right ventricular tachycardia after heterotopic heart transplantation. Ventricular tachycardia after heart transplantation. A case is reported of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in a 62-year-old male after heterotopic heart transplantation, who occasionally had attacks of palpitation. Surface electrocardiogram suggested VT arising from the recipient heart. Intracardiac electrograms and entrainment mapping confirmed macroreentrant VT located in the recipient right ventricle. Radiofrequency ablation using an electroanatomical mapping system (CARTO, Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA) successfully eliminated VT.
