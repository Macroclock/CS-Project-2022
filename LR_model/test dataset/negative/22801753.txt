How to demonstrate the reversibility of end-organ function before implantation of left ventricular assist device in INTERMACS profile 2 patients? For the time being, in Japan, two recently approved implantable ventricular assist devices (VADs) are indicated only when a patient has been listed for heart transplantation or approved to be eligible for heart transplantation by in-hospital committee. The reversibility of end-organ dysfunction must be expected before VAD implantation, but it is often hard to prove during worsening clinical status. We report two patients whose end-organ dysfunction had been eventually demonstrated to be reversible by invasive procedures such as transluminal liver biopsy or transient insertion of intra-aortic balloon pumping.
