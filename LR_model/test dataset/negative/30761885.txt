Evaluation of myocardial dispersion of repolarization in patients with heart transplantation The number of patients with heart transplantation has dramatically increased in the last decade. Considerable studies have suggested that the interval from the peak to the end of the electrocardiographic T wave (Tp-e) may correspond to the transmural dispersion of repolarization and increased Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio are associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias. We analyzed the dispersion of myocardial repolarization using electrocardiographic Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QTc ratio in patients with heart transplantation. This observational study included 38 patients (12 female and 26 male) with heart transplantation and 38 well-matched controls.  From electrocardiograms, Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QTc ratio were calculated and compared between the 2 groups. Noninvasive arrhythmia indicators including Tp-e interval (84.63 ± 14.17 ms vs 71.82 ± 7.47 ms, P < 0.001), Tp-e/QTc ratio (0.19 ± 0.04 vs 0.16 ± 0.02, P < 0.001) and QTc interval except QT interval were significantly higher in transplanted hearts compared to normal hearts. Patients with heart transplantation have increased myocardial dispersion of repolarization. 'Tp-e/QTc ratio', 'heart transplantation', 'myocardial dispersion of repolarization'
