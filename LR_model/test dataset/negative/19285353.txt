Prognostic value of CA125 in advanced heart failure patients. Serum levels of CA125 are often high in advanced heart failure (AHF) patients. To determine the predictive value of CA125 in forecasting the occurrence of death or cardiac transplantation in an AHF population. 88 AHF patients referred for heart transplantation were divided into 2 groups based on CA125 levels: normal (CA125<38 U/mL) and elevated (> or = 38 U/mL). Events (death or heart transplant) were monitored over a period of 13+/-7 months after CA125 determination. Patients with elevated CA125 (n=65) had significantly lower blood pressure, body mass index, serum sodium and peak exercise oxygen consumption, while B-type natriuretic peptide levels were significantly higher. The combined primary endpoint (death or heart transplant) rate was 39.4% and 62.3% in normal and elevated CA125 groups, respectively (p=0.029). Multivariate regression analysis showed that CA125 and sodium levels were the only independent predictors of the combined endpoint. In AHF patients, plasma CA125 was an effective prognostic marker. Its determination may contribute to better risk stratification in this population.
