High prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux in children after lung transplantation. Bronchiolitis obliterans and its clinical correlate bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality following lung transplantation. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may be a contributing factor for the development of BOS. Since 2002, all recipients of lung and heart-lung transplantation at our institution have been routinely investigated for GERD. In this observational study, we report on the prevalence of GERD in this population, including all pediatric patients undergoing single (SLTx) or double (DLTx) lung transplantation or heart-lung (HLTx) transplantation from January 2003-May 2004. GERD was assessed 3-6 months after transplantation by 24-hr pH testing. The fraction time (Ft) with a pH < 4 within a 24-hr period was recorded. Spirometry data, episodes of confirmed acute rejection, and demographic data were also collected. Ten transplant operations were performed: 4 DLTx, 1 SLTx, and 5 HLTx. Nine patients had cystic fibrosis. One patient had end-stage pulmonary disease secondary to chronic aspiration pneumonia and postadenovirus lung damage. Of 10 patients tested, 2 had severe GERD (Ft > 20%), 5 had moderate GERD (Ft 10-20%), 2 had mild GERD (Ft 5-10%), and 1 had no GERD. The only patient in this group with no GERD had a Nissen fundoplication pretransplant. All study patients were asymptomatic for GERD. All patients with episodes of rejection had moderate to severe GERD posttransplant. There was no association between severity of GERD and peak spirometry results posttransplant. Moderate to severe GERD is common following lung transplantation in children.
