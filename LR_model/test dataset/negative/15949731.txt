Effectivity of a T-cell-adapted induction therapy with anti-thymocyte globulin (Sangstat). Cytolytic induction therapy with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) should induce effective immunosuppression, with a low rate of rejection in the initial phase after heart transplantation. Induction therapy with ATG allows post-operative renal recovery without the negative effects of highly nephrotoxic cyclosporine levels. An increased rate of infection is a common problem, however, and has been associated with "over-immunosuppression" early after transplantation. Therefore, we investigated whether reduced T-cell-adapted ATG induction therapy could be performed without increasing the risk of graft loss by rejection and whether reductions in infection rates and costs are possible. Between March 1999 and December 2002, T-cell-adapted ATG induction therapy with ATG (Sangstat) (1.5 mg/kg) was given to 62 heart transplant recipients (study group) starting on post-operative Days 1 to 6. T-lymphocyte sub-populations were screened daily using flow cytometry. If total lymphocytes were <100/microl (reference 1,300 to 2,300/microl), T-helper lymphocytes (CD4+) <50/microl (reference >500/microl) and T-suppressor cells (CD8+) <50/microl (reference >300/microl), then no ATG was given. Further immunosuppression was continued with triple therapy consisting of methylprednisolone, azathioprine and cyclosporine. An historic group of heart transplant recipients given a full-dose ATG regimen for 8 days served as controls. These recipients were treated with ATG (Merieux 1.5 mg/kg) until reaching monoclonal cyclosporine levels of >300 mg/dl. Additional immunosuppressive treatment did not differ. Patients in both groups received systemic antibiotics (Imipenem) peri-operatively. Results of routine endomyocardial biopsies and rates of infections were examined. Study group patients were older (52 +/- 10 vs 49 +/- 14 years). In the study group, mean cumulative ATG dose was reduced significantly to 596 +/- 220 mg (p < 0.05) for 3.9 +/- 1.6 days compared with 1,159 +/- 376 mg for 6.9 +/- 1.1 days in the control group. The rate of cytomegalovirus (CMV) seroconversion was 23% in the study group compared with 13% in the control group. Rate of deep sternal infections was lower in the study group (1.6% vs 3.2%). The mean rejection rate in the first 3 months was 0.4 +/- 0.7 for the study patients (185 biopsies) vs 1.1 +/- 1.7 for controls (237 biopsies). All biopsies with ISHLT Grade >2 were treated successfully with 1,000 mg of methylprednisolone intravenously for 3 days. Both groups showed a similar 1-year survival rate (study 88%, control 89%). T-cell-adapted ATG induction therapy can be a helpful tool for individualized immunosuppression. It is not associated with an increased rate of rejection. Lower doses of immunosuppression help to minimize the rates of infection. In addition, cytolytic induction therapy combined with reduced ATG results in significant cost reduction.
