Sequential measurements of troponin Ic values in brain-dead patients considered as potential heart donors. It was suggested that a single value of normal or increased plasma cardiac troponin T or I (cTnT or cTnI) concentration could contribute to estimate donor myocardial damage and function in brain-dead patients. In patients with acute coronary syndromes, an initial normal value of troponin must be confirmed several hours later but no such recommendations exist for brain-dead patients. We investigated the relationship between two sequential (6 h interval) measurements of plasma cTnI concentrations in brain-dead patients considered as potential heart donors. The first and the second TnIc values were correlated with an adjusted r2 value of 0.92 (p<0.001). Our results suggest therefore that it is not necessary to repeat the measurements, when the value of plasma cTnI concentration is taken into consideration in the algorithm for cardiac harvesting.
