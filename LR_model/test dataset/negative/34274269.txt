Diagnostic Accuracy of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance for Cardiac Transplant Rejection: A Meta-Analysis. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the diagnostic performance of various CMR imaging parameters for evaluating acute cardiac transplant rejection. Endomyocardial biopsy is the current gold standard for detection of acute cardiac transplant rejection. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is uniquely capable of myocardial tissue characterization and may be useful as a noninvasive alternative for the diagnosis of graft rejection. PubMed and Web of Science were searched for relevant publications reporting on the use of CMR myocardial tissue characterization for detection of acute cardiac transplant rejection with endomyocardial biopsy as the reference standard. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and hierarchical modeling-based summary receiver-operating characteristic curves were calculated. Of 478 papers, 10 studies comprising 564 patients were included. The sensitivity and specificity for the detection of acute cardiac transplant rejection were 84.6 (95% CI: 65.6-94.0) and 70.1 (95% CI: 54.2-82.2) for T1, 86.5 (95% CI: 72.1-94.1) and 85.9 (95% CI: 65.2-94.6) for T2, 91.3 (95% CI: 63.9-98.4) and 67.6 (95% CI: 56.1-77.4) for extracellular volume fraction (ECV), and 50.1 (95% CI: 31.2-68.9) and 60.2 (95% CI: 36.7-79.7) for late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). The areas under the hierarchical modeling-based summary receiver-operating characteristic curve were 0.84 (95% CI: 0.81-0.87) for T1, 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89-94) for T2, 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74-0.81) for ECV, and 0.56 (95% CI: 0.51-0.60) for LGE. T2 values demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy, followed by native T1, ECV, and LGE (all P values <0.001 for T1, ECV, and LGE vs T2). T2 mapping demonstrated higher diagnostic accuracy than other CMR techniques. Native T1 and ECV provide high diagnostic use but lower diagnostic accuracy compared with T2, which was related primarily to lower specificity. LGE showed poor diagnostic performance for detection of rejection. 'CMR', 'cardiac transplant', 'meta-analysis', 'transplant rejection'
