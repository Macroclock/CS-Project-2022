Quality of life and function following cardiac transplantation in adolescents. Quality of life and functional status are important outcome measures following heart transplantation. The present study evaluated the quality of life and function of 10 adolescent heart transplant recipients at the Hospital for Sick Children. Subjects were surveyed using a visual analog quality of life scale, the Children's Depression Inventory, The Pediatric Quality of Life Scale 4.0, and the Functional Status IIR. Results demonstrated excellent perceived quality of life and psychologic well-being, comparable to healthy norms. Subscale results for physical, social, and emotional function provide evidence for positive responses to transplantation. As well, results on factors such as self-esteem, school, interpersonal function, and mood demonstrate gender differences that may influence outcomes. Studies are currently underway to further delineate these important quality of life, function, and psychosocial issues to ensure optimal outcomes are achieved in our patients.
