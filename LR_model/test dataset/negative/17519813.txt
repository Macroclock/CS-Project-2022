[Pulmonary mucormycosis: difficulties in diagnosis and treatment]. Mucormycosis is a rare opportunistic fungal infection due to filamentous fungi of the order Mucorales in the class Zygomycetes. Rhino-cerebral and pulmonary manifestations predominate on account of the airborn spread of the spores. Gastro-intestinal, cutaneous and disseminated disease is less common. The principal risk factors are immuno-suppression and diabetic keto-acidosis. One case of fatal pulmonary mucormycosis and two cases of colonisation illustrate both the extreme severity of this disease and the diagnostic difficulties facing the physician. The ubiquitous nature of the organism leads to frequent colonisation and, moreover, the symptomatology readily mimics that of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The diagnosis of mucormycosis can only be confirmed by pathological and mycological examination of biopsy specimens. These requirements conflict with the need for urgent treatment with surgical debridement, amphotericin B and control of the underlying pathology. Sadly the mortality remains very high, between 50 and 80% in published series. Currently there is hope of new therapeutic approaches with posaconozole but the ineffectiveness of voriconozole and the echinocandines, used more and more against aspergillus, raises the possibility of an increase in mucormycosis by selection.
