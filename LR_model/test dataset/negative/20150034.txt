Case report: nonarrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia presenting with severe right ventricular failure in an adolescent. Right ventricular dysplasia is usually discovered by the presence of ventricular arrhythmia. As arrhythmia is an epiphenomenon, the first presentation of some cases can be primarily heart failure. We describe an adolescent girl who presented with progressive right heart failure and whose hallmark was fibrofatty replacement of ventricular muscle, especially of the right side, without ventricular arrhythmia. The patient was successfully treated by orthotopic heart transplantation.
