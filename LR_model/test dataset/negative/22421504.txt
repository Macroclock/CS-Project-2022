Correlation of noninvasive markers of cardiac allograft rejection with endomyocardial biopsy: a case report. Although endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard to diagnose cardiac allograft rejection, the search continues for clinical parameters that may aid in the early diagnosis of rejection. We report the case of a 29-year-old man who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation and subsequently had multifocal moderate allograft rejection. During the patient's hospital course, he exhibited a number of clinical parameters that served as important clues for the worsening rejection. After aggressive immunosuppression, the improvement of these markers hinted toward his eventual recovery.
