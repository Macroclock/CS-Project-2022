A modified technique for heterotopic heart transplantation in rats. Heterotopic heart transplantation in rats has been widely used in various experiments since Ono and Lindsey published their technique [2]. Many modifications have been reported to improve this animal model. In this study, we described a new modified Ono and Lindsey technique. BN and Lewis rats weighing 200 to 250 g were used as donors and recipients. Donor heart was transplanted into the recipients' abdominal cavity, anastomosing the donor bracheocephalic trunk (BT) and the right pulmonary artery (RPA) to the recipient's abdominal artery (AA) and inferior vena cava (IVC). Graft function was evaluated by pulse palpation and histopathologic examination; intragraft cytokine mRNA expression was detected by quantitative PCR; the hemodynamics indexes of the recipients receiving our modified approach and traditional Ono and Lindsey technique were compared. Thirty heart transplantations were carried out in our modified technique with three graft losses. The total operation can be finished within 1h. Both histopathologic findings and quantitative PCR results confirmed the presence of acute graft rejection. In addition, the hemodynamics indexes of recipients receiving our modified approach were nearer normal physiologic situation than those of recipients receiving traditional technique. Our modified technique is an easily learned and reproduced procedure that allows less recipient surgical stress, a shorter operation time, and leads to a high graft and recipient survival rate.
