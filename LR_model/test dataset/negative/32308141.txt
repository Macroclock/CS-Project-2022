Heart-lung transplantation for refractory diffuse alveolar hemorrhage supported by prolonged extracorporeal membrane oxygenation after cardiogenic shock from ST segment elevation myocardial infarction: a case report. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage after percutaneous coronary intervention is a rare but fatal complication. Although timely application of extracorporeal membrane oxygenator and discontinuation of antiplatelet/anticoagulation is the treatment of choice, bleeding is often irreversible. Herein, we introduce a patient with refractory diffuse alveolar hemorrhage after prolonged extracorporeal membrane oxygenator and percutaneous coronary intervention, who was eventually rescued with heart-lung transplantation.
