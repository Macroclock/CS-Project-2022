Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells that endocytose allogeneic cells suppress T cells with indirect allospecificity. A portal venous injection of allogeneic donor cells is known to prolong the survival of subsequently transplanted allografts. In this study, we investigated the role of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) in immunosuppressive effects induced by a portal injection of allogeneic cells on T cells with indirect allospecificity. To eliminate the direct CD4+ T cell response, C57BL/6 (B6) MHC class II-deficient C2tatm1Ccum (C2D) mice were used as donors. After portal injection of irradiated B6 C2D splenocytes into BALB/c mice, the host LSECs that endocytosed the irradiated allogeneic splenocytes showed enhanced expression of MHC class II molecules, CD80, and Fas ligand (FasL). Due to transmigration across the LSECs from BALB/c mice treated with a portal injection of B6 C2D splenocytes, the naive BALB/c CD4+ T cells lost their responsiveness to stimulus of BALB/c splenic APCs that endocytose donor-type B6 C2D alloantigens, while maintaining a normal response to stimulus of BALB/c splenic APCs that endocytose third-party C3H alloantigens. Similar results were not observed for naive BALB/c CD4+ T cells that transmigrated across the LSECs from BALB/c FasL-deficient mice treated with a portal injection of B6 C2D splenocytes. Adaptive transfer of BALB/c LSECs that had endocytosed B6 C2D splenocytes into BALB/c mice via the portal vein prolonged the survival of subsequently transplanted B6 C2D hearts; however, a similar effect was not observed for BALB/c FasL-deficient LSECs. These findings indicate that LSECs that had endocytosed allogeneic splenocytes have immunosuppressive effects on T cells with indirect allospecificity, at least partially via the Fas/FasL pathway.
