Ultrastructural findings in porcine hearts after extracorporeal long-term preservation with a modified Langendorff perfusion system. Preserved ultrastructure is an important precondition for functional regeneration after heart transplantation. We investigated the effectiveness of a newly developed modified Langendorff system in extracorporeal heart perfusion. (Experiment I) Cardioplegia and cold ischaemia were performed in six pigs. Hearts were connected to a modified Langendorff system, and perfused with leucocyte depleted autologous blood. (Experiment II) The untreated hearts of three healthy pigs served as controls. Forty-seven myocardial biopsies at different timepoints (I: n = 29, II: n = 18) were investigated by transmission electronmicroscopy. Cardioplegia/hypothermia (I) induced mild-to-moderate mitochondrial swelling, mild myofibrillar degeneration in cardiomyocytes and moderate endothelial oedema. After 4 h reperfusion cardiomyocytes showed moderate myofibrillar and mild sarcolemmal damage. Moderate endothelial degeneration, mild interstitial oedema and haemorrhages appeared. Untreated hearts (II) showed severely damaged mitochondria and nuclei after 30 min while the myofibrillar structure remained unaffected until 4 h later. This is a promising model for extracorporeal heart perfusion. However, ultrastructural findings indicated that some necessary modifications to prevent cellular damages during reperfusion were needed.
