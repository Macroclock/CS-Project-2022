A contemporary review of mechanical circulatory support. Mechanical circulatory support has seen numerous advances in the recent years, with important observations made to guide patient selection for the therapy, indications for use, and management of devices after implantation. There is rapid growth in the use of left ventricular assist device therapy (LVAD) for advanced heart failure, with a movement to pursue device intervention earlier in the disease spectrum before comorbidities escalate. With this increase in LVAD use have come new challenges, including unanticipated adverse events and high readmission rates. Simultaneously, complications encountered during LVAD support and an increased number of patients supported with a goal for transplant have had an important effect on the allocation of cardiac allografts. Still, the field continues to evolve and address these challenges in systematic fashion to provide novel solutions and meet the needs of a growing population with advanced heart failure. This has led to an extensive body of literature, ranging from case reports to multicenter clinical trials, which will enhance the future of LVAD technology and patient outcomes. This review summarizes important publications in mechanical circulatory support during the past 24 months.
