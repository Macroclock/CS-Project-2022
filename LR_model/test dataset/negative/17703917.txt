Carotid endarterectomy prior to ventricular assist device placement. While there has been considerable debate regarding the timing of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with respect to coronary artery bypass grafting, the ventricular assist device (VAD) patient population presents possible new concerns, given the implications of stroke while on mechanical support as a bridge to transplant. We present the first report in the literature of CEA in a patient with severe carotid disease prior to elective VAD placement.
