Concurrent coronary grafting of the donor heart with left internal mammary artery: 10-year experience. We report 4 donor hearts with palpable atherosclerosis on the surface of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), which was thought to be significant. The heart ordinarily would have been rejected in the absence of availability of donor coronary angiography or bench angiography. Instead, we accepted the organ and bypassed the atherosclerotic lesion with a left internal mammary artery. Long-term outcome and follow-up are reported.
