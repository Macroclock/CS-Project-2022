Socioeconomic position, ethnicity, and outcomes in heart transplant recipients. The purpose of the present study was to assess whether a low socioeconomic (SE) position is associated with outcomes in heart transplant recipients. We used the US Census 2000 database to derive a summary SE score for 520 patients who had undergone underwent a first heart transplant at 1 of 4 Boston hospitals during 1996 to 2005 and compared the outcomes in the lowest quartile SE group (n = 129) to those for the remaining patients (n = 391). The low SE group and controls were similar with respect to cardiac diagnosis, hemodynamic support, listing status, year of transplant, and initial immune suppression. Low SE patients were more likely to be nonwhite. Graft loss occurred in 142 patients (135 deaths and 7 repeat transplants). Hospital mortality after transplantation was not associated with race/ethnicity or low SE position. In patients who survived the transplant hospitalization, nonwhite ethnicity (hazard ratio 1.8, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.9) and low SE group (hazard ratio 1.7, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.5) were associated with a greater risk of subsequent graft loss. In the adjusted analysis, the risk of graft loss remained greater for both nonwhite race/ethnicity (hazard ratio 1.7, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 2.9) and low SE position (hazard ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 2.4). Rejection episodes were more frequent in nonwhite transplant recipients and in those in the low SE group. In conclusion, among heart transplant recipients who survive the transplant hospitalization, nonwhite recipients and those in a low SE position are at greater risk of rejection and graft loss.
