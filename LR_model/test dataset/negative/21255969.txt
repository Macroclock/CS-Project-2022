Prediction of stroke volume by global left ventricular longitudinal strain in patients undergoing assessment for cardiac transplantation. Speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) is a novel technique that can be used for assessment of left ventricular (LV) longitudinal deformation dynamics. Using cardiac catheterization as the reference standard, the aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) assessed by STE and LV stroke volume in patients undergoing assessment for cardiac transplantation. Conventional echocardiography and STE were performed during right-sided cardiac catheterization in 51 patients referred for cardiac transplant assessment. Thermodilution LV stroke volume indexed (LVSVI) was used as the reference standard. Univariate regression analyses and receiver operating characteristics curves were used to test correlations between LVSVI and GLS by STE. Global longitudinal strain was obtained successfully in 95.5% of patients. Among all variables analyzed, GLS best predicted the LVSVI (r = 0.79; P < .0001). Minor correlations with the LVSVI were observed for tissue Doppler-derived systolic mitral annular velocity (r = 0.51; P < .005) and for LV ejection fraction (r = 0.32; P < .05). In a group of patients referred for cardiac transplant assessment, LV longitudinal deformation analysis by STE closely correlates with LVSVI, suggesting that, in this particular clinical setting, this new parameter may help provide an accurate, noninvasive, and quantitative assessment of LV function.
