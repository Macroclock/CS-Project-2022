[Followup of adults with a Fontan-type cavopulmonary derivation]. The Fontan procedure is a technique used in single ventricle syndromes and initiates a circulation which bypasses the right ventricle. It was described by Fontan in 1971. Many variations of this operation have been described and classified under the term of total cavopulmonary derivation. These operations result on long-term functional benefit. However, the 15 year survival rate is only 55 to 80%. This procedure (often carried out in childhood) is considered to be palliative rather than curative. The mortality is due to long-term complications, the frequency of which increases with the length of follow-up of the patient. The causes are: the Fontan circulation itself (arrhythmias, thrombosis, inferior caval stasis (hepatic, exsudative enteropathy), recurrence of cyanosis): the underlying cardiac disease (ventricular failure, atrioventricular valvular regurgitation); other complications (endocarditis and extracardiac, in particular orthopedic problems). Any of these complications may be an indication for cardiac transplantation, a high risk procedure because of previous multiple surgical interventions.
