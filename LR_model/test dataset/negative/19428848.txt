Influenza vaccination coverage among adult solid organ transplant recipients at three health maintenance organizations, 1995-2005. Annual immunization against influenza is recommended for solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. We used Vaccine Safety Datalink data from 1995 to 2005 to assess influenza vaccination during the first full vaccination season (September-February) following transplant among 1800 kidney, liver, and heart transplant recipients at three health maintenance organizations. Overall, 52% of recipients were vaccinated. Older age at transplant (age 50-64 years, OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.43-2.30; age > or =65 years, OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.39-2.69), receiving vaccination in the full season pre-transplant (OR 4.54, 95% CI 3.67-5.60), and year of transplantation were significant predictors of post-transplant vaccination. Although vaccine coverage increased during study years, SOT recipients are under-immunized against influenza. Efforts to understand barriers to vaccination and increase education of physicians managing patients while awaiting and after receipt of transplant are needed.
