A reappraisal of the pharmacologic management of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with continuous flow left ventricular assist devices. Advancements in the design and functionality of continuous flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVADs), as well as a limited number of donor hearts, have resulted in an increased utilization of this therapy among advanced heart failure (HF) patients. Despite these advancements, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) remains a common complication after CF-LVAD implantation. The mechanism of GIB in these patients is complex and includes a combination of angiodysplasia, platelet dysfunction, acquired von Willebrand disease, and a variety of patient-specific factors including advanced age and history of GIB. Several pharmacotherapy options have been reported in the literature, though studies supporting the use of these agents are often small, retrospective reports. Within this review, we discuss the various pharmacologic agents, their proposed mechanisms of action, and the available literature pertaining to their effectiveness and tolerability. Additionally, we propose an evidence-based treatment algorithm, encompassing the updated literature, cost of therapy, medication side effects, and ease of administration.
