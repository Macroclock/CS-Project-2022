Transfer of cholesterol and other lipids from a lipid nanoemulsion to high-density lipoprotein in heart transplant patients. Beyond the first year after a heart transplant (HT) procedure, patients often develop dyslipidemias, which may be implicated in the genesis of transplant coronary heart disease. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) has a several anti-atherogenic properties, but the status of HDL in HT patients is still controversial. Nonetheless, determination of HDL cholesterol concentration is not sufficient for evaluation of the overall HDL protective role. In this study, a fundamental functional property of HDL, the ability to simultaneously receive the major lipid classes, was tested in HT patients. Twenty HT patients and 20 healthy normolipidemic subjects paired for gender, age and body mass index were studied. Blood samples were collected after 12-hour fasting for determination of plasma lipids, glucose, paraxonase 1 (PON 1) activity, HDL diameter and transfer of labeled lipids from an artificial nanoemulsion to HDL. Plasma triglycerides (159 +/- 63 vs 94 +/- 35 mg/dl) and glucose (104 +/- 20 vs 86 +/- 10 mg/dl) were greater in HT patients than in control subjects. HDL cholesterol was lower and HDL diameter was smaller in the HT group (HDL cholesterol: 44 +/- 11 vs 55 +/- 15 mg/dl; HDL diameter: 8.8 +/- 0.6 vs 9.0 +/- 1.2 nm). PON 1 activity did not differ (87 +/- 47 vs 75 +/- 37 nmol/min/ml). The transfer rates of free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters were diminished in HT patients (HT: 8.4 +/- 1.2% and 3.8 +/- 0.6%; controls: 9.7 +/- 1.9% and 4.7 +/- 1.2%, respectively). The transfer of free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters to HDL is diminished in HT patients; disturbance in the ability of HDL to receive lipids may affect the anti-atherogenic properties of the lipoprotein.
