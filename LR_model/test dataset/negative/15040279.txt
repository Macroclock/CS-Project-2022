Waiting together: translating the principles of therapeutic relationships one step further. Inconsistent nursing practices created nurse-patient boundary issues on a cardiac step-down unit related to confidentiality, limit setting, and professionalism with patients and families awaiting organ transplantation. A staff work group designed and implemented a plan to translate the principles of therapeutic relationships into daily practice. A work plan developed for nursing staff outlined concrete solutions and resources available within the hospital. This framework can be used to empower staff in the ongoing effort to manage relationships with chronically ill patients and their families.
