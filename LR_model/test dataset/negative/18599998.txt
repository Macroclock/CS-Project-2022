[Effect of cariporide on the expression of bcl-2 and bax genes after neck heart transplantation from non heart-beating rats caused by warm ischemia]. To detect the expression of bcl-2 and bax genes after heterotopic heart transplantation in rats that died of warm ischemia, and to explore the effect of cariporide on the protection of the ratos non heart-beating donors. One hundred and twelve clearing Sprague-Dawley male rats were divided into 7 groups at random (each group contained 16 rats): the control group (Group C), the groups of transplanted hearts after 10, 30, and 45 min of asystolia (Group S10,S30,and S45), and the groups of transplanted hearts after 10,30, and 45 min of asystolia and infused with cariporide(Group SH10,SH30, and SH45).The experimental groups were sacrificed totally by warm ischemia, and heterotopic heart transplantation was processed by the Cuff method. The heart samples of S10,SH10,S30, and SH30 groups were taken at 48 hours after the transplantation, and the heart samples of S45, and SH45 groups were taken just after transplantation. The expression of bcl-2 and bax genes were detected by RT-PCR. The death of rats was affirmed when cardiac electric waves vanished after 9~11 minutes of transsection of abdominal aorta. On the RT-PCR test, the expression of bcl-2 gene was the highest and ROD value was maximum in the control group. The expression of bax gene was the lowest and ROD value was minimum in the control group. The ROD value of bcl-2 genes in S10 and S30 groups was less than that in SH10 and SH30 group. The ROD value was just the opposite, and there was stastistical difference (P<0.05).There was no statistical difference between Group S45 and Group SH45 (P>0.05). The model of heteroto-pic neck heart transplantation is a convenient animal model for the cardiac muscle protection. Cariporide can suppress the apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells in rats (within 30 min) after death caused by warm ischemia.
