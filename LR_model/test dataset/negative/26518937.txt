Role of Vascular Disease in the Evolution of Heart Transplant Patients. The clinical profile of heart transplantation (HT) recipients has changed in recent years. Nowadays, we have to deal with a higher number of co-morbidities, including peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Previous studies suggest an increase in post-HT morbidity and mortality associated with PVD, especially when it is symptomatic. Our study aims were to analyze the prognostic implications of the presence of PVD before transplantation and to determine the factors associated with its development after it. HT patients (n = 217) who survived the first year after surgery were included in the study. Mean follow-up was 9 ± 5 years. There were no statistically significant differences in mortality rates between patients with PVD (before or after HT) and those without. One third of patients with PVD required surgery in the post-HT monitoring, either revascularization or amputation. Furthermore, the prevalence of PVD was doubled. Dyslipidemia before HT (odds ratio [OR]: 2.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-6.4; P < .01) and older recipient age (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.09; P < .05) were independently associated with development of PVD by means of multivariate analysis. The presence of PVD must be evaluated individually in candidates for heart transplantation despite being a relative contraindication to it at the present time.
