Bariatric Surgery Is Associated With Decreased Calcineurin Inhibitor Time in Therapeutic Range After Heart Transplantation. Bariatric surgery (BSg) is an effective treatment for morbid obesity, but little is known about the outcomes of BSg patients who undergo orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). The aim of this study was to determine if BSg alters calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) level variability after OHT. Data were collected from 58 consecutive patients who underwent OHT at a single center from 1/2018 to 4/2019: 4 with BSg prior to OHT (BSg + OHT) and 54 without prior BSg (OHT). CNI level, cardiac biopsy, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) data were collected during the first 6 months post-OHT. Comparisons were made for 3 measures of CNI variability: coefficient of variation, time in therapeutic range (TTR), and TTR by the Rosendaal method. A Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the relationship between CNI TTR, episodes of rejection, and LVEF. The results show TTR was lower in BSg + OHT compared to OHT (12.5% vs 31.3%, P < .05). For the entire cohort, greater TTR correlated with fewer episodes of rejection (r = 0.31, P < .05). In conclusion, these findings suggest BSg + OHT patients may warrant closer monitoring of CNI levels post-OHT. Furthermore, episodes of rejection and LVEF were similar for BSg + OHT patients, indicating that BSg should not be a contraindication to transplant.
