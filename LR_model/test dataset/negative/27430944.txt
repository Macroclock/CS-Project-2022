A delayed splenic rupture after transcatheter arterial embolization required total splenectomy in a patient with an implantable left ventricular assist device. We successfully managed a splenic injury and delayed splenic rupture in a patient with an implantable left ventricular assist device (iLVAD). A 42-year-old man with an iLVAD for idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy was admitted to our department complaining of dizziness. Laboratory data showed severe anemia, and computed tomography demonstrated a traumatic splenic injury. Following conservative treatment, partial splenic embolization was performed. Fifteen days after the intervention, the patient went into hemorrhagic shock due to delayed splenic rupture. Emergency total splenic embolization was performed, and total splenectomy was conducted later to prevent re-bleeding or abscess formation. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged on postoperative day 22. Finally, he underwent orthotropic heart transplantation without post-splenectomy sepsis or thrombotic complications 472Â days after splenectomy. Splenic injury should be considered as a possible complication of iLVAD. In addition, careful follow-up after transcatheter arterial embolization for splenic injury is essential for managing delayed splenic rupture.
