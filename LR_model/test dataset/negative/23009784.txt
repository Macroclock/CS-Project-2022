Plasma exchange for severe hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis in an orthotopic heart transplant recipient. We here report a 33-year old male with diabetes, hypertension and history of orthotopic heart transplantation treated by plasma exchange for severe HTG (hypertriglyceridemia) induced pancreatitis. At the time of presentation, his serum TG (triglyceride) level was 10,278 mg/dL. He underwent one of the three planned sessions of plasma exchange, resulting in a decrease in TG level from 4728 mg/dL to 1708 mg/dL. The hospital course was complicated with shock, hemorrhagic transformation of the pancreatitis and acute respiratory distress syndrome. This prevented any further plasma exchange sessions. He was subsequently discharged home in a stable state and TG level of 80 mg/dL. Plasma exchange can be safely used to manage HTG induced pancreatitis in heart transplant recipients.
