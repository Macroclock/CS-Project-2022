Is oral azithromycin effective for the treatment of cyclosporine-induced gingival hyperplasia in cardiac transplant recipients? Anecdotal evidence suggests that azithromycin is effective for the treatment of cyclosporine-induced gingival hyperplasia in solid-organ transplant recipients. We present the cases of two heart transplant patients who insidiously developed gingival hyperplasia, likely because of immunosuppression with cyclosporine, which was treated with azithromycin. Evidence supporting the efficacy of azithromycin in the treatment of cyclosporine-induced gingival hyperplasia in solid organ transplant recipients was searched for, identified, and then critically assessed. While no data were found specifically evaluating azithromycin in cardiac transplant patients, there were nine pertinent papers identified that evaluated the clinical question of interest in the renal transplant population [Wahlstrom et al. (1995) The New England Journal of Medicine 332, 753; Boran et al. (1996) Transplantation Proceedings 28, 2316; Gomez et al. (1997) Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation 12, 2694; Ljutic (1997) Dialysis & Transplantation 26, 787; Puig et al. (1997) Transplantation Proceedings 29, 2379; Nash et al. (1998) Transplantation 65, 1611; Nowicki et al. (1998) Annals of Transplantation 3, 25; Wirnsberger et al. (1998) Transplantation Proceedings 30, 2117; Citterio et al. (2001) Transplantation Proceedings 33, 2134]. These studies and case reports are summarized. While more evidence is required to support routine use of azithromycin for the treatment of cyclosporine-induced gingival hyperplasia in cardiac transplant recipients, preliminary published evidence from renal transplant patients is certainly favourable.
