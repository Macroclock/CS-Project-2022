Pathologic correlates of late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance in a heart transplant patient. We report the histopathologic correlates of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) at cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in a patient with heart transplant who died for graft failure a few months after the scan. Extensive late enhancement was present at CMR, and it correlated with extensive fibrosis at histology. To our knowledge, this is the first time the findings on contrast enhancement CMR are compared to the histology of the whole heart in a heart transplantation patient, and the correspondence between LGE and fibrosis, demonstrated in other cardiac pathologies, is confirmed also in this particular setting.
