[Cardiac graft allocation]. Until 2004, French rules for cardiac graft allocation were aimed at ensuring uniform organ distribution on the national scale, while logically giving priority to local teams. The allocation was center-based, with transplant MDs choosing the most suitable recipient from the local waiting list. In 2004, two national priority lists were added to the French cardiac graft allocation system. High Emergency 1 (HE1) is for patients with unstable hemodynamic status (on inotropes or ECMO), while High Emergency 2 (HE2) is for patients who develop complications during long-term circulatory support. Data from the French Biomedicines Agency show significantly poorer survival for HE1 patients than for HE2 patients. However, this should not lead to the conclusion that HE2 is a better strategy, as mortality during long-term circulatory support is not taken into account, and it is well known that the survival benefit of transplantation is significantly better in HE1 patients. Furthermore, the risk related to the quality of the cardiac graft must be taken into account. Indeed, the decision to transplant or not to transplant an HE1 patient with a given graft will impact not only the survival of the patient concerned, but also the waiting time of the other patients on the list, independently of allocation rules. This is also true for the criteria used to place a patient on the waiting list. Each cardiac transplantation team considers the level of risk before adding a patient to the waiting list, and this will impact not only the individual candidate but also the entire waiting list. Thus, even if allocation rules aim to provide all patients with the same chance of being transplanted across the entire country, the medical decision to accept a cardiac graft and to register a patient on the waiting list will make this process somewhat heterogeneous. This allows cardiac transplantation to be adapted to each individual case, independently of the rules. However, a multidisciplinary decision process is necessary to ensure fairness.
