Prostate Cancer in Men With Treated Advanced Heart Failure: Should we Keep Screening? To evaluate the outcomes of men diagnosed with prostate cancer (CaP) following implanted treatments for advanced heart failure. Given the increasingly favorable 10-year life expectancy, MedStar Washington Hospital Center screens heart transplant (HT) candidates for CaP and other malignancies prior to intervention. Men aged 18-90 with available pretransplant Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) who underwent left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and/or HT at MedStar Washington Hospital Center from 2007 to 2018 were identified. Serum PSA, CaP diagnosis, and treatment were captured and analyzed. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves. Data were available for 34 patients. Median age was 53 [IQR = 51-58]. Median follow-up was 77 months (95% CI = 40-87 months). Six men had postimplant elevated PSA (5.3; SD = 8.5) and 4 were diagnosed with CaP. Median age of CaP diagnosis was 59 [IQR = 58.5-62). As of 2018, 31 of the 34 patients were living, and none died from CaP. Five-year survival was 96% in those without CaP and 100% in those with CaP (Figure 2). Our cohort represents the largest known cohort with heart failure treated by LVAD and/or HT and CaP. Our median age of 59 at CaP diagnosis is considerably younger than the national median of 66.
