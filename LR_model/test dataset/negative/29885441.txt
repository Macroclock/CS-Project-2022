Screening RhoA/ROCK inhibitors for the ability to prevent chronic rejection of mouse cardiac allografts. Chronic rejection of transplanted organs is a major obstacle in organ transplantation. The main symptoms of chronic rejection are vessel occlusion and tissue fibrosis. Macrophages play a crucial role in chronic rejection. We showed previously that RhoA deletion or RhoA/Rock inhibition using Y27632 inhibitor reorganizes macrophage actin cytoskeleton, prevents macrophage movement to the cardiac allografts, and abrogates chronic rejection in rodent models. Although besides Y27632 there are other RhoA/ROCK inhibitors available commercially, their efficacy in inhibition of chronic rejection remains unknown. We screened four RhoA/Rock inhibitors for their ability to inhibit chronic rejection of BALB/c [H-2d] mouse cardiac allografts heterotopically transplanted into C57BL/6 [H-2b] recipients. We also tested the effect of inhibitors on macrophages in vitro. We found that out of four tested compounds, the Fasudil and Azaindole, inhibited vessel occlusion, tissue fibrosis, decreased M2 macrophage infiltration and abrogated chronic rejection of mouse cardiac allografts. The remaining inhibitors, SAR-407899 and SLX-2119, decreased only tissue fibrosis, and were ineffective or only slightly effective in inhibiting vessel occlusion. We also found that Azaindole and Fasudil affected actin cytoskeleton and protein expression in mouse peritoneal macrophages CONCLUSION: Results of these studies might help in development of anti-chronic rejection therapy for clinical use.
