Donor bone marrow cells play a role in the prevention of accelerated graft rejection induced by semi-allogeneic spleen cells in transplantation. Spleen or spleen plus bone marrow cells from (BALB/cxC57Bl/6)F1 donors were transferred into BALB/c recipients 21 days before skin or cardiac transplantation. Prolonged graft survival was observed on recipients treated with the mixture of donor-derived cells as compared to those treated with spleen cells alone. We evaluated the expression of CD45RB and CD44 by splenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells 7 and 21 days after donor cell transfer. The populations of CD8+CD45RBlow and CD8+CD44high cells were significantly decreased in mice pre-treated with donor spleen and bone marrow cells as compared to animals treated with spleen cells only, although these cells expanded in both groups when compared to an earlier time-point. No differences were observed regarding CD4+ T cell population when recipients of donor-derived cells were compared. An enhanced production of IL-10 was observed seven days after transplantation in the supernatants of spleen cell cultures of mice treated with spleen and bone marrow cells. Taken together these data suggest that donor-derived bone marrow cells modulate the sensitization of the recipient by semi-allogeneic spleen cells in part by delaying the generation of activated/memory CD8+ T cells leading to enhanced graft survival.
