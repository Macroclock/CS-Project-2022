Elevated pre-transplant pulmonary vascular resistance is associated with early post-transplant atrial fibrillation and mortality. Severely elevated pre-transplant pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) has been linked to adverse effects after heart transplantation (HTX). The impact of a moderately increased PVR before HTX on post-transplant outcomes remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of an elevated pre-transplant PVR ≥ 300 dyn·s·cm This observational retrospective single-centre study included 561 patients receiving HTX at Heidelberg Heart Center between 1989 and 2015. Patients were stratified by degree of pre-transplant PVR. Analyses covered demographics, post-transplant medication, mortality and causes of death after HTX, early post-transplant atrial fibrillation (AF), and length of the initial hospital stay after HTX. Ninety-four patients (16.8%) had a PVR ≥ 300 dyn·s·cm Elevated pre-transplant PVR ≥ 300 dyn·s·cm 'Atrial fibrillation', 'Heart transplantation', 'Length of initial hospital stay', 'Mortality', 'Pulmonary vascular resistance'
