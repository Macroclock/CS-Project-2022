Altered Biatrial Phasic Function after Heart Transplantation in Children. We used two-dimensional echocardiographic speckle-tracking to investigate whether left and right atrial (LA and RA) phasic function in pediatric heart transplantation (HT) patients is altered and explored the relationship to HT-related clinical variables. Eighty-six subjects (36 HT and 50 normal children) were prospectively enrolled in two centers. Clinical data included age at HT, bypass time, ischemia time, donor age, and incidence of rejection. Atrial deformation indices including strain and strain rates (SRs) were measured using two-dimensional echocardiographic speckle-tracking. Components of phasic atrial function-reservoir (ε The mean age and body surface area of HT subjects were 10.2 ± 6.2 years and 1.2 ± 0.6 m Atrial strain determination is feasible in pediatric HT recipients and demonstrates disruption of reservoir, conduit, and booster function of both atria in this population; we speculate this may be a consequence of ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
