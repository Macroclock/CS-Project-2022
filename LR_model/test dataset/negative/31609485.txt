Use of the Heartmate 3 for biventricular support as a bridge to heart transplant-first US implant. Right ventricular failure continues to be the Achilles heel in the management of heart failure patients. Traditionally, either high doses of inotropes and inhaled nitric oxide or jerry-rigged temporary mechanical devices have been used to support failing right ventricles. No durable implantable right ventricular assist device has been developed to address this long-standing concern. Because of this vacuum of innovation, surgeons have started using the third-generation LVADs to support the right ventricle. The HeartMate 3 (Abbott) LVAD is a safe and effective therapy for the management of biventricular failure. 'MCS', 'adult', 'cardiac', 'transplant'
