Current status of the MicroMed DeBakey Noon Ventricular Assist Device. The HeartAttendant programs the controller and sets pump rpm and alarm thresholds. It collects and stores pump parameters when connected to the controller and enables remote monitoring via the Internet. It charges and reconditions the batteries and can provide electrical power from the wall. It eliminates the need for the Clinical Data Acquisition System and the Patient Home Support System. The new controller, in all modes, displays pump flow (L/min), current/amps, power/watts, rpm, and diagnostic and emergency alarms. The HeartAssist 5 is CE-approved in Europe. A new U.S. Food and Drug Administration study of the HeartAssist 5 as a bridge to transplant is being finalized.
