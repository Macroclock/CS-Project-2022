[The top ten major advances in heart disease and stroke research in 2008: a compilation of the AHA]. Following the tradition, the AHA has compiled a list of the top 10 major advances in heart disease and stroke research in 2008. As always, the choice was rather eclectic. There were, to start with, a series of papers providing objective data to validate several programs of public health, prevention, or good practice promotion that the AHA has initiated, or encouraged. Then came the results of some recent clinical trials which may prompt a change in clinical habits, or even in international guidelines related to cardio- or cerebro-vascular disease. Finally, the AHA identified new areas of research which, even if they are still in their early development, show significant promise for the future of medicine.
