Acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease after combined heart-liver transplant in patients with congenital heart disease: A retrospective case series. Although it is known that children undergoing heart transplantation are at increased risk for both AKI and CKD, renal function following CHLT remains understudied. All pediatric CHLT patients from 2006 to 2019 were included. The prevalence of AKI in the first 7 post-operative days, renal recovery at 30 post-operative days, and CKD were ascertained. AKI was defined as an increase in creatinine greater than 1.5 times baseline, and CKD, as an eCrCl less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m 'acute kidney injury', 'chronic kidney disease', 'combined heart-liver transplant', 'congenital heart disease'
