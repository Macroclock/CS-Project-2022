The Great Ormond Street Hospital immunoadsorption method for ABO-incompatible heart transplantation: a practical technique. Traditionally, ABO-incompatible heart transplantation was accomplished using a plasma exchange technique to remove recipient plasma containing donor-incompatible anti-A/B isohaemagglutinins. However, this technique exposed patients to large volumes of allogeneic blood and blood products (up to three times the patient's circulating volume). In 2018, we published the first reported case of an ABO-incompatible heart transplant using an intraoperative immunoadsorption technique which minimises the exposure to blood products by specifically targeting anti-A/B isohaemagglutinins. We have subsequently used this technique in all children undergoing ABO-incompatible heart transplantation and become convinced of its efficacy in this population while observing no adverse effects. This article outlines the practical details required to perform the technique in order to avoid hyperacute rejection.
