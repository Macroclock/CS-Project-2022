Accommodation after lung xenografting from hamster to rat. Long-term xenograft survival can be achieved in hamster hearts transplanted into rats treated with cobra venom factor (CVF) and cyclosporine A (CsA). This phenomenon of "accommodation" is associated with expression of protective genes such as bcl-2, bcl-X(L), and heme-oxygenase-1. We examined whether accommodation could be induced in hamster-to-rat lung xenografts and whether the pattern of protective genes is similar to cardiac xenografts. We used hamster-to-rat cardiac and lung xenotransplantation models. Cardiac xenotransplants were treated with CVF+CsA and compared with untreated controls. Lung xenotransplants were treated with either CVF+CsA or FK506 and cyclophosphamide (Cp) and compared with untreated controls. All recipients were killed by 21 days after transplantation. We examined graft survival and protein expression of protective genes, and we performed histologic and immunohistologic analyses. Rejection occurred rapidly in untreated rats. CVF+CsA or FK506+Cp treatment significantly influenced graft survival. Eight of 12 CVF+CsA-treated heart transplants survived 21 days. Seven of 16 CVF+CsA-treated lung grafts and five of 12 FK506+Cp-treated lung xenografts survived 21 days. We observed significant protein expression of bcl-2, bcl-X(L), and heme-oxygenase-1 in cardiac xenografts treated with CVF+CsA at 2, 14, and 21 days after transplantation, compared with normal hamster hearts. We also observed significant expression of these proteins in lung xenografts treated with either CVF+CsA or FK506+Cp at 21 days after transplantation, compared with normal lungs. Accommodation may be a general phenomenon for all organs, mediated through protective genes. Induction of accommodation does not require disruption of the complement system.
