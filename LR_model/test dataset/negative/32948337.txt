Evidence-based surgical hypothesis: Partial heart transplantation can deliver growing valve implants for congenital cardiac surgery. Children undergoing congenital cardiac surgery often outgrow the valve implants. These children are thus committed to morbid reoperations for successive exchanges of the vavular implants that they have outgrown. Therefore the holy grail of congenital cardiac surgery is a valve implant that grows with the recipient child. Preserved homografts routinely are used as valve implants, but they do not grow as the child grows because they lose viability during preservation. In contrast, pulmonary autografts and pediatric heart transplants grow with the recipient children. Similarly, partial heart transplantation can deliver growing valve implants for congenital cardiac surgery. Temporary immune suppression would only be needed until the partial heart transplant can be exchanged for an adult-sized prosthetic valve in the grown child.
