Romiplostim as a transfusion saving strategy in 20 patients after heart or lung transplantation: a single centre before-after pilot study. Thrombocytopenia is a common disorder after heart or lung transplantation. Platelet transfusion is often required to maintain haemostasis but represents a specific cause of morbidity and mortality in this setting including alloimmunisation and graft rejection. As part of a health-care quality improvement project, in a single-centre before-after pilot study, the relevance of a platelet transfusion saving strategy based on romiplostim administration after transplantation was assessed in patients with platelet count <100 × 10 Ninety-three patients were analysed (73 before vs. 20 after). The median [interquartile range] number of platelet concentrate was 1 [0;4.0] before versus 0.5 [0;2.0] in the after period, mean difference 0.5 confidence interval 95% [-0.7 to 1.7], p  Romiplostim did not significantly reduce platelet transfusion after heart or lung transplantation. Its relevance and safety in a global transfusion strategy remains to be studied in this setting in a large randomised study.
