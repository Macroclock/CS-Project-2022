Effect of vasopressin on sublingual microcirculation in a patient with distributive shock. To assess the sublingual microcirculation in a patient during vasopressin administration for a distributive shock after cardiopulmonary bypass. Case-report in the Department of Intensive Care of a university hospital. A 53 year-old man developed severe distributive shock after cardiac transplant, requiring massive doses of vasopressor agents. Vasopressin administered twice at a dose of 0.02 U/min increased mean blood pressure and allowed partial weaning of other vasopressor drugs. Microcirculatory alterations were assessed by orthogonal polarization spectral technique: 50% and 60% of capillaries were perfused at baseline, and these proportions did not worsen when vasopressin was administered. Despite its strong vasopressor effects vasopressin infusion did not worsen microcirculatory alterations in this patient with distributive shock following cardiac surgery.
