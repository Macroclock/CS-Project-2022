Does pretransplantation etiology have any effect on exercise results in heart transplant patients? The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of pre-transplantation etiology and post-transplantation exercise on pulmonary function tests, functional capacities, psychological symptoms and quality of life among heart transplant patients. An eight-week exercise program was applied to 35 heart transplant patients with histories of ischemic heart failure (HF; n = 20) or dilated HF (n = 15). All patients were evaluated before and after exercise in terms of breathing function tests, functional capacity (FVC; maximal oxygen consumption, pVO2), psychological symptoms (Beck Depression Scale (BDS), Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)) and quality of life (Short Form 36, SF-36). At the end of the exercise compared to the pre-exercise period significant improvements were observed in all FVC%, FeV1%, FeV1/FVC%, pVO2, SF 36 scores reflecting physical function, physical role, pain, general health, vitality, social function, and emotional role (P < 0.05) among heart transplant patients who were operated due to ischemic or dilated heart failure. In contrast, no significant improvement was observed in the BDS and STAI scales (P > 0.05). There was no significant etiology-related difference between the groups in terms of the evaluated parameters (P > 0.05). We demonstrated improvements in function tests, functional capacity and quality of life for both ischemic and dilated heart transplant patients following a supervised exercise program. We concluded that the positive effect achieved by exercise was not related to pre-transplantation etiology. Whatever the preoperative etiology, a regular exercise program is recommended for heart transplant patients in the rehabilitation unit.
