Early failure of a tricuspid valve replacement with a mitral valve homograft in a heart transplant recipient. A 24-year-old woman experienced severe tricuspid valve regurgitation 6 years after heart transplantation. Tricuspid valve replacement was performed using a cryopreserved mitral valve homograft. Severe tricuspid valve regurgitation recurred within 4 months, associated with an increase in the panel reactive antibody titers from zero to 72%. Tricuspid valve replacement was repeated with a porcine bioprosthesis with excellent recovery and function for >2 years. The mitral valve homograft displayed inflammatory features consistent with humoral immune-mediated destruction.
