Advancing immunosuppression therapy to counter the progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the major cause of late mortality in heart transplant recipients. Because immunosuppressive therapy has been convincingly shown to suppress cellular rejection and prolong cardiac allograft survival, we assessed the efficacy of advancing immunosuppressive therapy in reversing or delaying CAV by switching azathioprine to combination mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone (MMF-P). Seventeen adult posttransplant patients, whose CAV was prospectively approached with the MMF-P protocol, were studied. The development of significant CAV was declared on the index coronary angiogram and the MMF-P protocol was instituted. The degree of occlusion for all coronary lesions was quantitated for the index angiogram, and for the angiograms performed 1 year before (baseline) the index angiogram and annually for 2 years after the index angiogram (MMF-P years 1 and 2). There was a significant change in percent occlusion over time (P < .001). Percent occlusion increased significantly from the baseline year to the index CAV year, but then decreased significantly from the index CAV year to the MMF-P treatment years 1 and 2. Advancing immunosuppression with MMF-P can delay the progression of and partially reverse lumen narrowing of CAV in heart transplant recipients.
