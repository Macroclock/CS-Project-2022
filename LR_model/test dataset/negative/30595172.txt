Safety and Efficacy of PCSK9 Inhibitors After Heart Transplantation. Dyslipidemia is common in patients undergoing heart transplantation and is associated with the progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Two monoclonal antibodies directed against PCSK9i-evolocumab and alirocumab-are currently available. However, their use, safety and efficacy in the post-transplant setting have not been studied. We present our experience with 6 heart transplant recipients treated with a PCSK9i. A > 70% reduction in LDL-cholesterol was observed after evolocumab therapy. PCSK9 inhibitors are a potentially lipid-lowering therapeutic option for heart transplant patients with suboptimal LDL despite maximal tolerated statin doses.
