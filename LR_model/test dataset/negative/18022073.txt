Late reactivation of Chagas' disease presenting in a recipient as an expansive mass lesion in the brain after heart transplantation of chagasic myocardiopathy. Chagas' disease is endemic in many Latin American countries. In the last decades, millions of people from these countries have migrated to the United States, changing the scenario of acute Chagas' disease associated with blood transfusion in North America. We report the case of a chagasic patient who developed intracranial hypertension and focal neurologic signs 7 months after heart transplantation. Immunosuppression after transplantation was achieved with prednisone, cyclosporine A, and mycophenolate mofetil. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed a right temporoparietal mass lesion with surrounding edema. Trypanosoma cruzi was observed in the cerebrospinal fluid by Giemsa method, and autopsy disclosed a cerebral chagoma with amastigote forms of T cruzi, with neither associated myocarditis nor systemic infection. In chagasic patients who undergo heart transplantation and immunosuppression, the risk of late reactivation of Chagas' disease by means of an isolated cerebral mass lesion must be considered.
