Heart transplant recipient clinical profile improvement following mycophenolate mofetil late incorporation into the treatment schedule. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has a better clinical profile than azathioprine in heart transplantation (HT). Forty-five recipients (aged 53 +/- 9 yr) were retrospectively evaluated (first year of follow-up) post-MMF introduction since its advent in 1997 (mean daily dose: 1.97 +/- 0.2 g). MMF was used (mean post-HT time: 40 +/- 27 months) for: (i) renal insufficiency attenuation (group 1 = 20); (ii) steroid reduction because of osteoporosis (group 2 = 12); (iii) treatment of persistent cellular rejection (group 3 = 7) and vascular graft disease (VGD) (group 4 = 6). Mean changes (groups 1-2) were: creatinine 172 +/- 59, 158 +/- 51, 153 +/- 57 mumol/L (at baseline, 6 and 12 months, respectively; p < 0.001). Cyclosporine daily dose: 219 +/- 37, 166 +/- 46, 176 +/- 98 mg, respectively (p < 0.001). Cyclosporine blood concentration: 151 +/- 40, 103 +/- 41, 83 +/- 34 ng/mL, respectively (p < 0.004). Prednisone daily dose: 8.3 +/- 2, 5.2 +/- 1, 4.1 +/- 1 mg, respectively (p < 0.001). Cellular rejection (group 3) was successfully treated (86%) but the outcome of VGD did not improve after the switch (group 4). Our limited experience (with caution) confirms the reported benefits of MMF particularly attenuating renal insufficiency.
