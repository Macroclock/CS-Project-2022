Anthropometric growth and utilization of enteral feeding support in pediatric heart transplant recipients. We sought to outline trends in anthropometric growth before and after cardiac transplantation and to document our experience with the use of EFS in this population. A total of 130 patients (59% male) were enrolled and followed for a median of 4.4 yr after transplantation. Negative changes over time in weight z-score (EST: -0.256 [0.160] z/yr, p = 0.01), height z-score (EST: -0.214 [0.096] z/yr, p = 0.03), and BMI z-score (EST: -0.287 [0.161] z/yr, p = 0.07) were observed prior to transplantation. Significant increases in weight z-score (EST: +0.342 [0.143] z/yr, p < 0.001) and BMI z-score (EST: +0.396 [0.140] z/yr, p = 0.005) were seen in the first 18 months following transplantation. No further increases in height, weight, or BMI z-score were seen beyond this. Forty-two (32%) patients received EFS. Prior to transplantation, it was not found to be associated with change in anthropomorphic growth. Post-transplantation exposure to EFS was associated with a faster increase in weight z-score (EST: +0.480 [0.231] z/yr, p = 0.04) and height z-score over time (EST: +0.366 [0.141] z/yr, p = 0.01). Normalization of weight and height z-scores was not achieved during the study follow-up period. This study suggests that further investigation into the role of EFS is warranted to identify strategies to improve growth in pediatric heart transplant recipients.
