Orthotopic cardiac transplantation in a patient with pectus excavatum: approach via left anterior thoracotomy. Severe pectus excavatum, although a rare condition, is likely to be encountered by large transplant centers. The main concerns for transplant centers are the associated cardiopulmonary abnormalities along with the technical details of the transplant. We describe our experience managing a patient with severe pectus excavatum with associated cardiorespiratory abnormalities. This case report demonstrates that orthotopic cardiac transplantation through a left anterior thoracotomy is a feasible method in patients with significant displacement of the heart into the left chest.
