Cognitive function in adult cardiothoracic transplant candidates and recipients. Innovative surgical and medical techniques have prolonged the life span of cardiothoracic (CT) transplant recipients and made transplantation an option for many older patients. Cognitive function is a key determinant of the CT transplant recipient's ability to manage the complex treatment regimen and experience optimum benefit of the procedure. As the CT population ages, risk of cognitive dysfunction due to normal aging is compounded by the physical and mental changes associated with end-stage organ disease, comorbid conditions, and transplant-related complications. Cognitive abilities consist of (a) receptive functions (ability to select, acquire, classify, and integrate information); (b) memory and learning (ability to store and retrieve information); (c) thinking (ability to mentally organize and reorganize information; and (d) expressive functions (ability to communicate or act upon information). Although each of these functions represents a distinct type of behavior, they are interdependent. The purpose of this article is to (a) discuss the literature regarding cognitive function before and after adult heart, lung, and heart-lung transplantation; (b) identify methodological problems associated with the studies done to date; and (c) make recommendations for future research in this area.
