Outcome of renal transplantation subsequent to liver, heart, or lung transplantation. Renal dysfunction is a growing problem after liver, heart, or lung transplantation with the subsequent need for dialysis or renal transplantation. The aim of this study was to analyze the outcome after a subsequent kidney transplantation (secondary kidney transplantation) in liver, heart, or lung transplantation recipients. All secondary kidney transplantation patients from 1985 to 2006 were identified for the cause of kidney failure, time after initial transplantation, and current kidney function. One thousand two hundred three patient charts were reviewed including 22 (1.8%) secondary kidney transplantations: eight after lung, eight after heart, and six after liver transplantation. Renal failure was the result of perioperative renal failure (n = 3), toxic effects of cyclosporine (n = 16), a combination of cyclosporine nephrotoxicity and vascular ischemia (n = 3), or chronic renal failure due to polycystic kidney disease (n = 1). The median time after the initial organ transplantation was 114 months (range 30 to 241 months). The most recent median creatinine value was 103 micromol/L (82 to 704 micromol/L). Renal transplant rejection was noted in five patients: four in the lung transplant group, and one after heart transplantation. Three patients were deceased, one from secondary renal failure. One renal allograft was removed after renal artery thrombosis. In conclusion, there is sometimes a need for subsequent kidney transplantation after liver, heart, or lung transplantation. The outcome of renal transplantation subsequent to liver, heart, or lung transplantation is good with satisfactory renal function in this study population.
