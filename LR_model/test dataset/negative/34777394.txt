Blockade of IL-6/IL-6R Signaling Attenuates Acute Antibody-Mediated Rejection in a Mouse Cardiac Transplantation Model. Acute antibody-mediated rejection (AAMR) is an important cause of cardiac allograft dysfunction, and more effective strategies need to be explored to improve allograft prognosis. Interleukin (IL)-6/IL-6R signaling plays a key role in the activation of immune cells including B cells, T cells and macrophages, which participate in the progression of AAMR. In this study, we investigated the effect of IL-6/IL-6R signaling blockade on the prevention of AAMR in a mouse model. We established a mouse model of AAMR for cardiac transplantation  'IL-6', 'IL-6R', 'antibody-mediated rejection', 'cardiac transplantation', 'mouse model'
