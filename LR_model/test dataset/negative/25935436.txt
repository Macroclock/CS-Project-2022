Interleukin-17 receptor polymorphism predisposes to primary graft dysfunction after lung transplantation. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD), with an incidence of 11% to 57%, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality within the first 30 days after lung transplantation (LTx). In this study, we postulate that recipient genetic variants in interleukin-17 and -23 receptor genes (IL-17R and IL-23R, respectively) may predispose LTx recipients to an increased risk for developing PGD. Seven genetic variants of IL-17R and IL-23R were successfully genotyped in 431 lung transplant recipients. Our primary end-point was PGD and secondary end-points were time to extubation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophilia and serum C-reactive protein. The AA genotype of the rs882643 genetic variant of IL-17R was associated with higher PGD grades at 0 hour (adjusted p = 0.042), 12 hours (adjusted p = 0.013) and 48 hours (adjusted p = 0.0092) after LTx. The GG genotype of the rs2241049 genetic variant of IL-17R was associated with higher PGD grades at 48 hours (adjusted p = 0.0067) after LTx. For both genetic variants, no association was found with extubation time, ICU stay, post-operative BAL neutrophilia, serum CRP, chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) or graft loss. Both genetic variants of IL-17R (rs882643 and rs2241049) were associated with PGD. This confirms a genetic predisposition toward PGD and suggests a role of IL-17 in driving neutrophilia in PGD.
