Preventing alloimmune rejection using circular RNA FSCN1-silenced dendritic cells in heart transplantation. While heart transplantation is used as a standard treatment for heart failure, transplant rejection continues to pose a challenge. Recent evidence has shown that circular RNA (circRNA) is a new type of gene regulator in cell development. Our aim was to demonstrate that treatment with tolerogenic dendritic cells (Tol-DCs) generated by circular RNA FSCN1 (circFSCN1) silencing could prevent alloimmune rejection and prolong heart graft survival in heart transplantation. Bone marrow-derived DCs were transfected with circFSCN1 siRNA in vitro. The circFSCN1 level was measured by qRT-PCR. DC maturation was determined by flow cytometry. Mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs) were conducted to assess the function of DCs to activate T cells and to generate regulatory T cells (Tregs). In situ RNA hybridization and fluorescent microscopy were performed to detect the distribution of circFSCN1 in DCs. A heterotopic allogeneic murine heart transplantation was conducted where recipients were pre-treated with donor derived circFSCN1-silenced Tol-DCs. Heartbeat was monitored to assess immune rejection. Exonic circFSCN1 was highly expressed in the cytoplasm of mature DCs. Knockdown of circFSCN1 using siRNA arrested DCs at an immature state, impaired DC's ability to activate T cells and enhanced Treg generation. Treatment with circFSCN1-silenced Tol-DCs prevented alloimmune rejection, prolonged allograft survival, reduced fibrosis, and induced Tregs in vivo. Knockdown of circFSCN1 induces Tol-DCs and treatment with these Tol-DCs prevents alloimmune rejection and prolongs allograft survival. This is a promising therapeutic target to combat transplant rejection in heart transplantation and increases our understanding of circRNA in the immune system.
