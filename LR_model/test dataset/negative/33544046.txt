An  Pulmonary valve replacement is performed with excellent resultant hemodynamics in patients that have underlying congenital or acquired heart valve defects. Despite recent advancements in right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction, an increased risk of developing infective endocarditis remains, which has a more common occurrence for conduits of bovine jugular vein (BJV) origin compared with cryopreserved homografts. The reason for this is unclear although it is hypothesized to be associated with an aberrant phenotypic state of cells that reendothelialize the graft tissue postimplantation. The aim of this study was to develop an  'bioprostheses', 'cell adherence', 'flow chamber', 'infective endocarditis', 'reendothelialization', 'shear'
