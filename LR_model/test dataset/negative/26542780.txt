Pediatric heart transplant for unresectable primary cardiac tumor. Surgery for primary cardiac tumors in children includes complete resection, partial resection, and cardiac transplantation. A pediatric heart transplant in this setting is associated with significantly higher mortality and poorer long-term outcome, and it is reserved for unresectable tumors. We recently performed an emergency pediatric heart transplant in a 7-year-old boy with an unresectable cardiac fibroma in the left ventricle.
