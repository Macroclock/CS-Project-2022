Chromosomal Abnormalities Affect the Surgical Outcome in Infants with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome: A Large Cohort Analysis. Patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) can have associated genetic abnormalities. This study evaluated the incidence of genetic abnormalities among infants with HLHS and the short-term outcomes of this population during the first hospitalization. This is a retrospective analysis of the multi-center Pediatric Heath Information System database of infants with HLHS who underwent Stage I Norwood, Hybrid, or heart transplant during their first hospitalization from 2004 through 2013. We compared clinical data between infants with and without genetic abnormality, among the three most common chromosomal abnormalities, and between survivors and non-survivors. Multivariable analysis was completed to evaluate predictors of mortality among patients with genetic abnormalities. A total of 5721 infants with HLHS were identified; 282 (5%) had associated genetic abnormalities. The three most common chromosomal abnormalities were Turner (25%), DiGeorge (22%), and Downs (12.7%) syndromes. Over the study period, the number of patients with genetic abnormalities undergoing cardiac operations increased without any significant increases in mortality. Infants with genetic abnormalities compared to those without abnormalities had longer hospital length of stay and higher morbidity and mortality. Variables associated with mortality were lower gestational age, longer duration of vasopressor therapy, need for dialysis, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and complicated clinical course as suggested by necrotizing enterocolitis, septicemia. Presence of any genetic abnormality in infants with HLHS undergoing cardiac surgery is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Timely genetic testing, appropriate family counseling, and thorough preoperative case selection are suggested for these patients for any operative intervention.
