A case of pancreatic cancer after heart transplantation. Malignancy is not uncommon with immunosuppressive therapy, but pancreatic cancer is infrequently complicated in recipients of heart transplantation. Here we report a transplant case diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 4 years and 8 months after the heart transplantation. We changed the immunosuppressive regimen after the malignancy was detected, and administered everolimus along with chemotherapy using S-1, an oral fluoropyrimidine prodrug. The patient lived for 8 months after the diagnosis, and received metallic stenting for the biliary and duodenal obstruction. Also, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about chemotherapy and endoscopic intervention for pancreatic cancer in a heart transplantation patient.
