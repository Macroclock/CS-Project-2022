Feasibility of Intraoperative Extubation in Pediatric Heart Transplantation. Based on described benefits of fast-tracking and early extubation in children undergoing congenital heart surgery, we applied this concept to selected children following uncomplicated orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). In this case series, we report four patients who were extubated immediately after surgery in the operating room. A mild respiratory acidosis and hypercapnia were noted on the initial arterial blood gases, were well tolerated, and were normalized within 6 to 12 hours. There was no mortality among patients who were extubated in the operating room, and no patients required reintubation. We conclude that operating room extubation is feasible in selected patients undergoing OHT. 'heart transplantation', 'pediatric', 'pulmonary vascular resistance/hypertension', 'ventilation'
