Pneumonia due to Candida krusei. A case of post-transplantation pneumonia due to Candida krusei is reported. A 42-year-old man was admitted 28 days after heart transplantation with cough, pleuritic pain and fever. A chest computed tomograph showed multiple alveolar infiltrates bilaterally. He received broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluconazole for oral candidiasis, and cotrimoxazole for possible Pneumocystis carinii. A short-lived period of improvement was followed by respiratory failure. Cultures of bronchial washings grew C. krusei and C. albicans. The infection was documented by histology and culture obtained by transthoracic aspiration. Treatment with amphotericin B was initiated, but the patient died. Histology and culture of a pulmonary specimen, obtained immediately post mortem, further documented the infection with C. krusei.
