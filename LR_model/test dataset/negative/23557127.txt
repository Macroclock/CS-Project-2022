Interleukin receptor family member ST2 concentrations in patients following heart transplantation. To evaluate soluble (s) ST2 as a biomarker of rejection, allograft vasculopathy and mortality after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). sST2 concentrations were measured in 241 patients following OHT. Elevated sST2 was associated with cellular rejection (CR) ≥ 1R, with highest rates of CR in the 4th sST2 quartile (p = 0.003). No significant association between sST2 and antibody-mediated rejection or allograft vasculopathy was found. sST2 ≥ 30 ng/mL independently predicted death over 7-year follow-up (HR = 2.01; 95% CI 1.15-3.51; p = 0.01). Concentrations of sST2 are associated with the presence of CR and predict long-term mortality following OHT.
