Chimerism and bone marrow based therapies in transplantation. Composite tissue allotransplantation holds a great potential for providing increased knowledge of anatomy and microsurgical experience for life-enhancing reconstructions. Many transplant cases around the world have made this a clinical reality at the present time. Composite tissue allotransplants contain multiple tissue types, including bone, muscle, vessels, nerves, skin, and immune cells and bear a huge antigenic load. Although immunosuppressive drugs are applied successfully to prevent allograft rejection, their side effects pose a barrier to worldwide use. Bone marrow therapy in many tolerance induction protocols, therefore, provides a guide to reaching the target of permanent immunotolerance. Multiple studies suggest that bone marrow is immunomodulatory and may facilitate allograft acceptance. In this review, bone marrow based therapy protocols of clinical and experimental models are presented in two major categories: solid organ and composite tissue transplantation.
