Long-term effects on renal function of dose-reduced calcineurin inhibitor and sirolimus in cardiac transplant patients. Calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-associated renal insufficiency is common after cardiac transplantation (CTX); however, the addition of sirolimus allows for CNI dose reduction and this strategy may limit CNI renal toxicity. This study examines the long-term effects of such a strategy. Patients from a single center who had CTX from 1990 to 2007 and who were converted to sirolimus and a dose-reduced CNI were compared to group-matched controls maintained on CNI and an antiproliferative agent. One hundred and fifty-five patients (79 sirolimus and 76 controls) were included and had similar baseline characteristics. Sirolimus was started a mean of 1429 d post-CTX and maintained for a mean of 823 d. Reason for conversion to sirolimus was renal insufficiency (34%), vasculopathy (29%), recurrent rejection (19%), and other (18%). The eGFR was not different between groups at baseline (44.7 mL/min/1.73 m(2) vs. 46.0, p = 0.64) or at any point during follow-up: 90 d, 180 d, 1 yr, 2 yr, and 3 yr. conclusion: Patients converted to a regimen of sirolimus and a dosed-reduced CNI have stable renal function over the following three yr, but do not have an improvement in renal outcomes compared to patients maintained on full dose CNI.
