Usefulness of thrombosis and inflammation biomarkers in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension-sampling plasma and surgical specimens. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) results from persistent pulmonary vascular obstructions, presumably due to inflammatory thrombosis. Because estimates of thrombus volume at diagnosis have no predictive value, we investigated the role of the thrombosis marker, D-dimer, and the inflammation marker, C-reactive protein (CRP), for predicting outcomes in CTEPH. A total 289 consecutive patients with CTEPH were followed for 57 (median 45 to 69) months. One hundred fifty-seven of these patients underwent surgical pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA). D-dimer and CRP were collected at the time of CTEPH diagnosis and their impact on outcome was analyzed using Cox and logistic regression models. Their association with thrombus composition was analyzed utilizing HistoQuest. D-dimer and CRP levels were separately and independently predictive of death or need for lung transplantation (p = 0.012 and p = 0.025, respectively). For example, 5-year survival was 90% (confidence limits 84% to 96%) in patients with D-dimer levels <0.5 µg/ml and CRP <1 mg/dl at diagnosis, as compared with 50% (36% to 64%) for patients with D-dimer ≥0.5 µg/ml and CRP ≥1 mg/dl (p < 0.001). D-dimer and CRP both decreased significantly after PEA (p < 0.01). The amount of fresh red thrombus in thrombendarterectomy specimens correlated positively with D-dimer levels at diagnosis (r = 0.37, p = 0.003). D-dimer and CRP at the time of diagnosis are independent and significant predictors of outcome in CTEPH, available at the time of diagnosis. This observation suggests an important role for fibrin turnover and inflammation in the pathogenesis of CTEPH and the associated complications. 'CRP', 'CTEPH', 'D-dimer', 'inflammation', 'thrombosis'
