A single-center long-term experience with marginal donor utilization for heart transplantation. To evaluate the early and late outcome of heart transplantation (HT) using marginal (MDs) and optimal donors (ODs). Clinical records of recipients transplanted between July 2004 and December 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. MDs were defined as follows: age >55 years, high-dose inotropic support, left ventricular ejection fraction <45%, left ventricular hypertrophy, donor to recipient predicted heart mass ratio <0.86, ischemic time >4 hours. A total of 412 (55%) recipients received an organ from a MD; recipients who received an organ from an OD had less primary graft dysfunction (PGD) (25% vs 38%; P < .001), less acute renal failure (23% vs 34%; P < .001), and higher survival rates (90.2% vs 81.8% at 30 days, 79.5% vs 71.1% at 1 year, 51.8% vs 45.4% at 12 years; P = .01) than recipients who received an organ from a MD. There was no statistically significant difference in 30-day conditional survival between the two groups (survival rates 57.4% vs 55.5% at 12 years; P = .43). PGD, perioperative hemodialysis, and sepsis were independent risk factors of mortality at multivariate analysis. Utilization of MDs for HT is associated with a higher incidence of PGD and acute renal failure, and a reduction of 30-day survival. 'heart transplantation', 'marginal donor'
