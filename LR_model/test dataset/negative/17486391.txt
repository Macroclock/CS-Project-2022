Update in adult congenital cardiac surgery. The number of grown-up patients with congenital heart disease (GUCH) is constantly increasing and will equal the number of children requiring surgery for congenital heart disease (CHD). Specialized centers dealing with the medical and paramedical problems of these patients are required. GUCH patients can be divided into the following groups: (1) patients with minor cardiac malformations presenting at adult age for first treatment; (2) patients presenting for correction as adults because they are either naturally balanced or were surgically palliated; (3) patients presenting for expected reoperations after correction in childhood; (4) patients requiring repair of residual defects after correction; (5) patients developing heart failure after correction or palliation of CHD requiring thoracic transplantation; and (6) patients developing acquired heart disease in addition to CHD. Special aspects of malformations frequently occurring in GUCH patients are discussed in detail. Acquired heart disease in this patient population is expected to increase in the coming decades as survivors of CHD grow old.
