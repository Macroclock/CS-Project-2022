Building a Total Bioartificial Heart: Harnessing Nature to Overcome the Current Hurdles. Engineering a bioartificial heart has become a possibility in part because of the regenerative medicine approaches to repairing or replacing damaged organs that have evolved over the past two decades. With the advent of inducible pluripotent stem cell technology, it is now possible to generate personalized cells that make the concept of autologous tissue engineering imaginable. Scaffolds that provide form, function, and biological cues to cells likewise potentially enable the engineering of biocompatible vascularized solid organs. Decellularized organs or tissue matrices retain organ complexity and structure at the macro and micro scales, contain biologically active molecules that support cell phenotype and function, and are vascularized allowing full thickness tissue generation. There is also dynamic reciprocity between the extracellular matrix and cells, which does not occur with synthetic scaffolds and allows both to evolve as functional need changes, making it a unique scaffold. Yet, building a whole heart from decellularized scaffolds and cells requires delivering hundreds of billions of multiple types of cardiac cells appropriately and providing a milieu where they can survive and mature. We propose a novel type of in vivo organ engineering utilizing pre-clinical models where decellularized hearts are heterotopically transplanted with the intent to harness the capability of the body to at least in part repopulate the scaffold. By adding load and electrical input, possibly via temporary mechanical assistance, we posit that vascular and parenchymal cell maturation can occur. In this study, we implanted porcine decellularized hearts acutely and chronically in living recipients in a heterotopic position. We demonstrated that the surgical procedure is critical to prevent coagulation and to increase graft patency. We also demonstrated that short-term implantation promotes endothelial cell adhesion to the vessel lumens and that long-term implantation also promotes tissue formation with evidence of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells present within the graft. Utilizing endogenous repair capabilities of the recipient in response to a naked ECM, we allowed the transplanted scaffold to direct host cells-both organizationally and functionally. Thus, the scaffold provided necessary cues for cell organization and remodeling within the transplanted organ. Future work would involve culturing partially recellularized engineered organs in bioreactors where mechanical and electrical stimulation can be controlled to promote organ development and then transplanting these after a minimal level of maturation has been achieved.
