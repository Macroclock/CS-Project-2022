Display of Fas ligand protein on cardiac vasculature as a novel means of regulating allograft rejection. Fas ligand (FasL) is a potent death-inducing molecule with important functions in immune homeostasis and tolerance to self-antigens. The complex biological activities of FasL and its inefficient expression using conventional gene transfer approaches limit its use for immunomodulation to prevent allograft rejection. We have recently generated a chimeric FasL with core streptavidin (SA-FasL) with potent apoptotic activity and designed a novel approach to display it on the surface of several cell types via biotinylation. We herein tested whether SA-FasL can also be displayed on vascular endothelial cells in the heart and examined its effect on graft survival after transplantation into syngeneic and allogeneic hosts. SA-FasL was efficiently displayed on the vasculature of BALB/c hearts with a half-life of 9 days in vivo. Transplantation of hearts displaying SA-FasL into syngeneic hosts resulted in indefinite graft survival without detectable toxicity to the grafts and hosts. In contrast, transplantation of allogeneic C57BL/10 hearts displaying SA-FasL into BALB/c recipients resulted in graft rejection, but in a delayed fashion as compared with control hearts (mean survival time=17.4+/-5 versus 9.6+/-1 days). Allograft survival was further extended to 21+/-2.6 and 24+/-3 days (P<0.05) by intravenous treatment of graft recipients with 1 dose of SA-FasL-decorated donor splenocytes on days 2 and 6 after transplantation, respectively. This study shows for the first time that exogenous proteins can be displayed on the endothelium of solid organs for therapeutic purposes. This approach provides a convenient and rapid means of displaying exogenous proteins on the surface of cells, tissues, and solid organs, with broad research and therapeutic implications.
