Performance of limited sampling strategies for predicting mycophenolic acid area under the curve in thoracic transplant recipients. Eight limited sampling strategies (LSSs) for estimating mycophenolic acid area under the concentration-time curve (4 developed from lung transplant recipients at our center, 4 developed for heart transplant recipients from other research groups) were evaluated in 27 heart or heart-kidney transplant patients. The LSSs from our lung transplant patients performed well when applied to the heart transplant population, with percent bias and percent precision within the acceptable limit of +/-15%. The LSSs developed at our center are robust enough to be applied to both lung and heart transplant populations. Application of LSSs from other research groups yielded less optimal results, reinforcing the need to re-establish or re-validate LSSs for each specific center.
