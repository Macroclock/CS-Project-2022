Successful Combined Heart and Kidney Transplantation in Patient With Fabry's Disease: A Case Report. Fabry's disease is a X-linked hereditary disease that causes the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in tissues and organs, including the kidneys and heart. This can result in both chronic kidney disease and cardiac dysfunction, including arrhythmias and heart failure. We describe a case of a 62-year-old male with Fabry's disease undergoing successful combined heart and kidney transplantation for chronic renal failure and low-output systolic heart failure. The patient has normal cardiac function and normal renal function 7 years after transplantation, while being maintained on enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human alpha-galactosidase A. Fabry's disease is not a contraindication for organ transplantation, even in patients presenting with both renal failure and heart failure.
