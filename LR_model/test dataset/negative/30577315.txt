Successful Outcome Following Orthotopic Heart Transplantation With a Donor Half Way Across The Country. Orthotopic heart transplantation is the criterion standard treatment for end-stage heart failure and the number of recipient candidates has been increasing. Despite this increasing demand, there is limited donor organ supply. In order to surmount this challenge, we propose harvesting donor hearts from more distant locations and accepting longer cold ischemic times. The usual accepted total ischemic time limit for the transplanted human heart is up to 4 hours. Here, we report the successful use of a donor heart from 1268 miles away with a total allograft ischemic time greater than 6 hours.
