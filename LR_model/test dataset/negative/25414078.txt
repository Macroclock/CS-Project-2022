Echocardiographic evaluation of left ventricular filling pressure in heart transplant recipients. Diastolic dysfunction is a major cause of morbidity in heart transplant recipients. A reliable, non-invasive marker of left ventricular (LV) filling pressure would simplify follow-up in these patients. We aimed to test the validity of echocardiographic indices of LV filling pressure in a contemporary population of heart transplant recipients. Eighty-three patients were examined by right-sided heart catheterisation and echocardiography one year after heart transplantation. We explored the association between echocardiographic parameters of LV filling pressure and invasively measured pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). Peak early mitral flow velocity divided by septal early mitral relaxation velocity (E/e'(septal)) was the echocardiographic parameter that best correlated with PCWP (r = 0.47; p < 0.001). At a cut-off value of 22, E/e'(septal) could identify patients with a PCWP above 12 mm Hg with a sensitivity of 56% and a specificity of 95%. The E/e' index was moderately associated with LV filling pressure in heart transplant recipients. Echocardiographic parameters of diastolic function should be interpreted with caution when estimating left ventricular filling pressures in this population.
