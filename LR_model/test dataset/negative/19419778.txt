Eosinophil blood count and anemia are associated with Trypanosoma cruzi infection reactivation in Chagas' heart transplant recipients. Trypanosoma cruzi infection reactivation is a constant threat for Chagas' heart transplant recipients. From September 2000 to September 2007, 54 patients underwent heart transplantation at our institution. Fourteen (70%) out of 20 Chagas' disease patients who survived the perioperative period were entered into the study. Mean eosinophil count and mean hemoglobin plasma levels were associated to T. cruzi infection reactivation.
