Mesenchymal stem cells require a sufficient, ongoing immune response to exert their immunosuppressive function. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have emerged to be one of the most promising candidates for cellular immunotherapy in solid organ transplantation because the reduction of conventional immunosuppression is highly desirable. However, little is known about the details of MSC-mediated immunomodulation and their clinical relevance. To address conflicting studies about the ability of MSC to suppress or augment T-cell proliferation, we introduce a transplantation-related rat model that allows studying the influence of MSC on alloproliferation. Hearts transplanted in a fully allogeneic transplantation model (LEW to ACI) were rejected earlier when recipients were pretreated with donor MSC, indicating activation of T cells in vivo. In additional co-culture experiments, T cells were differently affected by allogeneic MSC depending on the extent of previous activation: When conditions were rendered proinflammatory by adding high concanavalin A (ConA) concentrations or proinflammatory cytokines (interferon-gamma, interleukin-2, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha), MSC inhibited proliferation. Application of low doses of ConA or anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 abrogated the suppressive effect of MSC. For application of MSC in solid organ transplantation, it will be important to further describe this switch effect of MSC function.
