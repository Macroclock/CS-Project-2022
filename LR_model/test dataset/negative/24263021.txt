Primary graft failure after heart transplantation: characteristics in a contemporary cohort and performance of the RADIAL risk score. Primary graft failure (PGF) is the leading cause of early heart transplantation (HT) mortality. Our aim was to analyze PGF currently and explore the ability of a dedicated score for PGF risk stratification. After applying a dedicated PGF definition, we analyzed its incidence, mortality, and associated factors in a multicenter cohort of 857 HTs performed in 2006 to 2009. We used the following criteria: recipient right (R) atrial pressure ≥ 10 mm Hg; age (A) ≥ 60 years; diabetes (D) mellitus, and inotrope (I) dependence; donor age (A) ≥ 30 years, and length (L) of ischemia ≥ 240 minutes to calculate the RADIAL score for PGF risk prediction. PGF incidence was 22%. The right ventricle was almost always affected, alone (45%) or as part of biventricular failure (47%). Mechanical circulatory support was used in 55%. Mortality attributable to PGF was 53% and extended through the third month after HT, but thereafter, PGF had little influence in long-term outcome. The RADIAL score was higher in PGF patients (2.78 ± 1.1 vs. 2.42 ± 1.1, p = 0.001) and stratified 3 groups with incremental PGF incidence: low risk (12.1%), intermediate risk (19.4%), and high risk (27.5%, p = 0.001). PGF had a strong impact, with an incidence of 22% and a mortality exceeding 50% that extends through the third post-HT month. The RADIAL score classified patients into 3 groups with incremental risk for PGF and may be useful for its prevention and early therapy.
