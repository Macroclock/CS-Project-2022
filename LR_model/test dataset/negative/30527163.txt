Coronary Vasospasm Following Heart Transplantation: Rapid Progression to Aggressive Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy. Coronary artery vasospasm (CVS) has been described in orthotopic heart transplant patients but is rare in the post-transplanted, denervated heart. Severe CVS has been associated with accelerated cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) and allograft rejection. Allograft vasculopathy is the leading cause of decreased long-term survival in orthotopic heart transplant. The prognostic significance and relationship of the presence and severity of CVS with CAV are not well understood. We present a case of severe symptomatic CVS with rapid development of severe CAV. Our case emphasizes the need for close angiographic surveillance and intracoronary imaging for early detection of CAV in the presence of vasospasm.
