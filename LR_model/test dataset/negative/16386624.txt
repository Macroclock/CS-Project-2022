Pulmonary tuberculosis in lung and heart-lung transplantation: fifteen years of experience in a single center in Spain. The increase in the number of solid organ transplants has resulted in an increased incidence of opportunistic infections, including infection by typical and atypical mycobacteria, with risk of developing tuberculosis. Pretransplant chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid has become increasingly common in an attempt to prevent the disease. The source of infection in tuberculosis (TB) may be difficult to identify. Infection may be caused by reactivation of a primary infection in the recipient, reactivation of a lesion from the donor lung, or primary infection. There are few reports on TB in lung transplantation. Incidence in the reported series ranges from 6.5% to 10%. Our series of 7 patients out of a total 271 patients (2.58%) represents a rate higher than reported for the general Spanish population, 26.7/10(5) inhabitants and for lung transplant candidates (0.18%). Our aim was to evaluate the incidence, clinical signs, and outcome of TB in our series of patients undergoing lung transplantation in the 15 years since inception of the program (February 1990 to December 2004). Morbidity and mortality was high (42.8%), but limited to patients in whom treatment was not administered or could not be successfully completed. However, early detection and treatment are essential.
