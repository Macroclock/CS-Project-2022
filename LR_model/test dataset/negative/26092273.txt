Comparison of 2-Year Outcomes of Extended Criteria Cardiac Transplantation Versus Destination Left Ventricular Assist Device Therapy Using Continuous Flow. Alternatives have emerged for patients ineligible for cardiac transplantation under standard criteria. The purpose of our study was to compare outcomes in patients ineligible for cardiac transplantation under standard criteria, treated either with extended criteria cardiac transplantation (ECCT) or a continuous flow destination therapy left ventricular assist device (CF DT-LVAD). From 2005 to 2012, patients treated with either ECCT or CF DT-LVAD at our institution were retrospectively analyzed. In the overall unmatched cohort, we examined mortality and other outcomes, including index hospitalization length of stay, renal function, stroke, and readmission rates. After propensity score (PS) matching, outcomes were compared between ECCT and CF DT-LVAD recipients. Overall, 62 patients underwent ECCT, and 146 patients were treated with CF DT-LVAD. The 2-year mortality estimate for ECCT recipients was 27.3% (95% confidence interval 15.5% to 39.1%) and for CF DT-LVAD recipients was 11.2% (95% confidence interval 4.8% to 17.6%). After PS matching of 39 patients from each treatment group, there was no significant difference in overall survival after 2 years (p = 0.346). In both unmatched and PS-matched analyses, CF DT-LVAD patients compared with ECCT had a significantly higher estimated glomerular filtration rate at 1 year but also had significantly higher hospital readmission rates. Stroke also more commonly occurred after CF DT-LVAD compared with ECCT (17 vs 5, unmatched; and 2 vs 1, PS matched). However, there was no significant difference between PS-matched groups in 2-year stroke-free survival (p = 0.371). In conclusion, ECCT and CF DT-LVAD in select patients are comparable therapies with respect to 2-year survival.
