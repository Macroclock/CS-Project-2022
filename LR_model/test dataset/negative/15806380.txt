Extracellular matrix proteins and matrix metalloproteinases differ between various right and left ventricular sites in end-stage cardiomyopathies. This study was undertaken to investigate whether there might be differences in the distribution of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), depending on their specific sites within the heart. We investigated 33 explanted human hearts, 15 with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and 18 with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM). Transmural samples from the right ventricle, the interventricular septum and the left ventricle, either from near the apex or from near the base were taken from every heart. Frozen sections were processed for connective tissue staining and immunohistochemistry for collagens type I, III, IV, laminin and fibronectin, as well as MMP-1, -2 and -9. Volume densities of laminin in ICM as well as of fibronectin and collagen types I and IV in DCM showed significant differences between right and left ventricular sites. The volume densities of matrix proteins usually did not reveal significant differences among the three left ventricular sites tested in both DCM and ICM. MMPs partly showed differences between the right and the left ventricular myocardium. These results suggest that the distributions of ECM proteins and MMPs differ between the two ventricles in both end-stage DCM and ICM. This gives rise to the hypothesis that a specific pattern of ECM degradation exists in the right and left ventricular myocardium.
