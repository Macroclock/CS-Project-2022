BAFF binding to T cell-expressed BAFF-R costimulates T cell proliferation and alloresponses. Binding of the TNF family member, B cell activating factor (BAFF), to its receptor (BAFF-R, TNFRSF13C) is required for generation and maintenance of mature B cells, but there are no data as to any role for the BAFF/BAFF-R pathway in T cell functions. We report that the binding of BAFF to BAFF-R expressed by a subset of primarily CD4(+) T cells costimulates T cell activation and allo-proliferation in vitro and in vivo, and that mice with a mutation in the BAFF-R, or with a targeted deletion of BAFF, show prolonged cardiac allograft survival as compared to wild-type or transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI)(-/-) controls. Taken together, these data indicate the BAFF/BAFF-R pathway contributes to both T and B cell responses and may be an attractive target for control of acute and chronic allograft rejection.
