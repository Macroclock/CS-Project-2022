Noninfectious constrictive pericarditis in a heart transplant recipient. Acute rejection, infection, and allograft coronary artery disease have been recognized as the major causes of postoperative morbidity and mortality in cardiac transplant patients. More recently, pericardial and mediastinal complications have been recognized as a more common complication than previously believed. We describe a case of a heart transplant recipient admitted for apparent congestive heart failure exacerbation who was unresponsive to standard medical management of congestive heart failure and rejection. After further invasive evaluation, it was discovered the patient's condition was attributable to posttransplantation constrictive pericarditis. It is appropriate to consider this diagnosis in any postcardiac surgery (especially heart transplant recipients) in patients presenting with congestive heart failure exacerbations refractory to usual medical management.
