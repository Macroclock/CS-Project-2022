Malignant arrhythmias secondary to a cardiac fibroma requiring transplantation in a teenager. We report a case of a 13-year old girl with a diagnosis of cardiac fibroma who was followed for a decade. Although she was predominantly asymptomatic over this time period, she eventually developed significant ventricular arrhythmias. The arrhythmias were originally treated with anti-arrhythmic medications along with an automatic internal cardioverter-defibrillator. However, a nearly fatal event prompted a cardiac transplantation. This represents a unique case of a patient with cardiac fibroma who was bridged to transplantation with an internal cardioverter-defibrillator.
