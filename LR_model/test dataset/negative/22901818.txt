Priapism in an infant with sickle cell trait after cardiac transplant. We report a case of priapism in a 6-month-old boy of African descent who had been receiving intravenous sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor. An orthotopic cardiac transplantation had been performed at 6 months of age, 2 months after he had received a Berlin heart. The pre-, peri-, and postoperative care required multiple transfusions, and postoperative pulmonary hypertension required treatment with intravenous sildenafil. He developed a series of prolonged, semitumescent erections (30-180 minutes) that resolved spontaneously without the need for urologic intervention. Subsequent investigations revealed he was a carrier of a sickle cell gene. Although the precise etiology of the prolonged penile erection is unclear, it was likely secondary to the use of sildenafil and the sickle cell trait.
