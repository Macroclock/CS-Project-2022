Anthracycline-related toxicity requiring cardiac transplantation in long-term disease-free survivors with acute promyelocytic leukemia. We describe three cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with long-term disease-free survival who developed congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring cardiac transplantation. All three patients presented late-onset cardiotoxicity. Cardiac failure occurred progressively after 31-month, 32-month, and 14-month intervals, respectively, following completion of first anthracycline therapy. Cumulative anthracycline doses were 585 mg of daunorubicin and 64 mg of mitoxantrone in case 1, 1779 mg of daunorubicin in case 2, and 825 mg of daunorubicin in case 3. The questions relating to the pathogenesis of cardiac failure are discussed. We also discuss the prophylactic measures required for such treatment-related side effects.
