The future is here: ventricular assist devices for the failing heart. Mechanical circulatory support is an important adjunct to the management of patients with advanced heart failure. Technological advances in this area have improved overall survival and decreased the incidence of complications. In addition, they have expanded the population suitable for this therapy. The challenge for clinicians is to translate the clinical evidence into the selection of the most appropriate device that will benefit an individual patient. This paper will review ventricular assist devices currently available and their clinical indications.
