Waitlist and post-transplant outcomes for eisenmenger syndrome: A comparison of transplant strategies. End-stage Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) due to unrepaired atrial septal defect (ASD) or ventricular septal defect (VSD) is an indication for lung transplantation (LTx) or heart-lung transplantation (HLTx). Limited evidence exists as to the optimal transplant strategy for this unique population. To describe waitlist characteristics and post-transplant outcomes in patients with ES-ASD or ES-VSD. Using the ISHLT Registry, data were extracted for all ES-ASD or ES-VSD patients who underwent transplantation between 1987 and 2018. Additional data were sought for patients listed for LTx or HLTx in the OPTN Registry during the same period. Early era was defined as 1987-2004, and current era was defined as 2005-2018. In the current era, patients with ES-ASD or ES-VSD represented a lessening proportion of all LTx and HLTx. Compared to LTx for other indications, the odds of transplantation were significantly less for both ES-ASD 0.18 [0.07-0.50] and ES-VSD 0.03 [0.004-0.22]. In the early era, an equivalent survival was observed for ES-ASD who underwent HLTx versus LTx (p = 0.47), and superior survival for ES-VSD (p = 0.015). In contrast, ES-ASD patients who underwent LTx from the current era displayed better survival compared with HLTx, 10-year survival 52% vs 30% p = 0.036. Similar survival were observed for ES-VSD for both transplant strategies (p = 0.68). LTx shows superior survival outcomes in the current era for ES ASD patients, and equivalent outcomes for ES-VSD. In the current era, ES-ASD or ES-VSD patients were less likely to be transplanted than other candidates for LTx.
