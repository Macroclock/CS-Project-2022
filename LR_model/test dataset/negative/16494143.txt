The use of recombinant activated factor VII for refractory bleeding post complex cardiothoracic surgery. We reviewed the outcome following use of recombinant activated factor VII (rVIIa) in patients with major bleeding post cardiothoracic surgery in our unit between January 2002 and July 2004. The unit consists of 16 cardiothoracic intensive care beds in a public metropolitan teaching hospital which serves as a referral centre for heart and lung transplant surgery. Patients with refractory bleeding following cardiothoracic surgical procedures who were treated with rVIIa were identified. A total of 12 episodes of rVIIa use were recorded in ten patients, including three episodes with ventricular assist devices, and 5 heart and/or lung transplants. The median dose used was 85 microg/kg. Chest tube drainage decreased in all patients following administration of rVlIIa; median chest tube drainage decreased from 445 ml/h to 171 ml/h (P = 0.03). Despite cessation of bleeding, mortality was high when rVIIa was used after more than 24 hours. In six episodes, despite early rVIIa use (within six hours), continued bleeding necessitated return to theatre, where a surgical source of bleeding was found. In this small retrospective study, rVIIa significantly reduced bleeding that was refractory to standard blood product transfusion. In this series of patients, those that did not respond to rVIIa early in the postoperative phase were found to have a surgical source of bleeding.
