Heart transplantation in patients with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy: case reports. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is an hereditary syndrome characterized by slow but progressive locomotor involvement and cardiomyopathy. Cardiac impairment is often the life-limiting feature of the illness.
