Two De Novo Mutations in an Autistic Child Who Had Previously Undergone Transplantation for Dilated Cardiomyopathy: The Importance of Keeping an Open Mind. We report the finding of 2 de novo mutations in an 8-year-old boy with developmental delay and autism who underwent heart transplantation at 1 year of age for idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. We identified a de novo microdeletion at chromosome 2p16.3 involving the neurexin-1 (NRXN1) gene and a de novo pathologic variant (Pro838Leu) in the myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7) gene. This case emphasizes the importance of comprehensive genetic evaluation in patients with cardiomyopathy, particularly if they have extracardiac abnormalities, and the necessity of interpreting variants with attention to the phenotype. A complete genetic diagnosis may require multiple testing modalities.
