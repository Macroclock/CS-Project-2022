Is there a correlation between brain naturietic peptide levels and echocardiographic and hemodynamic parameters in heart transplant patients? Brain naturietic peptide (BNP) elevations have been reported in heart transplant patients both at baseline and during rejection. An association between BNP levels and certain echocardiographic and hemodynamic abnormalities has also been found in nontransplanted heart disease patients. We sought to determine whether BNP values were correlated with echocardiographic and hemodynamic parameters among a large cohort of heart transplant patients. We studied 71 consecutive heart transplant patients, excluding combined grafts, retransplants, and pediatric cases. We performed 488 BNP determinations during catheterization and within 48 hours of echocardiography. Hemodynamic parameters included mean pulmonary artery pressure, right ventricular systolic and diastolic pressures. Doppler echocardiography parameters were wall thickness, ventricular mass, left and right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, isovolumic relaxation time, and mitral flow deceleration time. We observed significant correlations between BNP values and left ventricular size, ventricular mass, and a restrictive filling pattern. BNP levels were also significantly correlated with right ventricular size, mean pulmonary artery pressure, and right ventricular diastolic and end-diastolic pressures. In heart transplant patients, BNP levels positively correlated with ventricular diameters and a restrictive filling pattern. An increase in right ventricle and pulmonary artery pressures was associated with elevated BNP values.
