[Cardiac surgery--2005]. The demand of the patients and the society, the results of basic sciences and industrial developments besides the judgement of the surgeon determine the evolution of cardiac surgery. The authors review the actual questions of the main disciplines in cardiac surgery. Outcomes of coronary artery surgery are detailed, on what the new interventional techniques have enormous influence. In the valvular surgery the spreading of plastic surgical procedures and stentless valve implantation is to be expected. According to the international surveys the amount of heart transplantation stagnates. The usage of long- and short-term mechanical support devices is neccessitated. The minimally invasive techniques associated with less operative injury can be performed safely with appropriate experience in selected patients. The prevention of perioperative brain damage is also considered an important issue, and several refinements are tested. Actually we are in the phase of acquiring experience; however, it can be compared to "shooting a moving target" due to the continuous developments.
