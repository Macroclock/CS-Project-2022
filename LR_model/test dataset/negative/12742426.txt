Transcatheter closure of residual atrial septal defect after cardiac transplantation. A 55-year-old male patient experienced 2 acute neurologic events 3 weeks after orthotopic cardiac transplantation. Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated a patent foramen ovale in the native portion of the interatrial septum with bidirectional shunting by Doppler and microbubble contrast. The defect was closed successfully with a CardioSeal transcatheter septal closure device. This case demonstrates the advantages of the percutaneous approach for closure of residual defects in the post-operative patient.
