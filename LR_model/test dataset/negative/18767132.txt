Assessment of graft function in rodent models of heart transplantation. Heterotopic heart transplantation in rats and mice is the most commonly used model to study allograft immune response and to test immunosuppressive drugs and tolerance induction protocols. Standardization of both the surgical procedure and the evaluation of graft function is essential for data interpretation. The most popular way to monitor graft function has been the palpation method. However, there are some proposal for more objective assessment methods like electrocardiogram and echocardiogram. Although, complementary tests might add some relevant information when assessing minor effects of immunosuppressive therapy, palpation by an experienced investigator is very predictive and so far the simplest method to determine heart allograft function. Minor complications during the surgical procedure and unreliable assessment can have a major impact on the interpretation of experiment results. Here, the author reviews the literature and presents some suggestions that help eliminating biases on the assessment of heart allograft function.
