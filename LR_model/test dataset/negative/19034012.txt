Effects of selective phosphodiesterase-5-inhibition on myocardial contractility and reperfusion injury after heart transplantation. Recently, the infarct reducing and cardioprotective effects of phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitors were described. In this study, we investigated these effects on ischemia/reperfusion injury in a rat model of heart transplantation. Three groups were assigned for our study: a vardenafil preconditioning group, an ischemic control, and a nonischemic control. Hemodynamic parameters were significantly increased in the vardenafil group (Pmax: 82+/-4 vs. 110+/-12 vs. 127+/-13 mm Hg; dP/dtmax: 1740+/-116 vs. 3197+/-599 vs. 4397+/-602 mm Hg/sec; ischemic control vs. vardenafil vs. nonischemic control; P<0.05 vs. ischemic control). Furthermore, we recorded increased ATP levels and significantly less apoptosis in the treatment group after terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (apoptosis index: 27.23%+/-1.54% vs. 16.77%+/-1.42% vs. 18.86%+/-1.07%; ischemic control vs. vardenafil vs. nonischemic control; P<0.05 vs. ischemic control). Our current results support the concept that the cGMP-PKG-pathway plays an important role in ischemia/reperfusion injury. We could show that up-regulating this pathway has a preconditioning-like effect and can effectively reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury.
