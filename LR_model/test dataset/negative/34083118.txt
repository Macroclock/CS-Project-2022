The impact of donor sex on heart transplantation outcomes-a study of over 60,000 patients in the United States. The impact of donor sex on heart transplantation outcomes irrespective of recipient sex remains unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of donor sex on heart transplantation outcomes in the United States. From 1987 to March 2019, 63,775 adult patients who underwent heart transplantation were matched to 27,509 male and 11,474 female donors in the United States. Data were prospectively collected by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). Patients without missing data were stratified by donor sex and donor menopause status. The groups were matched 1:1 using the propensity score of each patient. Kaplan-Meier survival and cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints were postoperative complications. Propensity matching generated 15,506 and 1,094 patients based on donor sex and menopause status, respectively. Recipients who received female donor allografts were more likely to have acute rejection episodes requiring anti-rejection medical treatment (11.9% vs 10.1%, p = .007) and require post-transplant dialysis (10.9% vs 9.3%, p = .001) than those who received male donor allografts. Overall survival using female vs male donor allografts was similar (p = .34). Recipients who received pre- vs post-menopausal female donor hearts had similar postoperative outcomes and overall survival (p = .23). Analysis of the UNOS database showed similar median survival using female vs male donor hearts in adult heart transplantation, irrespective of donor menopause status. Female donor allografts are used far less frequently, thus these results represent an opportunity to maximize usage by better utilization of suitable female donor organs.
