Doppler echocardiography in advanced systolic heart failure: a noninvasive alternative to Swan-Ganz catheter. Although several studies have demonstrated a good correlation between Doppler echocardiographic and invasive measurements of single hemodynamic variables, the accuracy of echocardiography in providing a comprehensive assessment in individual patients has not been validated. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy and clinical applicability of Doppler echocardiography in determining the entire hemodynamic profile in stable patients with advanced systolic heart failure. Doppler echocardiography and Swan-Ganz catheterization were simultaneously performed in 43 consecutive patients with advanced heart failure. Echocardiographic data required for estimation of right atrial, pulmonary artery systolic, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures; cardiac output; and pulmonary vascular resistance were obtained and compared with hemodynamic data. For all variables, invasive and noninvasive hemodynamic values were highly correlated (P<0.0001), with very low bias and narrow 95% confidence limits. In 16 patients with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (>3 Wood U) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (>20 mm Hg) at baseline, hemodynamic and Doppler measurements were simultaneously repeated after unloading manipulations. Absolute values and changes of pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures after unloading were still accurately predicted (r =0.96 and r =0.92, respectively). Doppler echocardiography may offer a valid alternative to invasive cardiac catheterization for the comprehensive hemodynamic assessment of patients with advanced heart failure, and it may assist in monitoring and optimization of therapy in potential heart transplant recipients.
