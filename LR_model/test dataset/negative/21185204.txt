Twenty-five-year survival after heart-lung transplantation: a milestone. Limited information about long-term survivors of heart-lung transplant recipients exists. We report a 57-year-old man who has now survived 25 years after a heart-lung transplant. Initial induction and maintenance immunotherapy was rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin, cyclosporine, azathioprine, and methylprednisolone. This patient is currently alive and working 25 years later and has continued good function of the heart-lung graft,without evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans.
