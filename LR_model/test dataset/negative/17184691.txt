Bridge to transplantation with a left ventricular assist device for systemic ventricular failure after Mustard procedure. After Mustard or Senning procedures, transplantation remains the only option for some patients who present at late stage with severe systemic (right) ventricular failure. In some circumstances these patients may require urgent mechanical circulatory support to bridge them to transplantation. The use of mechanical support poses considerable potential and actual specific problems both in terms of insertion and management of the device. We report the case of a 17-year-old patient who had a left ventricular assist device implanted from the right ventricle to the aorta for "end-stage" heart failure 15 years after the Mustard procedure. The specific problems are discussed and a management scheme is proposed.
