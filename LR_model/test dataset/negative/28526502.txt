Hemodynamic parameters predict adverse outcomes following biventricular conversion with single-ventricle palliation takedown. Patients with a borderline left ventricular hypoplasia in the hypoplastic left heart syndrome variant or an unbalanced atrioventricular canal who undergo initial single-ventricle palliation may be candidates for biventricular (BiV) conversion following left ventricle (LV) recruitment procedures. We investigated associations among preoperative parameters and postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing BiV conversion. We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent BiV conversion to determine variables associated with clinical outcomes. Predictor variables included cardiac diagnosis, age and weight, LV dimension, LV end diastolic volume, LV mass, preoperative LV end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and preoperative left atrial pressure. Primary outcome was a composite of death, heart transplant, or BiV takedown. Of 51 patients, 11 experienced primary outcome (22%). Patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome variant were more likely to experience primary outcome than those with an unbalanced atrioventricular canal (30% vs 6%; P = .03). Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that preoperative LVEDP had good predictive accuracy in classifying patients with and without the primary outcome (area under the curve, 0.757; 95% confidence interval, 0.594-0.919; P = .012). The Youden J-index indicated a cutoff of LVEDP ≥ 13 mm Hg as optimal for predicting the primary outcome. Multivariable Cox regression demonstrated that LVEDP ≥ 13 mm Hg (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.00; P = .037) and postoperative right ventricle pressure > 3/4 (adjusted hazard ratio, 21.75; P < .001) were significantly associated with primary outcome, independent of age, weight, and diagnosis. Elevated preoperative LVEDP is a risk factor for suboptimal postoperative hemodynamic parameters and adverse outcome following BiV conversion from single-ventricle palliation.
