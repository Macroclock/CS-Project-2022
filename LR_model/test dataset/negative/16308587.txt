Canadian Consensus on cardiac transplantation in pediatric and adult congenital heart disease patients 2004: executive summary. Cardiac transplantation is an acceptable therapeutic option for the pediatric age group and for adult patients with congenital heart disease. There are a myriad of clinical diagnoses in these two patient populations. Survival has continued to improve, with graft half-lives of 14 years and greater in pediatric heart transplantation patients. There are issues unique to these patient populations in relation to heart transplantation for which the present document summarizes the relevant literature and presents management guidelines. Donor availability remains a major limiting factor in organ transplantation at present. Efforts need to be made to increase organ donor awareness, identify potential donors and aggressively manage marginal donors. Indications for transplantation and determination of timing of listing continue to be challenging due to a lack of evidence-based guidelines specifically for prognostic indices of outcome and pretransplant survival. The current status system for listing patients for transplantation does not necessarily reflect the typical clinical course of deterioration experienced by these two patient populations; therefore, consideration needs to be given to a parallel listing strategy. Evidence is accumulating pointing to an advantage to performing transplantations in patients in early infancy. ABO-incompatible heart transplantation has lead to a reduction in waiting time and waiting list mortality. Care of children after heart transplantation must take into consideration physical growth and multisystem development; stage of immunological maturation; intellectual, emotional and social maturation; educational activities; and other pediatric quality of life parameters. Post-transplantation issues are somewhat different, including rejection, coronary artery disease, malignancies and infections. Efforts need to be made to support multicentre trials to determine optimal treatment protocols.
