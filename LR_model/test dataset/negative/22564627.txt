The smell of Tokishakuyaku-san (TJ-23) induces generation of regulatory T cells and prolongation of survival of fully allogeneic cardiac grafts in mice. Oral administration of Tokishakuyaku-san (TJ-23), a Japanese herbal medicine, induces prolongation of cardiac allograft survival and generates regulatory cells in mice. Because herbal medicines usually have unique odor, and because smell is supposed to modulate the immune system, we examined whether the odor of TJ-23 induced prolonged allograft survival and regulatory cell generation. Naïve CBA mice (H2(k)) and olfactory-dysfunctional CBA mice after a stereotaxic operation underwent transplantation of C57BL/6 (B6, H2(b)) hearts, receiving fumigated water only or TJ-23 until rejection. Untreated or treated with water fumigation CBA mice rejected B6 cardiac grafts acutely (median survival times [MSTs], 7 and 8.5 days). When CBA mice were treated with fumigation of TJ-23, allograft survival was significantly prolonged (MST, 48 days). Olfactory-dysfunctional CBA mice treated with fumigation of TJ-23 rejected grafts acutely (MST, 7 days). Treatment with fumigation of TJ-23 also suppressed splenocytes proliferation and interferon-γ production. Secondary CBA recipients of whole splenocytes or CD4(+) cells from primary TJ-23-treated CBA recipients of B6 cardiac allografts at 30 days after grafting showed prolonged survival of B6 hearts (MST, >60 days). Flow cytometry studies showed increased CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory cells in recipients given fumigation of TJ-23. In conclusion naïve but not olfactory-dysfunctional CBA mice treated with fumigation of TJ-23 displayed prolonged survival of fully allogeneic cardiac allografts and generation of regulatory cells.
