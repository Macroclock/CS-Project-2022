Who gets a second heart? A current picture of cardiac retransplantation. Heart retransplantation (HRT) accounts for 2.6% of heart transplantation (HT) indications. We performed a retrospective analysis of our recent HRT experience. From January 2000 to June 2012, 820 HTs were performed; 798 (97.3%) were primary HTs and 21 (2.5%) 2nd HTs. Indications for HRT included: 57% cardiac allograft vasculopathy, 33% nonspecific graft failure, 5% primary graft failure (PGF), and 5% refractory acute rejection. The primary outcome was overall survival. Our results were compared with the most representative publications reporting HRT experiences before January 2000. Mean age at HRT was 39.9 Â± 14.3 years, and there was a predominance of male patients (62%). Overall mortality was 52%; 30-day mortality was 19%. Eight patients (38%) developed PGF after HRT and 3 of them (38%) died within 30 days. Overall actuarial survivals at 1 month and 1, 3, and 5 years were 81.0%, 70.8%, 59.9%, and 53.3%, respectively. No significant risk factors for mortality could be identified. We observed improved short- and medium-term survival after HRT. This finding is probably related to changing recipient profiles, with less patients being retransplanted for PGF and more patients undergoing late retransplantation. Higher rates of PGF after HRT reflect our efforts to broaden the allograft pool by using marginal donors.
