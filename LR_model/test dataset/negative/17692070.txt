Treatment of Candida albicans pericarditis in a heart transplant patient. Pericarditis due to Candida species is a rare clinical entity, associated with thoracic surgery and immunosuppression. We report here the second case of pericarditis due to Candida albicans in a heart transplant patient, which presented as tamponade approximately 3 weeks post transplant, in the absence of evidence of sternal osteomyelitis. The patient was treated with pericardiocentesis and a combination of caspofungin and fluconazole, but the patient ultimately required the explantation of retained epicardial leads and the creation of a pericardial window. This case illustrates that Candida species must be considered in the differential diagnosis in post-transplant pericarditis, and that foreign body removal is, as always, key in helping to resolve such infections. This case also demonstrates the first use of caspofungin with fluconazole to treat Candida pericarditis. We discuss the conflicting data regarding the use of caspofungin, alone or in combination therapy, in treating infections involving biofilms, such as the infected pericardium.
