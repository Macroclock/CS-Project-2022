HCV-Positive Allograft Use in Heart Transplantation Is Associated With Increased Access to Overdose Donors and Reduced Waitlist Mortality Without Compromising Outcomes. Because of ongoing shortages of donors for heart transplantation, the use of donor candidates whose availabilities are the result of drug overdoses (ODs) has become increasingly prevalent, even though these donors carry a high preponderance of the now curable hepatitis C virus (HCV). This study investigated temporal trends and regional variabilities in HVC-positive (HCV+) allograft use in heart transplantation and assessed the relationship between the use of HCV+ graft donors and the use of OD donors as well as assessing waitlist and post-transplant outcomes. A retrospective review of the United Network for Organ Sharing database assessed adults listed for heart transplantation. Patients were stratified both temporally into pre-HCV and HCV eras related to HCV+ graft use trends and regionally by degree of HCV+ allograft use. Regions of high HCV+ donor use were associated with an increase in OD donor access by 7.8% across eras compared to 0.4% in low HCV+ donor-use regions. One-year waitlist mortality decreased from 4.7% to 2.5% across eras in high HCV+ donor-use regions (P= 0.001) and remained roughly the same as before in low HCV+ donor-use regions (3.0% vs 2.4%; P= 0.244.). Post-transplant survival at 1 year remained similar across eras. HCV+ donor allograft use can help to optimize donor use, decreasing waitlist mortality without compromising early survival. Ongoing assessment is essential to ensure long-term safety and efficacy of using HCV+ donors. 'Hepatitis C virus', 'drug overdose', 'heart transplantation', 'waitlist mortality'
