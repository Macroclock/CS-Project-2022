Over-expression of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) preventing cold ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury in heart transplantation through Foxo3a signaling. Ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury which inevitably occurs during heart transplantation is the major factor leading to organ failure and graft rejection. In order to develop new therapies to prevent I/R injury, we used both a murine heart transplantation model with 24 hour cold I/R and an in vitro cell culture system to determine whether growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a protective factor in preventing I/R injury in heart transplantation and to further investigate underlying mechanisms of I/R injury. We found that cold I/R caused severe damage to the endocardium, epicardium and myocardium of heart grafts from wild type C57BL/6 mice, whereas grafts from GDF15 transgenic (TG) mice showed less damage as demonstrated by decreased cell apoptosis/death, decreased neutrophils infiltration and the preservation of the normal structure of the heart. Over-expression of GDF15 reduced expression of phosphorylated RelA p65, pre-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic genes while it enhanced Foxo3a phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. Over-expression of GDF15 inhibited cell apoptosis/death and reduced neutrophil infiltration. In conclusion, this study, for the first time, demonstrates that GDF15 is a promising target for preventing cold I/R injury in heart transplantation. This study also shows that the resultant protective effects are mediated by the Foxo3 and NFÎºB signaling pathways. 'Foxo3a', 'GDF15', 'heart transplantation', 'ischemia reperfusion injury'
