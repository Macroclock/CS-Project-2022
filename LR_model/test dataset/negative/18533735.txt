Device therapy for heart failure: when and for whom? Surgical approaches to heart failure (HF) management have become a necessary strategy in response to a waiting list that is expanding in the face of a limited supply of organ donors. Multiple studies have supported the safety and efficacy of device-based therapy. Among the device-based therapy options, ventricular assist devices (VADs) represent an alternative to heart transplantation with the capability to function as short-term support, bridge-to-transplantation or recovery and as long-term support. VAD support may be considered in those with refractory cardiogenic shock or those with decompensated chronic HF that is unresponsive to maximized medical therapy. Composite scoring scales may be used to risk-stratify patients using clinical and laboratory values to allow more systematic patient selection. As the pursuit for a perfect device continues, so does the search for the best objective index to guide referral. Technologic advances will enhance device performance and extend VAD use into community practice. This discussion aims to highlight criteria for candidate selection and referral for VAD implantation.
