Immunoperoxidase staining for C4d on paraffin-embedded tissue in cardiac allograft endomyocardial biopsies: comparison to frozen tissue immunofluorescence. C4d deposition in microvasculature is a marker for humoral rejection. The authors compared a recently developed C4d immunoperoxidase (IP) method for paraffin-embedded tissue to immunofluorescence (IF) of frozen tissue. Of 315 frozen endomyocardial biopsies with IF staining for C4d, 280 were negative and 35 were positive. Negative controls were 17 negative biopsies and 11 biopsies with myocyte necrosis. The extent of IP and IF staining was graded as 0 to 3+. Staining intensity and the number and type of positive vessels were recorded. Staining patterns in Quilty lesions (QL) and foci of acute cellular rejection (ACR) were also evaluated. In 34 biopsies with sufficient tissue, IP criteria of 2+/3+, or more than 10 to 20 positive vessels per 10 high-power fields detected 25.0% (1/4), 18.2% (2/11), and 84.2% (16/19) of 1+, 2+, and 3+ IF-positive biopsies, respectively, without false positives. Considering C4d IF 3+ as positive resulted in 84.2% (16/19) sensitivity and 93.0% specificity (40/43). Intensely stained capillaries predominated in six of seven biopsies when more than 100 capillaries per 10 high-power fields were positive. Seventy percent (7/10) of IP 2+ and 3+ biopsies showed positive capillaries in QLs, while 36.4% (4/11) of IP 1+ and negative biopsies did. All eight IP 2+/3+ biopsies showed positive capillaries in ACR foci, while 25.0% (1/4) of IP-negative biopsies did. Capillary staining in QLs and areas of ACR reflects overall C4d deposition. In conclusion, IP staining of 2+/3+ is highly sensitive and specific for C4d positivity. The authors recommend considering 2+ and 3+ as positive staining when using the IP technique.
