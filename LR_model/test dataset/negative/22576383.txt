Treatment of left main coronary artery stenosis with drug-eluting stent following heart transplantation. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is the leading cause of death after the first year of heart transplantation. The optimal treatment for unprotected left main coronary artery disease in orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) patients is unknown. Two OHT patients with left main disease following heart transplantation underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Technical success was achieved in the patients with drug-eluting stents inserted to cover the lesions in the left main coronary artery. After 16 months follow-up, one patient died of multiorgan failure, the other was alive and free from myocardial infarction or target vessel revascularization. We conclude that the unprotected PCI for the left main coronary artery stenosis in transplanted heart is feasible.
