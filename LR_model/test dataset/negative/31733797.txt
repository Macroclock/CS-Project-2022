Cost and Factors Associated With the Hospitalization of Patients Undergoing Heart Transplantation. The aim of the study was to describe the cost and factors associated with the hospitalization of patients undergoing heart transplantation. A cross-sectional, descriptive study with a quantitative approach developed at an important heart transplant center in southern Brazil. Twenty patients who had undergone transplantation during the period 2007 to 2016 were included in the study. Central tendency measures and values presented as mean Â± SD or median and quartiles were calculated. Multiple linear regression was performed to verify the variables that interfered with the cost. The cost of hospitalization of patients undergoing heart transplantation was $522,997.26 in Brazilian reals ($220,002.58 in US dollars). The Brazilian public health system was responsible for paying the hospital bill of all patients. Female sex, patients up to 40 years of age, and length of stay in the hospital units were variables that were related to the highest values for the hospital service. Clinical complications of the patients during the hospitalization period were also factors that were related to the greater length of stay in the hospitalization units, reflecting higher expenses for the health institution. There is a need for health managers to implement strategies that will minimize complications, such as health care-related infections, that can be prevented during hospitalization and to stimulate the allocation of resources in order to improve care and reduce hospital expenses.
