Short-term mechanical circulatory support devices as bridge to heart transplantation: A prospective single-center experience in Argentina. Patients with cardiogenic shock may require hemodynamic stabilization with short-term mechanical circulatory support devices (ST-MCS) such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and centrifugal pump (CP) as bridge to transplantion (BTT). This study aimed to describe ECMO and CP during BTT and after heart transplant. A cohort of patients on ECMO or CP as BTT between April 2006 and April 2018 in a single hospital. Thirty-seven consecutive patients with ECMO (n = 14) or CP (n = 23) were included. Acute kidney injury was more prevalent during CP (28.6% vs 69.6%, P = .02). There were no differences in stroke, thrombosis, sepsis, or vasoplegia. Bleeding (0% vs 56.5%, P = .0003) and reoperation (0% vs 47.8%, P = .002) were more frequent in CP group as well as mortality (0 vs 7 [30.4%], P = .03). The remaining 30 patients (81.1%) underwent heart transplantation, without differences in primary graft dysfunction, vasoplegia, reoperation for bleeding, or hospital stay. Mortality was 23.3% at 30 days, similar in both groups, with no further deaths at median follow-up of 44.2 months. In patients with cardiogenic shock, ST-MCS with ECMO or CP as BTT are a lifesaving approach allowing successful transplantation in the majority of cases, with good short- and long-term survival.
