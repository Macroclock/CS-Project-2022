Candida dubliniensis meningitis as delayed sequela of treated C. dubliniensis fungemia. We present a case of Candida dubliniensis meningitis that developed 2 months after apparently successful treatment of an episode of C. dubliniensis candidemia in a heart-lung transplant recipient in Australia. This case highlights the importance of follow-up in patients with candidemia or disseminated infection, especially in immunosuppressed patients.
