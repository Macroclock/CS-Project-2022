Reliability of QRS duration and morphology on surface electrocardiogram to identify ventricular dyssynchrony in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Using Fourier phase analysis of equilibrium radionuclide angiography in both ventricles, inter- and intraventricular delays were correlated with QRS morphology and duration in 103 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. We found that left bundle branch block on the left axis may reflect a high intra-left ventricular dyssynchrony. A precise evaluation of the dyssynchrony appears useful because a high proportion of patients with incomplete bundle branch block, left anterior hemiblock, or "normal" QRS exhibit a marked intra-LV dyssynchrony and may respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy.
