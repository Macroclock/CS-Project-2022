889 days of support on hydrodynamic bearing rotation mode of the DuraHeart™ for bridge-to-heart transplantation. A 49-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy and tricuspid regurgitation underwent a DuraHeart implantation and tricuspid annuloplasty for bridge-to-heart transplantation. On postoperative day 393, the magnetic levitation system suddenly broke down, and the pump system went into hydrodynamic bearing rotation (HD) mode without causing relevant symptoms. The controller was exchanged with one that adapted to the HD mode. No significant hemodynamic changes or indications of hemolysis were observed. On postoperative day 982, the pump temporarily stopped nine times. The patient refused pump exchange despite our strong recommendation for it. After 1283 days of DuraHeart support (889 days in HD mode) without hemolysis or neurologic events, he underwent heart transplantation. The DuraHeart manufacturer's analysis revealed much damage to the insulation and fatigue fractures of the conductors, which had resulted in temporary cessation of function and failure of the magnetic levitation system. This was a rare case of long-term support under the DuraHeart HD mode. 'Driveline fracture', 'DuraHeart', 'Hydrodynamic bearing rotation mode', 'LVAD'
