Evaluation of the SIPAT instrument to assess psychosocial risk in heart transplant candidates: A retrospective single center study. We evaluated the reliability of the Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplantation (SIPAT) in heart transplant (HT) recipients and explored its usefulness in predicting post-transplant outcomes. Pre-transplant psychosocial and behavioral risk is associated with post-transplant clinical outcomes. SIPAT is a risk assessment tool created for pre-transplant psychosocial evaluation. Via retrospective chart review, three examiners applied the SIPAT to 51 adult HT recipients. Examiners blinded to SIPAT scores extracted data and interviewed clinicians for one-year post-transplant outcomes. Analysis included Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), Pearson's correlation coefficient and Chi-square. SIPAT demonstrated strong inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.76-0.96). Compared to those with SIPAT ratings of "Excellent/Good", the "Minimally Acceptable Candidate/High Risk" group was more likely to miss clinic visits (p = 0.004). The SIPAT tool had strong IRR. Less favorable SIPAT ratings were associated with nonadherence to clinic visits. Further study is warranted to determine association of SIPAT ratings to clinical outcomes.
