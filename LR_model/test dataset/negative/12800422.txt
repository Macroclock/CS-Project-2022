[Effect of sappan wood on perforin mRNA expression in myocardium of rats after allogeneic cardiac transplantation]. To observe the effect of Sappan wood (SW) on the expression of perforin mRNA in myocardium of rats after allogeneic cardiac transplantation. The animal model of allogeneic (abdominal) cardiac transplantation was established by taking Wistar rat as provider and SD rat as receptor, perforin mRNA expression in the model's myocardium was detected by RT-PCR. SW could obviously reduce the perforin mRNA expression, it also could alleviate the pathological morphology and ultrastructural damage of myocardial cells. SW has obvious effect in antagonizing immune rejection after transplantation, the mechanism of its immunosuppression could be through lowering the perforin mRNA expression.
