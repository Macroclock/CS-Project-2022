Disseminated mucormycosis masquerading as rejection early after orthotopic heart transplantation. Mucorales organisms are an uncommon cause of invasive fungal infections after solid organ transplantation but are associated with great morbidity and mortality. We report a fatal case of disseminated Cunninghamella infection early after heart transplantation. The patient developed graft dysfunction and elevated markers of myocyte injury and autopsy revealed fulminant fungal myocarditis. This case highlights the need for a high index of suspicion in immunocompromised patients who are not improving with standard antimicrobial therapy.
