Comparison between a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay and a fluorescent polarization immunoassay to measure whole blood everolimus concentration in heart and renal transplantations. Various methods [fluorescent polarization immunoassay (FPIA) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay] are used for therapeutic drug monitoring of everolimus. The aim of this study is to compare these assays in renal and heart transplantation. The correlation between results was investigated by linear regression in 44 patients (24 heart recipients and 20 renal recipients--137 samples). The comparison between assays was performed by a paired t-test. A highly significant correlation was found between FPIA and LC-MS/MS in heart and renal recipients [FPIA=0.851 x LC-MS/MS+1.773r(2)=0.8738 (P<0.001)]. Paired t-tests did not show a significant difference between everolimus whole blood concentrations in the populations of heart and renal recipients or heart recipients or renal recipients. FPIA and LC-MS/MS assays gave consistent overall results although some significant differences were observed in some samples between these methods indicating that FPIA assay has limitations that deserve further investigations.
