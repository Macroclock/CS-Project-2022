Reversal of pulmonary hypertension in paediatric patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy. Left ventricular assist devices can reverse pulmonary hypertension in cardiac transplant candidates with heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction. Whether a similar approach is applicable in restrictive cardiomyopathy is uncertain. We report the successful implantation of a Medtronic HVAD left ventricular assist device in a bridge-to-candidacy concept in 2 paediatric patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy.
