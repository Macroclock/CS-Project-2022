Assessing historical compliance with medical recommendations among transplant candidates: preliminary findings. Noncompliance with medical recommendations by transplant candidates and recipients carries serious consequences for morbidity and mortality. Few patient-specific, objective measures for assessing historical compliance exist. To address this gap, a psychometric and exploratory analysis of an interview-based, global measure of clinician-rated judgment of historical compliance was undertaken. All findings are based on a retrospective chart review of the medical and psychosocial evaluations of 96 consecutive potential heart transplant candidates seen at a large Southeastern academic medical center. Preliminary results demonstrated adequate interrater reliability and discriminant validity for the measure. Additionally, results from hierarchical multivariable regression analysis revealed years of education to be positively associated with clinician-rated judgment of historical compliance. This study provides preliminary psychometric support for the use of a measure of historical compliance among heart transplant candidates. Findings from this study also are consistent with the literature to date and may be reflective of a psychobiological process that mediates the relationship between socioeconomic status and health outcomes.
