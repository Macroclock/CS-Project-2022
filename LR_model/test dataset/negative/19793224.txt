Bone mineral status in pediatric heart transplant recipients: a retrospective observational study of an "at risk" cohort. There is a paucity of literature assessing the burden of bone loss in PHT recipients. We sought to describe the bone mineral status in PHT recipients by doing a retrospective medical record review of those who underwent evaluation of BMD when clinically indicated. Data collected included patient demographics, BMD evaluations, serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, cumulative steroid dose, osseous complications and their management. Of 149 PHT recipients, 26 underwent BMD evaluation. This evaluation was done at a median of 3.4 yrs after PHT. There total serum calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase were similar at transplant and BMD study. The median BMD Z-scores were: whole body -0.09 (1.5 to -5.13) and lumbar spine -1.1 (1.5 to -5.16). Bone loss (Z-score <-1) was present in 14 (53.8%). Three patients had spinal fractures and/or avascular necrosis of various bones. Treatment included calcitrol and bisphosphonates; and vertebroplasty for spinal fracture. Bone loss was present in a significant proportion of PHT recipients and may be associated with fractures and avascular necrosis. More than half of our "at risk" cohort had bone loss. Careful surveillance of these patients should be performed to prevent morbidity.
