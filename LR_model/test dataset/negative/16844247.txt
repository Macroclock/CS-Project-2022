Orthotopic cardiac transplantation for the treatment of progressive heart failure caused by idiopathic giant cell myocarditis. We describe a patient with idiopathic giant cell myocarditis who underwent orthotopic cardiac transplantation. On triple immunosuppressive therapy including prednisone, cyclosporine and mycophenolate, the patient has not had recurrence of idiopathic giant cell myocarditis in the transplanted heart in 48 months of follow-up.
