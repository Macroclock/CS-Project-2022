Chagas cardiomyopathy and heart failure: From epidemiology to treatment. Chagas disease is among the neglected tropical diseases recognized by the World Health Organization that have received insufficient attention from governments and health agencies. Chagas disease is endemic in 21 Latin America regions. Due to globalization and increased migration, it has crossed borders and reached other regions including North America and Europe. The clinical presentation of the disease is highly variable, from general symptoms to severe cardiac involvement that can culminate in heart failure. Chagas heart disease is multifactorial, and can include dilated cardiomyopathy, thromboembolic phenomena, and arrhythmias that may lead to sudden death. Diagnosis is by methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the degree of cardiac involvement should be investigated with complementary exams including ECG, chest radiography and electrophysiological study. There have been insufficient studies on which to base specific treatment for heart failure due to Chagas disease. Treatment should therefore be derived from guidelines for heart failure that are not specific for this disease. Heart transplantation is a viable option with satisfactory success rates that has improved survival.
