Acute tamponade of the left paracorporeal pump house due to membrane defect in a patient with a Berlin Heart EXCOR biventricular assist device. We report a case of acute tamponade of the left paracorporeal pump house in a patient supported by a Berlin Heart EXCOR biventricular assist device (BiVAD) caused by mechanical defect in the membrane of the arterial chamber. A 36-year old male was admitted for composite graft surgery due to a large aortic regurgitation and consecutive heart failure, decompensated postoperatively and was rescued by with an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) device. He was accepted for heart transplantation, and a BiVAD (Berlin Heart EXCOR) was implanted as bridge-to-transplantation. Two months after discharge, he experienced dyspnoea and received error signals from his BiVAD. Relatives released him from his BiVAD companion driver, connected him to the hand pump and transported him to our institution. On arrival, he was in cardiogenic shock and was stabilized by ECMO. Inspection of the arterial chamber revealed a wear hole and delamination of the diaphragm, which had led to a tamponade by air insufflation into the three-layer membrane. New BiVAD paracorporeal pumps were connected, and the patient was subsequently successfully transplanted. The case depicts the difficulty of diagnosis in this specific patient setting. Despite transparent design of the BiVAD chambers, the development of a chamber tamponade remained undetected until explantation of the system.
