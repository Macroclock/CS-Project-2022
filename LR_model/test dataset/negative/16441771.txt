Glycine application and right heart function in a porcine heart transplantation model. Glycine reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury after experimental liver transplantation. We hypothesized that glycine might also protect right heart function in an isovolumic cardiac transplantation model. In six domestic donor pigs 150 ml of a 300 mmol L-glycine solution were administered intravenously. The hearts were then arrested with histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution. Animals without prior glycine infusion served as controls (n = 6). After 4 h of ischemia, hearts were transplanted into recipients. An isovolumic model was used in which the right ventricular (RV) volume was controlled in vivo using an intracavitary high-compliance balloon. After 1 and 2 h of reperfusion the RV balloon volume was gradually increased and the developed pressures were recorded (P(developed) = P(systolic) - P(diastolic)). Right ventricular failure was defined as a decrease in developed intracavitary pressure. Glycine hearts could be loaded with a significantly increased volume after 1 h (glycine: 53 +/- 13.7 ml vs. control: 32 +/- 11.7 ml; P = 0.015) and after 2 h (67 +/- 18.6 ml vs. 43 +/- 8.2 ml; P = 0.018). Maximal RV developed pressures were not significantly different between groups. Postischemic RV end-diastolic compliance was significantly higher in glycine-treated animals (P = 0.04). Glycine protects early postischemic RV compliance, but has no important influence on maximal developed pressures.
