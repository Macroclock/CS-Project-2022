Bicaval anastomosis in a heart transplant recipient with left superior vena cava. We describe the surgical procedure of orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) in a recipient with persistent left superior vena cava (LSVC) and isolated noncompaction of the left ventricle. The bicaval anastomosis technique was performed using and isolating his native coronary sinus to let the left superior vena cava drain into his own inferior vena cava through the native coronary sinus.
