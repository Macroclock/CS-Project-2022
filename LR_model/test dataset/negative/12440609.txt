Seventeen-year experience with 1,083 heart transplants at a single institution. Heart transplantation is the most accepted treatment for end-stage heart disease. A review of 1,083 consecutive transplants (1984 to 2001) was undertaken. Adult recipients were divided into quartiles. The last 540 transplants were combined. Three eras were created from these, 1984 to 1991, 1991 to 1995, and 1995 to 2001, with three age groups: 0 to 18 years, 19 to 61 years, and 62 to 74 years. All patients have at least 1 year of follow-up time. End points were survival, rejection, and graft coronary artery disease. There were 1,012 patients. Donor age, graft ischemic time, and the proportion of elderly recipients and nonstandard donor hearts have increased in the current era. Actuarial 60-month survivals of recipients after 1995 were 80.7% (0 to 18 years); 75.3% (19 to 61 years); and 76.2% (>62 years). The current era children and younger adult groups demonstrated improved results when compared with previous eras (p = 0.003 and p = 0.05). Rejection episodes equal to or greater than ISHLT grade 3A per person per year improved to 0.15 in the current era (p < 0.001). During the three eras, older recipients (>62 years) demonstrated fewer episodes of rejection when compared with other adults (0.13 versus 0.58, p = 0.03). Deaths attributed to graft coronary artery disease decreased from 11% to 5% from era 2 to era 3. Regression analysis revealed a mild effect of donor age on survival and graft coronary artery disease (hazard ratio = 1.02, p = 0.001; hazard ratio = 1.039, p < 0.001, respectively). Recipient predictors of graft coronary artery disease were diagnosis of ischemic cardiomyopathy (hazard ratio = 1.6, p = 0.014) and congenital heart disease (hazard ratio = 3.41, p = 0.02). Improved survival in the current era may be attributed to better organ preservation, improved immunosuppression and control of infection, and less life-threatening graft coronary artery disease.
