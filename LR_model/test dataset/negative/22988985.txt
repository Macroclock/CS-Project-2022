Fatal outcome after heart transplantation caused by Aspergillus lentulus. Opportunistic invasive fungal infections are a major cause of mortality in immunocompromised patients. Early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis and proper identification of the causative agent is crucial for guidance of therapy. Accurate differentiation of Aspergillus lentulus, a filamentous fungus often misidentified as atypical Aspergillus fumigatus, is of concern as multiple antifungal drugs show a reduced susceptibility. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of a proven pulmonary invasive fungal infection caused by A. lentulus after heart transplantation.
