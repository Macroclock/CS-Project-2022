Successful combined heart and kidney transplantation in a patient with sickle-cell anemia. Little is known about the management of dual-organ transplantation for sickle-cell disease (SCD)-related complications. In this case study, we report the successful outcome of combined heart and kidney transplantation in a patient with SCD. The recipient was a 33-year-old man with homozygous SCD, who developed end-stage heart and renal failure requiring combined heart and kidney transplantation. The patient was managed with pre-operative blood transfusion and moderate hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, with limited peri-operative complications. During the first 6 months there was one episode of acute heart rejection without concomitant renal rejection. Eighteen months after surgery, the patient is at home without vaso-occlusive crises or septic complications. Heart and renal allograft function is preserved, without coronary artery vasculopathy, but with asymptomatic moderate transplant renal artery stenosis. SCD is managed by periodic transfusion. This case study demonstrates that combined heart and kidney transplantation is feasible in patients with SCD. Careful attention to peri- and post-operative management is required.
