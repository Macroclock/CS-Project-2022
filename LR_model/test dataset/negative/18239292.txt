Novel method for selecting immunosuppressive histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors with minimal thrombocytopenia. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors repress interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene expression in T cells and possess immunosuppressive activity in vivo. In addition to its immunosuppressive activity, HDAC inhibitors block GATA binding protein-1 (GATA-1) gene expression in megakaryocytes and elicit thrombocytopenia. In this report we state that for a given immunosuppressive dose of HDAC inhibitor, the ratio of GATA-1 reporter gene activity relative to IL-2 reporter gene assay (G/I ratio of measured IC(50)) can be predictive of a HDAC inhibitor's thrombocytopenic effect. This study utilized nine HDAC inhibitors at a minimal effective dose in a rat heterotopic cardiac transplantation model and the resultant G/I ratios and platelet depletion rates were highly correlated (r=0.933). These results indicate that calculation of G/I ratio can be a novel method for selecting immunosuppressive HDAC inhibitor having minimal thrombocytopenic effect which will benefit the search for new immunosuppressants of greater safety and efficacy.
