Lobar displacement following pediatric heart-lung transplantation: case report and review of literature. Lobar displacement (LD) after heart-lung transplantation (HLT) has been reported in adults, but there are no reported pediatric cases. Its occurrence may cause vascular compromise of the displaced lung segment leading to necrosis, infection and bronchiectasis, as well as compression of contralateral lobes. We report two cases of LD in children following HLT, treated differently and with different outcomes. Assessment of pulmonary perfusion and weighing the risk of surgical repair may be considered for optimal patient management of this condition.
