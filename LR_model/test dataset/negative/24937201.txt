Comparative analysis of the quality of life for patients prior to and after heart transplantation. The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life of patients before and after heart transplantation (HTX). We included 63 patients after a heart transplant under the care of the Transplantation Clinic. The authors' questionnaire was used, which consisted of 2 parts: questions concerning the life of patients before and after a heart transplant. The significance level was p<0.05. In the group before the heart transplant, average quality of life (on a 10-point scale) was 3.16 ± 1.47 and in the group after the heart transplant this factor increased to 7.60 ± 1.21 (p<0.00001). Our study shows that after the heart transplant people consider their physical health to be better. In the group before the heart transplant, the average assessment of physical health on a scale from 1 to 5 was 2.079 ± 0.79 and after the heart transplant it was 4.10 ± 0.39 (p<0.0001). No statistically significant correlations were indicated between the quality of life after the heart transplant and the quality of life before the transplant, age, sex, and time elapsed after the heart transplant. There was a positive correlation between the assessment of quality of life and that of physical (r=0.53; p<0.05) and mental health (r=0.45; p<0.05). The study shows that the quality of life of patients after the heart transplant was significantly improved in all spheres of life under analysis: physical, mental, social, and family. The results of the study indicate that patients associated the quality of life with their physical and mental health status.
