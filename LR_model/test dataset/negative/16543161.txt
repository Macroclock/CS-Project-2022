Becker's muscular dystrophy and orthotopic heart transplantation: perioperative considerations. Patients with Becker's and Duchenne's muscular dystrophy occasionally have myocardial involvement leading to end-stage heart failure. Heart transplantation is established as an effective therapy. Achieving successful outcomes in this challenging group requires special consideration during the perioperative period to limit preoperative deconditioning, minimize anesthesia complications, and rapidly institute rehabilitation with appropriate precautions. We reviewed our recent experience with Becker's muscular dystrophy patients and discuss the management of perioperative issues specific to this patient group.
