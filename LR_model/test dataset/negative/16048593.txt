Heart transplantation: Literature review 2003-2004. The rapid expansion of the volume of peer reviewed publications in recent years, including a large increase in the number of new biomedical journals, makes it difficult for the practicing clinician to stay up to date with the medical literature. This is the first review in a new series that will provide succinct summaries of the recent medical literature in the field of pediatric transplantation. In this review, we summarize important articles in the field of pediatric heart transplantation that have been published over the last 2 years (2003, 2004). The review is intended to be comprehensive but not exhaustive.
