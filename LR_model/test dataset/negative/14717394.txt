Heart transplantation an answer for end-stage heart failure. Heart transplantation remains the best treatment option for end-stage heart failure. For patients who are not candidates for transplantation, better medical management and surgical options in heart failure can improve both the length and quality of a patient's life. Continuing research on xenotransplantation and the total artificial heart may decrease the need for human transplantation in years to come and may allow others with severe heart failure to have a chance at living longer.
