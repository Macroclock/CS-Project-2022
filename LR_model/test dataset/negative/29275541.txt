Human polyomavirus-7-associated eruption successfully treated with acitretin. Advances in molecular technologies have led to the discovery of several novel human polyomaviruses (HPyVs), including human polyomavirus-7 (HPyV-7). Although low levels of HPyV-7 are shed from apparently normal skin, recent reports have described clinically significant cutaneous infection in immunocompromised patients that manifests as generalized pruritic plaques. The pruritus can be severe, and treatment options have not been described. Herein we report HPyV-7 cutaneous infection in a heart transplant patient who experienced temporary improvement with intravenous cidofovir, and complete remission with acitretin. We report a case of HPyV-7 cutaneous infection demonstrating a good response to treatment.
