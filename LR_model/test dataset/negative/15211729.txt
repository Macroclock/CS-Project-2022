[Anxiety, depression, and stressed life in patients awaiting heart transplantation: are these factors to be considered?]. Heart transplantation is a therapeutic procedure in which biological, psychological, social and ethical aspects play an important role, none of them has to be underestimated. It is known that the waiting period up to heart transplantation is extremely stressful for patients and their families, causing psychopathological and disadaptive reactions. Aim of the present study was to investigate psychological tract characteristics, stress reactions and quality of life in a group of patients registered for heart transplantation. Sixty two patients (47 M, 15 F), with mean age of 53 +/- 9.9 years in NYHA class (16 class II, and 43 class III/IV) and ejection fraction 29 +/- 10 have filled in the following two questionnaires: the Cognitive Behavioural Assessment form H (CBA-H), to measure psychological functioning and/or behaviours at risk for heart disease, and the Short Form 36 (SF-36), to evaluate physical and functional health status. In patients awaiting heart transplantation, the presence of anxiety contributes to reduce physical activity, vitality and mental health. Depressed mood disorders negatively influence physical and mental health and vitality. Perception of stressed life limits role and physical activity, vitality, and emotional status and augments intensity of physical pain. Symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress influence negatively mental health and daily physical activity. These aspects may vary of intensity with progression of the disease and lengthening of waiting. The importance of an early and continuous psychological support to the patient becomes fundamental to individuate and treat these disorders to favour optimal post-transplant outcomes.
