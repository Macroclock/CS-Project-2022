Aortic dissection following heart transplantation. A 75-year-old male with a previous orthotopic heart transplantation performed 28 years ago was incidentally discovered to have an asymptomatic chronic type A aortic dissection. Catheter-induced dissection during coronary angiography was believed to be the culprit factor. Aortic root replacement and aortic valve reconstruction were successfully performed.
