[Heart transplantation for patients on high emergency list with or without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support]. Severely impaired patients may wait in France on a special and temporary high emergency national list (called SU). Some of these patients need mechanical circulatory support with ECMO. In order to compare two groups of patients on SU, who acceeded to heart transplantation (HT) with or without ECMO, we reviewed retrospectively 20 consecutive patients transplanted on SU between January 2004 and September 2007 in Rennes. Among them, 10 were transplanted without ECMO and 10 others were implanted with a femoro-femoral ECMO before HT. (1) Considering the group SU without pretransplantation ECMO: 2 years survival rate was 70%. Mean hospital stay was 26.4 days. Three patients were implanted with ECMO for graft dysfunction during postoperative course, without inherent complication. None graft dysfunction occurred after initial hospitalization; (2) considering the group SU with pretransplantation ECMO: 2 years survival rate was 90% (one early death). Mean hospital stay was 45 days with multiple complications due to the ECMO (leg's ischemia: n = 2; lung oedema: n = 1; lymphorrhea: n = 3, low flow requiring change of canulae: n = 1). None graft dysfunction occurred after initial hospitalization. Although we didn't reach statistical significance, it seems that ECMO for patients in SU may be useful as bridge to transplant but with a higher morbidity than for similar patients transplanted without ECMO. Additional data from other transplant centers are needed to confirm our findings.
