Unusual cardiac tamponade: Giant primary cardiac myxoid liposarcoma. Primary cardiac myxoid liposarcoma is an extremely rare disease. We reported a 61-year-old man with a 1-month history of aggressive dyspnea and anorexia due to a giant primary cardiac myxoid liposarcoma.

Heart transplantation may be an alternative therapy for such isolated and unresectable tumor. 'cardiac myxoid liposarcoma', 'cardiac tamponade', 'heart transplantation'
