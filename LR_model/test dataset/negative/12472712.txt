Acute rhabdomyolysis after cardiac transplantation: a diagnostic conundrum. A 13-year-old girl presented with right ventricular failure secondary to Ebstein's malformation (downward displacement of the tricuspid valve leaflets with adherence to the right ventricular muscle and redundancy or dysplasia of the tricuspid valve leaflets). She subsequently required a heart transplant but developed rhabdomyolysis early in the postoperative period and required ventilatory support for more than 3 weeks. A variety of causes were considered, but her condition improved only when cyclosporin was eliminated from the immunosuppression regimen. We believe it is likely that the rhabdomyolysis has been caused by cyclosporin. If so, this has occurred both earlier in the clinical course and at lower serum concentrations than previously described.
