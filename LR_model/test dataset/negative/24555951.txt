A case of parvovirus B19-induced pure red cell aplasia in a child following heart transplant. We describe a case of an 11-year-old boy who underwent orthotopic heart transplant for dilated cardiomyopathy. He developed a normocytic, normochromic anaemia with a low reticulocyte count 1 month after transplant. A bone marrow biopsy was performed, which showed a mildly hypocellular bone marrow with few red blood cell precursors with giant pro-erythroblasts indicative of a pure red cell aplasia. Parvovirus B19 polymerase chain reaction in the blood was positive 2 months after transplant. Intravenous immunoglobulin administration resulted in a resolution of the anaemia over several months. Unexplained pure red cell aplasia in immunosuppressed patients should alert one to the possibility of parvovirus B19 infection.  'red cell aplasia'
