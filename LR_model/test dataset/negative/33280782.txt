Diagnosis and Image-guided Therapy of Cardiac Left Ventricular Assist Device Infections. Due to limited availability of donor hearts, more and more end stage heart failure patients are dependent on left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as their destination therapy rather than the original intended use as a bridge for heart transplantation. While LVADs improve life expectancy in these patients, infection emerges as one of the major adverse events. Early and accurate localization of LVAD infection is critical, as it can significantly influence clinical management decisions and ultimately impact patient outcome. Although the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation has defined 3 categories for LVAD infection: (1) LVAD-specific infection, (2) LVAD-related infection, and (3) non-LVAD infection, there is still lack of standardized criteria for diagnosing these 3 types of LVAD infections. Morphologically based imaging tools such as transesophageal echocardiogram and cardiac computed tomography (CT) or CT angiogram have limited roles in diagnosing LVAD infections due to their nonspecific findings, often affected by significant streaking and beam hardening artifacts from the metal device. In contrast,
