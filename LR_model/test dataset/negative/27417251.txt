Treatment of advanced group 2 PH. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) frequently occurs in patients with left heart disease (LHD), including heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction and valvular heart disease. PH in patients with LHD is associated with worse outcomes making it an attractive target of therapy. Despite the strong rational for treatment, no clear benefits from treating with pulmonary arterial hypertension specific therapies in patients with PH from LHD have been found in clinical trials and some studies have demonstrated harm. Therefore, PH in the setting of LHD should be managed with optimal medical and surgical treatment of LHD and identification and treatment of comorbidities that could contribute to PH. Additionally, significant PH is a contraindication to heart transplantation and, in select patients with left heart failure, left ventricular unloading with prolonged inotrope infusion or left ventricular assist device implantation may successfully reduce pulmonary artery pressures and facilitate transplantation.
