Left atrial plication for heart transplantation in patients with giant left atrium. Giant left atrium occasionally occurs in patients undergoing heart transplantation and causes a technical challenge for the surgeon because of the substantial discrepancy in size between the left atrial cuffs of the recipient and donor. We describe a left atrial plication technique that substantially reduces this discrepancy and allows for a standard left atrial anastomosis to be performed without any other modifications in technique.
