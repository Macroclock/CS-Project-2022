Breakthrough in the Transplantation of Thoracic Organs in Hungary. In 2016 the focus was, by all means, on the transplantation on thoracic organs. More than 50 heart transplantations were performed in this year. With this achievement, the Hungarian Heart Transplantation Program became one of the leading programs in the world. In the Thoracic Surgery Unit of the National Institute of Oncology and the Thoracic Surgery Department of Semmelweis University the first successful lung transplantation was carried out on December 12, 2015 when the Hungarian Lung Transplantation Program was launched.
