Pathological antibody-mediated rejection in pediatric heart transplant recipients: Immunologic risk factors, hemodynamic significance, and outcomes. Biopsy-diagnosed pAMR has been observed in over half of pediatric HT recipients within 6 years of transplantation. We report the incidence and outcomes of pAMR at our center. All endomyocardial biopsies for all HT recipients transplanted between 2010 and 2015 were reviewed and classified using contemporary ISHLT guidelines. Graft dysfunction was defined as a qualitative decrement in systolic function by echocardiogram or an increase of ≥3 mm Hg in atrial filling pressure by direct measurement. Among 96 patients, pAMR2 occurred in 7 (7%) over a median follow-up period of 3.1 years, while no cases of pAMR3 occurred. A history of CHD, DSA at transplant, and elevated filling pressures were associated with pAMR2. Five-sixths (83%) of patients developed new C1q+ DSA at the time of pAMR diagnosis. There was a trend toward reduced survival, with 43% of patients dying within 2.3 years of pAMR diagnosis. 'antibody', 'heart', 'hemodynamics', 'outcomes', 'rejection'
