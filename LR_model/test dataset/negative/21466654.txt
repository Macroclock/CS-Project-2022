LFA-1 antagonism inhibits early infiltration of endogenous memory CD8 T cells into cardiac allografts and donor-reactive T cell priming. Alloreactive memory T cells are present in virtually all transplant recipients due to prior sensitization or heterologous immunity and mediate injury undermining graft outcome. In mouse models, endogenous memory CD8 T cells infiltrate MHC-mismatched cardiac allografts and produce IFN-γ in response to donor class I MHC within 24 h posttransplant. The current studies analyzed the efficacy of anti-LFA-1 mAb to inhibit early CD8 T cell cardiac allograft infiltration and activation. Anti-LFA-1 mAb given to C57BL/6 6 (H-2(b)) recipients of A/J (H-2(a)) heart grafts on days -1 and 0 completely inhibited CD8 T cell allograft infiltration, markedly decreased neutrophil infiltration and significantly reduced intragraft expression levels of IFN-γ-induced genes. Donor-specific T cells producing IFN-γ were at low/undetectable numbers in spleens of anti-LFA-1 mAb treated recipients until day 21. These effects combined to promote substantial prolongation (from day 8 to 27) in allograft survival. Delaying anti-LFA-1 mAb treatment until days 3 and 4 posttransplant did not inhibit early memory CD8 T cell infiltration and proliferation within the allograft. These data indicate that peritransplant anti-LFA-1 mAb inhibits early donor-reactive memory CD8 T cell allograft infiltration and inflammation suggesting an effective strategy to attenuate the negative effects of heterologous immunity in transplant recipients.
