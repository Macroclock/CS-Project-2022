Waitlist and Post-Heart Transplant Outcomes for Children With Nondilated Cardiomyopathy. Although outcomes for pediatric cardiomyopathy (CMP) patients have improved, an understanding of outcomes by CMP phenotype is essential. This study assessed changes in waitlist and post-transplant survival in nondilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients over 2 decades, explored ventricular assist device (VAD) utilization in this cohort, and identified risk factors for waitlist and posttransplant mortality in the current era. Pediatric patients with a diagnosis of CMP listed for heart transplantation during three eras: Era 1: March 5, 1999 to December 31, 2004; Era 2: January 1, 2005 to December 15, 2011; and Era 3 (current era): December 16, 2011 to February 28, 2018 were included. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to assess waitlist and posttransplant survival. Compared with patients with DCM, those with hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathy in the current era are less likely to be on VAD (23.4% vs 2.7% vs 4.5%); listed United Network for Organ Sharing Status 1A (75.6% vs 39.8% vs 34.8%), and more likely to have longer waitlist times (P < .01 for all). Only 3.3% hypertrophic and 2.4% restrictive cardiomyopathy patients had VAD implantation, although VAD use did not adversely impact waitlist survival in weighted non-DCM patients. Significant improvements have occurred in waitlist survival of hypertrophic and posttransplant survival of both types of non-DCM patients. Currently, waitlist and posttransplant survival is similar for all CMP phenotypes. VAD use is low in patients with non-DCM, although this did not increase waitlist mortality in adjusted analysis. Further studies in patients with non-DCM are needed to determine optimal timing and anatomic characteristics most likely to benefit from VAD implantation during the waitlist period.
