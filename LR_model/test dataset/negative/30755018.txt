Isocapnic buffering period: From physiology to clinics. During cardiopulmonary exercise test, the isocapnic buffering period ranges between anaerobic threshold (AT) and respiratory compensation point (RCP). We investigated whether oxygen uptake (VO We retrospectively analysed reduced ejection fraction heart failure patients who attained RCP at cardiopulmonary exercise test. The study endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular mortality and urgent heart transplantation/left ventricular assist device implantation. Hazard ratio was assessed to identify the increase of risk associated with ΔVO AT and RCP were both identified in 782 (39.2%) out of 1995 reduced ejection fraction heart failure cases.
