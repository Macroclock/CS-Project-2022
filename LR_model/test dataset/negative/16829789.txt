Angiogenic growth factors in cardiac allograft rejection. Normal adult vasculature is in a quiescent state. In transplanted hearts, peri- and postoperative ischemic and alloimmune stimuli may be interpreted as inadequate tissue perfusion leading to activation of angiogenic signaling. Although this may have protective functions, improper activation of cardiac allograft endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells may actually result in impaired survival of cardiac allografts. In this paper, we review the current knowledge on angiogenic growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietins, and platelet-derived growth factor in cardiac allografts. We also discuss the potential for therapies aimed at angiogenic growth factors in preventing and treating cardiac allograft rejection and transplant coronary artery disease.
