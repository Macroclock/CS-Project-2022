Single-cell transcriptomic identified HIF1A as a target for attenuating acute rejection after heart transplantation. Acute rejection (AR) is an important contributor to graft failure, which remains a leading cause of death after heart transplantation (HTX). The regulation of immune metabolism has become a new hotspot in the development of immunosuppressive drugs. In this study, Increased glucose metabolism of cardiac macrophages was found in patients with AR. To find new therapeutic targets of immune metabolism regulation for AR, CD45 'Acute rejection', 'HIF1A', 'Heart transplantation', 'Immune metabolism'
