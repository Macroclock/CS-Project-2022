Incidence, etiology, and outcome of primary graft dysfunction in adult heart transplant recipients: a single-center experience in Japan. Donor and recipient characteristics, as well as donor-recipient matching, affect clinical outcomes after heart transplantation (HTx). This study aimed to clarify how donor and recipient characteristics affect the clinical course after HTx. The medical records of all the patients who underwent HTx at the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center from 1999 to 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Sixty-one patients (48 males) underwent HTx. Six recipients (9.8 %) developed primary graft dysfunction (PGD) determined by criteria recently established at a consensus conference. Development of PGD was associated with high-dose inotropic support for the donor heart and a history of stroke in the recipient (p = 0.04 and p = 0.002, respectively). Recipients with PGD had higher right atrial pressure (RAP) and lower cardiac output (CO) compared with those without PGD at 6 months after HTx (RAP, 6.8 ± 3.6 vs. 2.8 ± 2.2 mmHg, p < 0.001; CO, 4.6 ± 0.8 l vs. 5.8 ± 1.2 l/min, p = 0.02). With respect to survival, patients with PGD had a 5-year survival rate equivalent to those without PGD (83.3 vs. 93.3 %, p = 0.23). High-dose inotropic support for the donor heart and a history of stroke in the recipient are significant predictive factors for the development of PGD. However, recipients with PGD demonstrate mid-term survival comparable to those without PGD. 'Heart transplantation', 'Marginal donor', 'Primary graft dysfunction'
