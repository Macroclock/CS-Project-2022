Fatal disseminated toxoplasmosis in a cardiac transplantation with seropositive match for Toxoplasma: should prophylaxis be extended? In cardiac transplant, toxoplasmosis in the immunocompromised recipient can result either from the transmission of the parasite from a seropositive donor (D+) to a seronegative recipient (R-) with the transplanted organ (more common) or from the reactivation of a pre-transplant latent infection (D-/R+ or D+/R+). In the immunocompromised patient, toxoplasmosis is a life-threatening disease. We report a case of disseminated toxoplasmosis following heart transplantation in a Toxoplasma seropositive recipient before transplantation (R+) (IgG 1:160, IgM negative) who received an organ from a Toxoplasma seropositive donor (D+) (IgG 1:640, IgM negative). No anti-Toxoplasma prophylactic treatment was administered. A number of complications arose in the postoperative period, as well as Enterobacter cloacae and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) (reactivation) infections, but neither serological nor histological toxoplasma recrudescence was evidenced. The patient died on post transplant day 41. Post-autopsy histological examinations revealed an unexpected diffuse toxoplasmosis (lungs, brain, heart).
