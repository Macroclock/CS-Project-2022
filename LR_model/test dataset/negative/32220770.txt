Prognostic factors for heart recovery in adult patients with acute fulminant myocarditis and cardiogenic shock supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an effective support method for acute fulminant myocarditis (AFM) with cardiogenic shock. However, deciding whether to bridge to a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or to maintain ECMO support until heart recovery is still controversial. This was a retrospective observational study from a single center. Eighty-eight adults with AFM and ECMO support between 2006 and 2018 were included. The primary endpoint was heart recovery without heart transplantation or long-term LVAD support. The heart recovery group contained 43 patients, of whom 41 were discharged after being weaned off ECMO and the other two after LVAD. Five patients with heart transplants and one with long-term LVAD support were discharged, accounting for an overall survival of 55.7%. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that peak CK-MB level, severe intraventricular conduction disturbance (asystole) and malignant arrhythmia (VT or VF) were prognostic factors for nonrecovery (P = .027 and 0.017, respectively), while early intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) use before ECMO was highly likely to have a protective effect with a trend toward statistical significance (P = .079). A risk score was developed: 4 points for VT/VF/asystole, 1 point for every 100 μg/L increase in the peak CK-MB level, up to a maximum of 5 points, and -3 points for early IVIG use. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.818. High CK-MB levels and VT/VF/asystole in patients with AFM are associated with poor heart recovery. Early IVIG use shows a potentially protective effect. 'Acute myocarditis', 'Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation', 'Fulminant myocarditis', 'Intravenous immunoglobulin'
