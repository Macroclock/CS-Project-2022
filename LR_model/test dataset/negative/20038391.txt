[Pharmacogenetic analysis of the absorption kinetics of cyclosporine in a population of Spanish cardiac transplant patients]. To determine how single nucleotide polymorphisms located on genes MDR1, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 affect the absorption kinetics of cyclosporine in cardiac transplant patients. We selected a sample of 30 adult patients having previously undergone a primary cardiac transplant and who had received cyclosporine as an immunosuppressant. During the first month after the transplant, we performed a pharmacokinetic study of each patient to determine values in the cyclosporine concentration area under the 12-hour curve, steady-state cyclosporine concentration, maximum cyclosporine concentration, and time to reach that concentration. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in all patients: MDR1 3435C > T, CYP3A4-390A > G and CYP3A5 6986A > G. Being a carrier of the T-allele for polymorphism MDR1 3435C > T is associated with higher values in the cyclosporine concentration area under the 12-hour curve (p = 0.01) and in steady-state cyclosporine concentration (p = 0.05), compared with those from patients who do not carry that allele. Our results show that genotype differences in MDR1 3435C > T can explain part of the variability in cyclosporine absorption among individuals in the population of Spanish cardiac transplant recipients.
