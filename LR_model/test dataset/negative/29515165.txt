Rap1 deficiency-provoked paracrine dysfunction impairs immunosuppressive potency of mesenchymal stem cells in allograft rejection of heart transplantation. Immunomodulatory activity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is largely mediated by paracrine factors. Our previous studies showed that activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) regulates cytokine/growth factor secretion by MSCs. This study aimed to elucidate the role of Rap1 (repressor/activator protein), a novel modulator involved in the NF-κB pathway, in regulating the immunomodulatory potency of MSCs in acute allograft rejection of heart transplantation. The immunosuppressive potency of wild-type MSCs (WT-MSCs) or Rap1-deficient MSCs (Rap1
