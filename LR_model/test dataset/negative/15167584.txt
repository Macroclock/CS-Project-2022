Rapamycin protects allografts from rejection while simultaneously attacking tumors in immunosuppressed mice. Cancer is an increasingly recognized problem associated with immunosuppression. Recent reports, however, suggest that the immunosuppressive agent rapamycin has anti-cancer properties that could address this problem. Thus far, rapamycin's effects on immunity and cancer have been studied separately. Here we tested the effects of rapamycin, versus cyclosporine A (CsA), on established tumors in mice simultaneously bearing a heart allograft. In one tumor-transplant model, BALB/c mice received subcutaneous syngenic CT26 colon adenocarcinoma cells 7 days before C3H ear-heart transplantation. Rapamycin or CsA treatment was initiated with transplantation. In a second model system, a B16 melanoma was established in C57BL/6 mice that received a primary vascularized C3H heart allograft. In vitro angiogenic effects of rapamycin and CsA were tested in an aortic ring assay. Results show that CT26 tumors grew for 2 weeks before tumor complications occurred. However, rapamycin protected allografts, inhibited tumor growth, and permitted animal survival. In contrast, CsA-treated mice succumbed to advancing tumors, albeit with a functioning allograft. Rapamycin's antitumor effect also functioned in severe combined immunodeficient BALB/c mice. Similar effects of the drugs occurred with B16 melanomas and primary vascularized C3H allografts in C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, in this model, rapamycin inhibited the tumor growth-enhancing effects of CsA. Moreover, in vitro experiments showed that CsA promotes angiogenesis by a transforming growth factor-beta-related mechanism, and that this effect is abrogated by rapamycin. This study demonstrates that rapamycin simultaneously protects allografts from rejection and attacks tumors in a complex transplant-tumor situation. Notably, CsA protects allografts from rejection, but cancer progression is promoted in transplant recipients.
