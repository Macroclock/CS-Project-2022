[Severe anterior myocardial infarction caused by amphetamine abuse]. We present a case showing that intake of amphetamine can cause severe anterior myocardial infarction with acute severe pump failure. Acute angiography revealed massive proximal thrombotic occlusion of the LAD, the first diagonal branch and septal branches in a 28-year-old man. Thrombectomy, balloon dilation and stenting were performed. Spasm thrombus interplay was found to be the likely mechanism. Due to the massive infarction, extremely depressed left ventricular performance and hemodynamic instability, the patient underwent successful heart transplantation. The patient was readmitted to hospital six months later due to chronic vascular rejection of the heart, which lead to the death of the young man.
