Heart transplantation in infants with idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Whereas it is well known that idiopathic HCM can present in newborns and infants, little information is available on HT in this very young age group. We report a series of 17 infants with idiopathic HCM, including two neonates with rapidly progressive severe HF for whom HT was necessary. When HF manifests in a newborn/infant with idiopathic HCM and extreme cavity size reduction, the possibility of a rapidly progressive clinical course should be anticipated and HT may become the only available therapeutic solution.
