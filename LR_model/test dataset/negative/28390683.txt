Prognostic Utility of Right Ventricular Free Wall Strain in Low Risk Patients After Orthotopic Heart Transplantation. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) by speckle-tracking echocardiography is a sensitive measure of regional left and right ventricular (LV and RV) dysfunction, before onset of overt systolic dysfunction. We sought to evaluate the prognostic utility of measuring LV-GLS and RV free wall strain (FWS) in low risk patients at 1 year after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). We retrospectively studied 96 OHT recipients (age 52 ± 14 years, 64% men) free of antibody-mediated rejection or moderate to severe coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV, grade 2 to 3) at 1 year after transplant. LV-GLS and RV-FWS were calculated using EchoPAC software. Cox models were developed after adjusting for the Index for Mortality Prediction After Cardiac Transplantation (IMPACT) score (post-transplant risk score), with the primary outcome of death, moderate to severe CAV, or treated rejection. At 1 year after transplant, LV ejection fraction and RV fractional area change (FAC) were 58 ± 7% and 42 ± 10%, respectively. LV-GLS was -17.0 ± 3.3% and RV-FWS -16.4 ± 4.5%. At an average follow-up of 4.5 years, 28 patients met the primary end point (10 death, 5 vasculopathy, 17 rejection). In sequential Cox models, markers of RV function were associated with the primary outcome (RV-FAC, p = 0.012; RV-FWS, p = 0.022), while LV ejection fraction and LV-GLS were not. We conclude that in low risk patients 1 year after OHT, markers of RV function (RV-FAC and RV-FWS) are independently associated with incident rejection, CAV, and death. Markers of RV dysfunction could potentially be incorporated into risk scores and future prospective studies to risk stratify patients after OHT.
