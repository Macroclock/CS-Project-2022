Support program for heart transplant patients: initial experience. Trials of education and support in heart failure patients have shown an improvement in patient prognosis with favorable results in cost-benefit analysis. To assess the impact of a telephone support program for heart transplant patients during the first year after transplantation. We analyzed 30 consecutive heart transplant patients at our institution, who were randomized to either a standard care group or a group with the additional possibility of direct telephone contact with a cardiologist. We analyzed the time employed answering the calls, the reasons for consultation, and the number of hospital trips avoided. Among the total sample, 15 patients were assigned to the intervention program. Over 194 +/- 103 days, we received 28 calls. The mean call duration was 10.2 +/- 3.9 minutes, with 39.3% of the consultations concerning medication dosages 28.6% lifestyle issues, 25% infectious symptoms, and the remaining 7%, medication side effects. Medication readjustments were made in 33% of the calls; 10.7% of the calls, all for infectious symptoms, required direct medical consultation. Telephone support may be useful to improve therapeutic compliance, adjust the medications, and avoid treatment errors, as well as detect early complications during follow-up. In addition, it may avoid unnecessary medical visits.
