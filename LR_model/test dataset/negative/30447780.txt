Perioperative Management of the Cardiac Transplant Recipient. Management of the cardiac transplant recipient includes careful titration of inotropes and vasopressors. Recipient pulmonary hypertension and ventilatory status must be optimized to prevent allograft right ventricular failure. Vasoplegia, coagulopathy, arrhythmias, and renal dysfunction also require careful management to achieve an optimal outcome. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) can be an ominous problem after cardiac transplantation. Although mild degrees of PGD may be managed medically, mechanical circulatory support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or temporary ventricular assist devices may be required. Retransplantation may be necessary in some cases.
