[Exploring the experience of living with a heart transplant: a systematic review of the literature]. The focus of healthcare professionals is shifting from illness to health and the individual experience of each person. However, current health care continues to focus on the prevention and treatment of medical complications, leaving aside other important aspects of the experience of cardiac transplant patients. The aim of this systematic review of the literature was to explore how living with a transplanted heart affects their lives. We searched the databases Pubmed, Cinahl, Scielo, Scopus, Dialnet, Cuiden and PsyINFO, and specialized journals. Twenty-five articles were included for study. The analysis and interpretation of the results was based on the methodology by Dixon-Woods et al and by Evans. The results were grouped into seven categories: spiritual repercussions, psychological repercussions, social repercussions, relationship with the donor and the organ, repercussions in the physical environment and quality of life, coping strategies, and feelings towards the healthcare professionals. The results confirm the need for a change in the care given to cardiac transplant patients given that, although transplantation has been shown to improve the quality and quantity of life, it has multiple psychosocial implications that affect the well-being and day-to-day life of these patients.
