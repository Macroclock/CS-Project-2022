Gene transfer of programmed death ligand-1.Ig prolongs cardiac allograft survival. The CD28 homologue programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2 (which are homologous to B7), constitute an inhibitory pathway of T cell costimulation. The PD-1 pathway is of interest for immune-mediated diseases given that PD-1-deficient mice develop autoimmune diseases. We have evaluated the effect of local overexpression of a PD-L1.Ig fusion protein on cardiac allograft survival. Adenovirus-mediated PD-L1.Ig gene transfer was performed in F344 rat donor hearts placed in the abdominal position in Lewis recipients. Inflammatory cell infiltrates in the grafts were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Allografts transduced with the PD-L1.Ig gene survived for longer periods of time compared with those receiving noncoding adenovirus or virus dilution buffer alone: median survival time (MST), 17 (range: 16-20) days vs. 11 (8-14) and 9 (8-13) days, respectively (P < 0.001). PD-L1.Ig gene transfer combined with a subtherapeutic regimen of cyclosporin A (CsA) was superior to CsA alone: MST, 25 (15-42) vs. 15 (13-19) days (P < 0.05). PD-L1.Ig gene transfer was associated with decreased numbers of CD4 cells and monocytes/macrophages infiltrating the graft (P < 0.05). Localized PD-L1.Ig expression in donor hearts attenuates acute allograft rejection in a rat model. The effect is additive to that of a subtherapeutic regimen of CsA. These results suggest that targeting of PD-1 by gene therapy may inhibit acute cardiac allograft rejection in vivo.
