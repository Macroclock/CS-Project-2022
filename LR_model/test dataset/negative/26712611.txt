Successful Bridge to Orthotopic Cardiac Transplantation with Implantation of a HeartWare HVAD in Management of Systemic Right Ventricular Failure in a Patient with Transposition of the Great Arteries and Previous Atrial Switch Procedure. A clinical case is described of a patient with a history of dextro-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA) and prior atrial switch procedure who developed significant pulmonary hypertension whilst awaiting orthotopic cardiac transplantation. The increase in his pulmonary pressures necessitated de-listing for cardiac transplantation. A strategy of ventricular assist device (VAD) placement was then employed which provided improvement in his systemic cardiac output with left atrial off-loading to provide pulmonary vascular remodelling and consequently reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). He was supported for a period of 408 days prior to successful orthotopic cardiac transplantation. A small number of cases with this abnormality undergoing VAD implantation have been described. Mechanical circulatory support has an important role in some patients with congenital heart disease.  'Pulmonary hypertension', 'Ventricular assist device', 'd-Transposition'
