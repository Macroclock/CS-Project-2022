Chagas disease in solid organ and heart transplantation. The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic infections with the microorganism Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease, is important in solid organ transplantation in both endemic and nonendemic countries. In this review, we examine recently published data on the topic of Chagas disease in solid organ transplantation, with an emphasis on data relevant to heart transplantation. Most people with chronic T. cruzi infection have the intermediate form of disease, but approximately 2% of infected persons will progress to Chagas cardiomyopathy per year. The risk of T. cruzi transmission with liver or kidney transplantation appears to be substantially less than that with heart transplantation. For patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy undergoing heart transplant, a structured clinical and laboratory monitoring protocol is necessary to monitor for T. cruzi reactivation. Recent data indicate that laboratory monitoring of peripheral blood with polymerase chain reaction testing can identify reactivation prior to the occurrence of symptoms and allograft injury. Transplant clinicians should exercise vigilance in surveillance for Chagas disease in both organ donors and recipients. Although Chagas disease may seem uncommon, it is pervasive in endemic and several nonendemic countries, including the United States and Spain.
