Ceftolozane/tazobactam for the treatment of MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa left ventricular assist device infection as a bridge to heart transplant. Ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) is a novel antibiotic with enhanced microbiological activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative bacteria, including MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Five months after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation, a 49-year old man developed fever and blood culture was positive for MDR P. aeruginosa, susceptible only to aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and colistin. A diagnosis of LVAD-related infection was made based on persistent bacteremia associated with moderate 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT uptake in the left ventricular apex. Disk diffusion testing for C/T was performed (MIC 2 Î¼g/mL) and intravenous antibiotic therapy with C/T and amikacin was started, with clinical and microbiological response. Initial conservative management with 6 weeks of systemic antibiotic therapy was attempted, but the patient relapsed one month after antibiotic discontinuation. Priority for transplantation was given and after 4 weeks of antibiotic therapy (C/T + amikacin), LVAD removal and heart transplant were performed, with no infection relapse. We reported the first off-label use of C/T in the management of MDR P. aeruginosa LVAD infection as a bridge to heart transplant. C/T has shown potent anti-pseudomonal activity and good safety profile making this drug as a good candidate for suppressive strategy in intravascular device-associated bloodstream infections caused by MDR P. aeruginosa.
