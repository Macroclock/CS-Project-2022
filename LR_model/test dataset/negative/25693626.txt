Identification and management of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome immediately post-heart transplantation. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a serious hematologic disorder with high mortality if left untreated. A comprehensive literature review revealed only two cases of aHUS post-heart transplantation. In both cases the disease developed after induction of calcineurin inhibitor therapy. We report a case of immediate post-heart transplantation aHUS, manifested before the induction of, and therefore not associated with, calcineurin inhibitors.
