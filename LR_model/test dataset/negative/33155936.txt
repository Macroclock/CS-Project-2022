[Features of the clinical picture and outcomes in patients from a heart transplantation waiting list with different causes of heart failure]. Aim To identify clinical differences between patients on the heart transplant waiting list (HTWL) in the origin of chronic heart failure (CHF).Materials and methods From January 2010 through September 2019, 235 patients (age, 47+13 years (from 10 to 67 years); men, 79% (n=186)) were included in the HTWL. The patients were divided into two groups; group 1 (n=104, 44 %) consisted of patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD); group 2 (n=131, 56 %) included patients with noncoronarogenic CHF. Clinical and instrumental data and frequency of the mechanical circulatory support (MCS) as a "bridge" to heart transplantation (HT) were retrospectively evaluated.Results Group 1 included more male patients than group 2 [97 % (n=101) and 82 % (n=85), р&lt;0.0001]; patients were older (54±8 and 42±14 years, р=0.0001). On inclusion into the HTWL, the CHF functional class was comparable in the groups, III [III;IV]; there were more patients of the UNOS 2 class in group 1 than in group 2 [75 % (n=78) and 57 % (n=75), р=0.005]. Patient distribution in UNOS 1B and 1A classes was comparable in the groups: 21% (n=22) and 3% (n=4) in group 1 and 33 % (n=43) and 10 % (n=13) in group 2. According to echocardiography patients of group 1 compared to group 2 showed a tendency towards higher values of left ventricular ejection fraction (Simpson method) [22 [18;26] % and 19 [15;24] %, р=0.37] and stroke volume [59 [44;72] % and 50 [36;67] %, р=0.07]. Numbers of patients with a cardioverter defibrillator or a cardiac resynchronization device with a defibrillator function were comparable in the groups [35 % (n=36) and 34 % (n=45)]. Comparison of comorbidities in groups 1 and 2 showed higher incidences of pulmonary hypertension [55 % (n=57) and 36 % (n=47), р=0.005], obesity [20 % (n=21) and 10 % (n=13), р=0.03], and type 2 diabetes mellitus [29 % (n=30) and 10 % (n=13), р=0.0004]. Rates of chronic obstructive lung disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease and other diseases were comparable. Duration of staying on the HTWL was comparable (104 [34; 179] and 108 [37; 229] days). During staying on the HTWL, patients of group 1 less frequently required MCS implantation [3 % (n=3) and 28 % (n=21), р=0.0009]. HT was performed for 59 % patients (n=61) in group 2 and 52 % (n=69) patients in group 2. Death rate in the HTWL was lower in group 1 [13 % (n=14) and 27 % (n=35), р&lt;0.01].Conclusion On inclusion into the HTWL, patients with noncoronarogenic CHF had more pronounced CHF manifestations and a more severe UNOS class but fewer comorbidities than patients with CHF of ischemic origin. With a comparable duration of waiting for HT, patients with noncoronarogenic CHD more frequently required MCS implantation and had a higher death rate.
