Role of regulatory T cells in CD47/donor-specific transfusion-induced immune tolerance in skin-heart transplantation mice. To explore the role of regulatory T (T C57BL/6 mice received DST of splenocytes from CD47 We observed that mean survival time (MST) of skin or heart graft was significantly longer in C57BL/6 mice which received DST from CD47 Our results indicated that CD47 expression on DST cells plays an important role in the induction of immune tolerance in mice with skin-heart transplantation. Increased percentage of T 'DST', 'Treg cells', 'co-transplantation of skin and heart', 'immune tolerance'
