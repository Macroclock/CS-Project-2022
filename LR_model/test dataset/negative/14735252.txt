B-type natriuretic peptide levels in congenital heart disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential role of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in children with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac catheterization. Measurement of plasma BNP concentration has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of adult patients with congestive heart failure, but little is known about the role of BNP in children with structural congenital heart disease. We measured plasma BNP levels using the Triage BNP test in patients with congenital heart disease referred for diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterization. Plasma BNP concentration was measured in 96 children and 11 adults > or = 19 years old (7.9+/-8.3 years) undergoing heart catheterization for underlying congenital heart disease. BNP levels ranged from < 5 to > 1300 pg/ml, with a median BNP concentration of 19.0 pg/ml. Baseline BNP concentrations were > 100.0 pg/ml on 19 occasions in 17 patients. The pressure difference between the left ventricle and ascending aorta was 10-110 mmHg in 21 patients. BNP concentrations for this cohort ranged from < 5.0 to 1060.0 pg/ml and correlated with the degree of left ventricular outflow obstruction (correlation coefficient, 0.661; p = 0.001). This study suggests that with additional research, BNP concentration may prove to be a useful clinical tool in managing children and adults with congenital heart disease.
