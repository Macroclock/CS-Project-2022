Changes in heart transplant waitlist and posttransplant outcomes in patients with restrictive and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with the new heart transplant allocation system. Historically, patients with restrictive (RCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) experienced longer wait-times for heart transplant (HT) and increased waitlist mortality. Recently, a new HT allocation system was implemented in the United States. We sought to determine the impact of the new HT system on RCM/HCM patients. Adult patients with RCM/HCM listed for HT between November 2015 and September 2019 were identified from the UNOS database. Patients were stratified into two groups: old system and new system. We identified 872 patients who met inclusion criteria. Of these, 608 and 264 were classified in the old and new system groups, respectively. The time in the waitlist was shorter (25 vs. 54 days, P < .001), with an increased frequency of HT in the new system (74% vs. 68%, P = .024). Patients who were transplanted in the new system had a longer ischemic time, increased use of temporary mechanical circulatory support and mechanical ventilation. There was no difference in posttransplant survival at 9 months (91.1% vs. 88.9%) (p = .4). We conclude that patients with RCM/HCM have benefited from the new HT allocation system, with increased access to HT without affecting short-term posttransplant survival.
