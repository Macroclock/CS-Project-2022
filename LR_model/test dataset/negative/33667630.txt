Huge right ventricular outflow tract aneurysm late following total repair of tetralogy of Fallot leading to orthotopic heart transplantation. Described herein are 3 patients who underwent successful orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) because of huge, calcified right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) aneurysms after repair of tetralogy of Fallot 35, 43, and 59 years earlier. Two of the 3 patients developed recurring episodes of ventricular tachycardia simulating arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. 'Tetralogy of Fallot, ventricular tachycardia', 'bundle branch block', 'right-sided heart failure'
