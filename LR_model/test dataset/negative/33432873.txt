Long term outcome of heart failure patients disqualified from heart transplantation. The prognosis of patients with advanced heart failure is unfavourable. However, little is known about the survival of patients referred for heart transplantation but finally disqualified from transplantation due to contraindications. This study aimed to evaluate the prognosis of patients' disqualified from heart transplantation. It was a retrospective study based on medical records of patients disqualified from heart transplantation. One hundred and fifty-one patients were included and 94 deaths were recorded during long-term follow-up (range 0.02-10.1 years). The survival rate at 5 years was 25%. The mean age of the studied population was 57.7 years and the majority of patients were males, 87.4%. The ischaemic aetiology (66.2%) was the most dominant aetiology of heart failure. In the Cox regression model, supervision by the specialist cardiology centre (HR 0.61; The prognosis of patients disqualified from heart transplantation is unfavourable. However, some of the patients experience relatively long survival. Therefore, careful clinical assessment and identification of factors influencing prognosis may improve adequate patients' qualifications for heart transplantation.
