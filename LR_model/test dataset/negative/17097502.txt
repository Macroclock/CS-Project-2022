Detection of coronary artery disease in orthotopic heart transplant recipients with 64-detector row computed tomography angiography. Cardiac transplant recipients develop coronary artery disease in the form of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), and still undergo annual left heart catheterizations for detection at most centers. We prospectively enrolled 20 cardiac transplant recipients scheduled for annual left heart catheterization with X-ray coronary angiography (XRA) to also undergo electrocardiographically gated coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA), which was performed on a 64-detector computed tomography scanner. CTA detected more CAV vs XRA in 4 patients and less CAV in 0 patient, resulting in good overall agreement between the two modalities (kappa = 0.69). CTA may be superior to conventional catheter-based angiography to identify non-obstructive vessel wall disease that may go unrecognized with catheter-based angiography alone.
