Transcriptional Profiling of Normal, Stenotic, and Regurgitant Human Aortic Valves. The genetic mechanisms underlying aortic stenosis (AS) and aortic insufficiency (AI) disease progression remain unclear. We hypothesized that normal aortic valves and those with AS or AI all exhibit unique transcriptional profiles. Normal control (NC) aortic valves were collected from non-matched donor hearts that were otherwise acceptable for transplantation ( 'RNA sequencing', 'aortic insufficiency', 'aortic stenosis', 'transcriptional profiling'
