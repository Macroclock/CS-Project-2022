Surgical considerations for cardiac allograft rejection. This article reviews the surgical considerations of cardiac allograft rejection after heart transplantation and describes current treatment modalities for the failing graft. Cardiac allograft rejection can be a moribund diagnosis, especially when it is acute and high grade. It is broadly categorized into hyperacute, acute cellular, and antibody-mediated rejection. Treatment includes a multitude of medical and immunomodulation therapies for graft recovery. Severe rejection requires mechanical circulatory support for hemodynamic stability to maintain end-organ function. Retransplantation for graft loss is the ultimate therapy; however, it portends poor outcomes.
