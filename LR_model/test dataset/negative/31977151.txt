Salvage heart transplantation for Mycoplasma hominis prosthetic valve endocarditis: A case report and review of the literature. Heart transplantation (HT) has been rarely performed in patients with infective endocarditis (IE) and is considered a "last resort" procedure. Orthotropic HT with bicaval technique was performed in a man with culture-negative endocarditis. Mycoplasma hominis was later detected using 16S ribosomal DNA PCR from surgically removed valve tissue. Literature review and previous results are summarized. HT may be considered as salvage treatment in selected patients with intractable IE. In cases when there is no growth in culture, 16S ribosomal DNA PCR sequencing can be used to identify the pathogen in excised valvular tissue. Mycoplasma spp. is extremely uncommon and difficult to diagnose cause of infective endocarditis (IE). There are no proposed or defined criteria for heart transplantation (HT) in patients with refractory IE, and HT has been rarely performed in this setting. We report a case of MÂ hominis prosthetic valve endocarditis diagnosed by 16S ribosomal DNA PCR in a patient who underwent a salvage HT. We reviewed in the literature other cases of IE caused by Mycoplasma spp. '\nMycoplasma\n', 'infective endocarditis', 'salvage heart transplantation'
