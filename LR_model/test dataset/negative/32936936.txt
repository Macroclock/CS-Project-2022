Outcomes of heart transplantation in patients bridged with Impella 5.0: Comparison with native chest transplanted patients without preoperative mechanical circulatory support. The Impella (Abiomed, Danvers, MA, USA) has become an important adjunct treatment modality in bridging patients with end-stage heart failure to recovery or orthotopic heart transplantation (HTx). We compared the outcome of patients directly bridged to HTx with the Impella 5.0 versus patients without mechanical circulatory support (MCS). Patients with no previous sternotomy or MCS, who were transplanted between September 2014 and March 2019 were included in this retrospective analysis. Impella 5.0 was implanted using surgical access and transesophageal echocardiography guidance. Forty-two out of 155 transplanted patients fulfilled the insertion criteria. Eight (19%) were bridged with Impella 5.0 to HTx. Recipient and donor baseline characteristics were comparable in both groups. There were no significant differences in survival between the groups at 30-day (94% no MCS vs. 87.5% Impella group, P = .47) or 6 months (94% vs. 87.5%, P = .51). Patients on Impella 5.0 showed a significant recovery of hemodynamic parameters and end-organ function. Average duration of support to HTx was 16 ± 17 days. Impella 5.0, when used in suitable patients in a timely fashion can be a good strategy for bridging patients to HTx. The axillary approach allows for early extubation and mobilization. Outcomes of patients bridged to HTx with Impella 5.0 in acute cardiogenic shock are comparable to those of patients with no MCS.
