Novel biomarkers in human terminal heart failure and under mechanical circulatory support. This review summarizes recent findings on novel biochemical plasma biomarkers in terminal heart failure patients, which might predict an advanced mortality risk or even recovery. Moreover, we discussed the regulation of these heart failure-related biomarkers under mechanical circulatory support.
