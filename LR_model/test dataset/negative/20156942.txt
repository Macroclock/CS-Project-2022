Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a rescue of intractable ventricular fibrillation and bridge to heart transplantation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) systems have undergone rapid technological improvements and are now feasible options for medium-term support of severe cardiac or pulmonary failure. Intractable ventricular arrhythmia is a rare but well-established indication for heart transplantation. We report a case of persistent ventricular fibrillation (VF) that was rescued by insertion of peripheral veno-arterial ECMO during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which provided support for 30 h of continuous VF and subsequently permitted urgent heart transplantation.
