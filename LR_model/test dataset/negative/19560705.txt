Ventricular assist device application with the intermediate use of a membrane oxygenator as a bridge to pediatric heart transplantation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and ventricular assist devices are currently used for the treatment of severe heart failure as a bridge to transplantation. The use of ventricular assist devices is limited by respiratory failure. We report a patient with severe heart failure and respiratory failure who was successfully bridged to transplantation, initially with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and afterwards with an EXCOR biventricular assist device (Berlin Heart AG, Berlin, Germany) and a membrane oxygenator (Jostra Quadrox D, Maquet Cardiopulmonary, AG Hirrlingen, Germany) intercalated in the outflow cannula of the left pump.
