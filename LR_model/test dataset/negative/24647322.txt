Back table outflow graft anastomosis technique for HeartWare HVAD implantation. The management of concomitant aortic and aortic valve disease with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation for patients with severe cardiomyopathy is challenging, and has not been established given the complexity of LVAD surgery with concomitant aortic interventions. A 45-year-old patient presented to our institution with end-stage heart failure symptoms and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient was found to have a bicuspid aortic valve, severe native aortic regurgitation, a significant ascending aortic aneurysm, and severely depressed left ventricular (LV) function requiring two inotropes. He underwent a successful hemiarch repair of the ascending aortic aneurysm using a back table outflow graft anastomosis technique, and subsequent placement of a HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device (HVAD) with concomitant aortic valve closure with a modified Park's stitch. The patient did well postoperatively and is currently listed for heart transplantation.
