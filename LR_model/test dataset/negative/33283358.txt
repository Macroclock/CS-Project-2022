Impact of implantation time on early function of cardiac transplant. Data on out-of-ice implantation ischemia in heart transplant are scarce. We examined implantation time's impact on allograft dysfunction. We conducted a single-site retrospective review of all primary adult heart transplants from June 2012 to August 2019 for implantation warm ischemic time (WIT), defined as first atrial stitch to aortic crossclamp removal. Univariate regression was used to assess the relationship of perioperative variables to primary graft dysfunction (PGD) and to pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi) at postoperative hour 24. A threshold of p < .10 was set for the inclusion of covariates in multivariate regression. Secondary analyses evaluated for consistency among alternative criteria for allograft dysfunction. A post hoc subgroup analysis examined WIT effect in prolonged total ischemia of 240 min or longer. Complete data were available for 201 patients. Baseline characteristics were similar between patients who did and did not have WIT documented. In univariate analysis, female gender, longer total ischemic time (TIT), longer bypass time, greater blood transfusions, and pretransplant intensive care unit (ICU) care were associated with PGD, whereas longer bypass time was associated with worse PAPi and pretransplant ICU care was associated with better PAPi. In multivariate analysis, longer bypass time predicted PGD, and worse PAPi and preoperative ICU admission predicted PGD and better PAPi. Results did not differ in secondary or subgroup analyses. This study is one of few examining the functional impact of cardiac implantation ischemia. Results suggest allograft implantation time alone may not impact postoperative graft function, which was driven by intraoperative bypass duration and by preoperative ICU care, instead.
