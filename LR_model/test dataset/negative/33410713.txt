Minimally Invasive Left Ventricular Assist Device Insertion Facilitates Subsequent Heart Transplant. We have observed that minimally invasive left ventricular assist device (LVAD) insertion leads to more facile re-entry and easier cardiac transplantation. We hypothesize minimally invasive LVAD implantation results in improved outcomes at the time of subsequent heart transplant. All adults undergoing cardiac transplantation between October 2015 and March 2019 at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Those bridged to transplantation with a HeartWare HVAD were identified and divided into 2 cohorts based upon the surgical approach: those who underwent HVAD placement by conventional sternotomy versus minimally invasive insertion via lateral thoracotomy and hemisternotomy (LTHS). Patient demographics, as well as perioperative transplant outcomes, including survival, length of stay (LOS), blood utilization, ischemic time, bypass time, and postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were compared between cohorts. Forty-two patients were bridged to heart transplant with a HVAD implanted via either sternotomy ( Minimally invasive HVAD implantation improves outcomes at subsequent heart transplantation, resulting in shorter LOS and less red cell transfusion. Larger multi-institutional studies are necessary to validate these findings. 'length of stay', 'minimally invasive', 'transfusion', 'transplant', 'ventricular assist device'
