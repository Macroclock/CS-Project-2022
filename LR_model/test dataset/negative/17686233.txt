[Lung and heart-lung transplantation for Eisenmenger syndrome: report of 5 cases]. To discuss the operative indications and peri-operational management of single lung transplantation (SLT) and heart-lung transplantation (HLT) for patients suffering from Eisenmenger's syndrome (ES). From September.2002 to March.2006, four ES patients, 1 males and 3 females, aged 16 approximately 19, 2 with atrial septal defect and 2 with ventricular septal defect, underwent single right lung transplantation, and one patients, male, aged 43, who suffered heart failure secondary to an interventional occlusion for atrial septal defect underwent cardiac repair and HLT. Two patients, including the patient who received HLT and one, female, aged 15, who received SHT died of he died primary graft dysfunction on the 23rd day and 20th day post-operationally respectively. While the other 3 recipients kept a normal life for 5, 8, and 22 months respectively after operation with apparently decreased pulmonary artery pressure and improved cardiac-pulmonary functions. Lung transplantation companies with cardiac repair is effective in the therapy of ES. Donor-recipient matching in size, proper removal and protection of the donor lung, and appropriate postoperational management are the key procedures for those patients to survive.
