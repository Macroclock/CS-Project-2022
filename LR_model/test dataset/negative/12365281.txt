[Heart assist systems--current status]. Heart failure is the leading cause of death in the developed countries. Organ-preserving operative procedures on the failing heart like coronary artery bypass procedures or resection of left ventricular aneurysms are part of the routine care in cardiac surgery today. Terminal heart failure refractory to optimized drug therapy, however, will require a heart transplantation or the implantation of artificial blood pumps. While heart transplantation has proven to provide excellent long-term results with 10-year survival rates at 50%, it will remain a casuistic therapy, limited by the comparatively small number of procedures which can be performed. The current status of development of artificial blood pumps is represented by the broad availability of partially-implantable electric motor-driven left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), which still require a percutaneous cable for energy supply and device control from external sources while the blood pump itself resides inside the body. The recently introduced axial-flow devices (DeBakey, Jarvik 2000 and HeartMate II LVADs) deliver a continuous blood flow and obviously provide distinct advantages with regard to a reduction in size, weight and energy demands, simplified implantation technique and device control when compared to the previously available partially-implantable electric motor-driven pulsatile blood pumps (Novacor N100, TCl Heart Mate LVADs). The first systems designed for long-term or permanent use (Lion Heart LVAD, AbioCor replacement heart) are completely implantable devices featuring percutaneous energy transmission and device control. However, the latter are more complex devices and their clinical application is still limited to a small number of cases, which precludes a judgment about their potential at this time. The use of paracorporeal pneumatically accentuated blood pump systems is still indicated in cases of most severe biventricular heart failure and multiorgan failure or if only short- to mid-term circulatory support is anticipated. Well established indications for utilization of artificial blood pumps are the bridge-to-transplant procedure, which yields results comparable to primary heart transplantation, and acute cardiac failure following myocardial infarction or cardiac surgical procedures. In newborns and children, encouraging results were obtained when miniaturized blood pumps of the Berlin Heart System were utilized for heart failure in myocarditis or dilative cardiomyopathy. With advanced reliability of artificial blood pumps and in face of the high incidence of heart failure, especially in the older age group, the long-term application of artificial bloods pump appears to be justified.
