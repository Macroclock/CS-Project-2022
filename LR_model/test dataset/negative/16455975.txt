CD8 T cells specific for a donor-derived, self-restricted transplant antigen are nonpathogenic bystanders after vascularized heart transplantation in mice. CD8 T cell cross-priming, an established mechanism of protective antiviral immunity, was originally discovered during studies involving minor transplantation Ags. It is unclear whether or how cross-primed CD8 T cells, reactive to donor-derived, but recipient class I MHC-restricted epitopes, could injure a fully MHC-disparate, vascularized transplant. To address this question we studied host class I MHC-restricted, male transplantation Ag-reactive T cell responses in female recipients of fully MHC-disparate, male heart transplants. Cross-priming to the immune-dominant determinant HYUtyp occurred at low frequency after heart transplantation. CD8 T cell preactivation through immunization with HYUtyp mixed in CFA did not alter the kinetics of acute rejection. Furthermore, neither HYUtyp immunization nor adoptive transfer of HYUtyp-specific TCR-transgenic T cells affected outcome in 1) a model of chronic rejection in the absence of immunosuppression or 2) a model of allograft acceptance induced by costimulatory blockade. The results support the contention that CD8 T cells reactive to host-restricted, but donor-derived, Ags are highly specific and are nonpathogenic bystanders during rejection of MHC-disparate cardiac allografts.
