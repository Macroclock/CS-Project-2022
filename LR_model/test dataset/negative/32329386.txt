Effects of implanting a long-term left ventricle assist device on post-transplant outcomes. An increasing number of patients are receiving left ventricle assist devices as a bridge to heart transplantation. The aim of this study was to determine the difference between patients who received transplants from a left ventricle assist device and those who underwent heart transplantation without a prior left ventricle assist device implantation. The study included patients who underwent heart transplantation in our institute between January 2010 and November 2018. The following clinical variables were evaluated: donor characteristics, patient's pre-transplant demographical data, post-transplant data, and patient survival. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy progression was prospectively examined (after 1 month and 12 months after heart transplantation) by coronary optical coherence tomography. We were interested in the difference in 1- and 5-year survival between the left ventricle assist device and non-left ventricle assist device groups. A total of 248 patients were identified; out of them, 48 patients received a left ventricle assist device before heart transplantation, whereas 200 had transplants with no prior left ventricle assist device implantation. There were no significant differences in any donor characteristics. The mean duration of cardiopulmonary bypass time in the non-left ventricle assist device group was 156 versus 175 min in the left ventricle assist device group ( Our results indicate that patients undergoing heart transplantation from left ventricle assist devices suffer significantly more from intraoperative and post-operative complications; however, only insignificant cardiac allograft vasculopathy progression and survival differences between the two groups were observed.
