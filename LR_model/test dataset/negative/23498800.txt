Total arterial anastomosis heterotopic heart transplantation model. Mouse transplant models offer a valuable platform for studying the biology of a spectrum of diseases, particularly those of the immune system. We have developed a modified abdominal heterotopic heart transplantation (AHHT) model with a total arterial anastomosis and compared the results with the cervical heterotopic heart transplantation (CHHT) and the non-modified AHHT models. Mice were randomly assigned to four groups: sham, AHHT, CHHT, and modified AHHT groups. Each group (except for the sham) included donor and recipient animals. Postoperative outcome, operative mortality, operative time, and tissue damage were assessed by measuring plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor Î±. The modified AHHT group had significantly lower values. However, hind limb paralysis was observed equally and only in AHHT and modified AHHT models. The modified AHHT group had the highest success rate of functioning hearts.
