Letermovir successfully used for secondary prophylaxis in a heart transplant recipient with ganciclovir-resistant cytomegalovirus syndrome (UL97 mutation). Letermovir was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2017 for use in adult cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seropositive allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients for primary prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease. We report off-label use of letermovir for secondary prophylaxis of genotype-confirmed ganciclovir-resistant cytomegalovirus (CMV) syndrome (UL 97 mutation [C603W]) in a heart transplant recipient initially treated with intravenous cidofovir followed by foscarnet, both discontinued due to unacceptable toxicities.
