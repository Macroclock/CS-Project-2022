First successful combined heart and kidney transplant in Iran: a case report. Combined heart and kidney transplant has become an accepted therapy for patients with coexisting heart and kidney failure. This method, compared with single-organ transplant, has a better outcome. Here, we report the first successful combined heart and kidney transplant in Iran. The patient was a 36-year-old man with end-stage renal disease owing to IgA nephropathy, admitted to Masih Daneshvari Hospital in Tehran, Iran for progressive dyspnea and chest pain. In-patient evaluations revealed cardiomyopathy leading to end-stage heart failure. Owing to concurrent heart and kidney end-stage diseases, combined cardiorenal transplant was done. Eight months after his transplant, routine follow-ups have not shown any signs of acute rejection. He is now New York Heart Association functional class I. Both cardiac and renal functions are within normal ranges. Good outcome during follow-up for this case justifies simultaneous heart plus kidney transplants as an alternate treatment for patients with advanced disease of both organs.
