A blocking anti-CD28-specific antibody induces long-term heart allograft survival by suppression of the PKC theta-JNK signal pathway. This study investigated the effects of a blocking anti-CD28 antibody (Anti-CD28-PV1-IgG3) in vitro and in vivo. Anti-CD28-PV1-IgG3, a hamster-mouse chimeric antibody against murine CD28, which does not provide CD28-positive signaling during TCR-driven T cell activation, enabled long-term survival of heart allografts across a complete mismatch of the MHC in rats. Among the T cell signaling proteins tested in the spleens from recipients, we found that recipients treated with anti-CD28-PV1-IgG3 exhibited suppression of alloantigen-initiated proximal TCR signaling events, including Lck, Zap70, Vav, and PI3K expression, and their PKC theta- and JNK-regulated expression/activation. This leads to attenuation of intragraft T cell infiltration and expression of T cell effector molecules. These results indicate that targeting the CD28 receptor with a blocking antibody leads to long-term allograft survival by reducing activation of alloantigen-mediated key signaling events in T cells that might be crucial for full T cell activation.
