Effect of CYP3A5, CYP3A4, and ABCB1 genotypes as determinants of tacrolimus dose and clinical outcomes after heart transplantation. Tacrolimus (Tac) is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A isoenzymes. In a cohort of heart transplant recipients, we investigated the effect of CYP3A5, CYP3A4, and ABCB1/MDR1 polymorphisms on Tac dose requirements and the risk of developing new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT). A total of 65 heart transplant recipients were genotyped for 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CYP3A5 (SNP rs776746), CYP3A4 (SNP rs2740574), and ABCB1 (SNP rs104564). The mean Tac dose values were compared between the genotypes. CYP3A5 3 homozygotes (nonexpressers; n = 55, 85%) received significantly higher Tac dose compared with CYP3A5 1 carriers (expressers). No different NODAT frequencies were found between the genotypes. The CYP3A5 polymorphism was the main determinant of Tac dose requirements among heart transplant recipients. This common functional polymorphism had no influence on the risk of developing NODAT.
