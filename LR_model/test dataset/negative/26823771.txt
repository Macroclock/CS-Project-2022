Role of MICA expression, anti-MICA antibodies and serum MICA during acute rejection in a rat-to-mouse cardiac transplantation model. Human major histocompatibility complex class I-related gene A (MICA) is reportedly associated with poor transplant outcomes and a high risk of acute and chronic rejection in solid organ transplantation. However, studies on these risks have found conflicting results. In the present study, we investigate the MICA expression and serum MICA (sMICA) as well as the MICA antibodies (anti-MICA) in serum of recipients during acute rejection (AR) in a rat-to-mouse cardiac transplantation model. Construct rat-to-mouse concordant cardiac transplantation models, histological examination of the heart in recipients during AR at 2-6 hours time point was done. We then studied the MICA gene expression of the heart in recipients during AR at 2-6 hours time point by western blot and RT-PCR assay. We latter studied the anti-MICA and sMICA levels in serum of recipients during AR at 2-6 hours time point by Flow cytometry and ELISA measurement. We found that Lewis rat hearts transplanted into BALB/c mice developed typical AR in 6 days. The level of severity of xenograft rejection from 2 d to 6 d was increased in a time-dependant way. MICA protein and MICA mRNA was also increased in time-dependant way and reached the highest value at 6 h. The prevalence of anti-MICA was significantly higher among those with severe acute rejection. However, sMICA was significantly increased during AR at 2 hours, then gradually decreased, and reached the lowest value at 6 h. MICA expression in recipients' heart and anti-MICA antibodies in recipients' sera may associated with high risk of AR in rat-to-mouse transplantation. sMICA showed a negative association with acute rejection and may be a good predictor of heart transplant outcomes.
