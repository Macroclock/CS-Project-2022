Synergistic effects of alpha-1,2-fucosyltransferase, DAF, and CD59 in suppression of xenogenic immunological responses. Previous studies showed that alpha-1,2-fucosyltransferase (HT), decay accelerating factor (DAF), and CD59 have an inhibitory effect on the immunological rejection of xenogenic transplantation. To investigate their possible synergistic effects in suppression of heterogeneic transplantation, we produced transgenic mouse lines expressing human HT, DAF, and/or CD59 by the standard pronuclear injection approach. PCR and Southern blot were used to identify the transgenic founder lines. Flow cytometry confirmed the high-level expression of HT, DAF, or CD59 in the transgenic mice. The deposition of IgM, C3c, or C9 in the cardiac vascular endothelial cells of the HT, HT/CD59, and/or DAF multiple positive transgenic mice was markedly decreased. The survival time and function of the hearts of the co-transgenic mice were significantly longer and higher than that of the single HT-positive transgenic mice (P < 0.05). The mice co-expressing HT/DAF or HT/CD59 could resist the hyperacute rejection better than those expressing HT alone. It is feasible to use HT and C-reactive proteins co-transgenic tissues to resist hyperacute rejection and xenograft rejection.
