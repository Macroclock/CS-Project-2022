Urgent liver, heart, and lung transplantation programs in Italy: activities and evaluation of outcomes. The Italian national transplantation network has set up programs for liver, heart, and lung transplantation in urgent conditions. The aim of this study was to analyze the capability of these programs to meeting needs and their quality. In period between 2008 and 2011, the total number of urgent transplant requests was analyzed by organ, reason, and outcome, namely waiting time, graft origin, and number of transplantations with their one- and three-year graft survivals. There were urgent requests for 312 livers, 268 hearts, and 43 lungs totted among which 72%, 63%, and 79% were met, respectively. Actuarial graft survival rates at one and three years were 62% and 61% for liver and 73.1% and 70.5% for heart transplantations, respectively. The rate of satisfied requests and the graft outcomes showed that the national urgency programs meet the healthcare needs of patients with a short life expectancy, achieving good quality donor-recipient match.
