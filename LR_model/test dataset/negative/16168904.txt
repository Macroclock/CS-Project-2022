Incidental detection of an asymptomatic papillary fibroelastoma on a control biopsy of a heart transplant recipient. Papillary fibroelastoma (PFE) of the right ventricle is a rare lesion. This tumor has not been described in the heart of a cardiac transplant recipient. We report a 42-year-old woman suffering from chronic ischemic cardiopathy who underwent an orthotopic cardiac transplantation. Five years after surgery, the control two-dimensional echocardiography showed no abnormalities. At this time, the programmed endomyocardial biopsies of the right ventricle included a 2-mm lesion that was diagnosed as PFE. To our knowledge, only a previous case of this tumor has been detected at random in a control cardiac biopsy. Differential diagnosis includes chordae tendinae removed at the time of cardiac sampling, Lambl excrescence, and myxoma. PFE can arise in a cardiac transplant recipient and may be detected on a random programmed biopsy.
