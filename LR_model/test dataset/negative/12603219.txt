Rapamycin as rescue therapy in a patient supported by biventricular assist device to heart transplantation with consecutive ongoing rejection. Rapamycin is a new immunosuppressive agent that has been shown to be effective in acute heart allograft rejection. This case documents a patient suffering from cardiac sarcoidosis who was bridged to transplantation for 90 days with ongoing rejection after allograft implantation. Rejection did not abate despite treatment with antithymocyte globulin (ATG), FK506, a mycophenolate switch and courses of multiple apheresis. Initiation of rapamycin treatment resulted in a rapid resolution of cardiac rejection and reduction of concomitant immunosuppressive agents with few side-effects. Most notably was the reduction of panel reactive antibodies within a few weeks after the rapamycin initiation. This case illustrates that the utilization of rapamycin ceased ongoing rejection in a patient with a clear hyperimmune state despite prior extensive utilization of a variety of immunosuppressive strategies after heart transplantation.
