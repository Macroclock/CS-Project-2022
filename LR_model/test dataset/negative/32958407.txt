Combined heart-lung transplantation from a donation after circulatory death donor. Combined heart-lung transplantation is the optimal treatment option for many patients with end-stage heart failure and fixed severe pulmonary hypertension. It offers the only possibility of long-term survival and a return to a normal quality of life. Unfortunately, it is rarely performed because of donor organ allocation policies. We present the case of a critically ill 24-year-old man, who after waiting for >100 days in-hospital on the urgent transplant list, deteriorated further and underwent the first successful heart-lung transplant with organs from a donation after circulatory death.
