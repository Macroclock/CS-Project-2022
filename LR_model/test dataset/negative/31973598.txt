Healthy Hearts via Live Videoconferencing: An Exercise and Diet Intervention in Pediatric Heart Transplant Recipients. Background Pediatric heart transplant recipients have high-risk cardiovascular profiles that can affect their long-term outcomes; however, promoting exercise and healthy diet has not been a major focus in the field. The objective of this study was to test the feasibility and impact of a supervised exercise and diet intervention delivered via live videoconferencing in this population. Methods and Results Patients 8 to 19 years of age at least 1 year post heart transplantation were enrolled. The 12- to 16-week intervention phase included live video-supervised exercise (×3/week) and nutrition (×1/week) sessions. The 12- to 16-week maintenance phase included ×1/week live video-supervised exercise and nutrition sessions and ×2/week self-directed exercise sessions. Cardiac, vascular, nutritional, and functional health indices were obtained at baseline, after intervention, and after maintenance. Fourteen patients (median age, 15.2; interquartile range, 14.3-16.7 years) at a median of 3.3 (interquartile range, 1.5-9.7) years after heart transplant completed the intervention. Patients attended 89.6±11% of exercise and 88.4±10% of nutrition sessions during the intervention and 93.4±11% of exercise and 92.3±11% of nutrition sessions during maintenance. After intervention, body mass index percentile (median, -27%;  'endothelial function', 'exercise', 'heart transplant', 'live videoconferencing'
