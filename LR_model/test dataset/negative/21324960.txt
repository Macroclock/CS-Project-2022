Aortic root spontaneous echocardiographic contrast due to haemodynamic support with a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (TandemHeart). Intra-procedural transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is useful in guiding device placement and monitoring for procedural complications in the interventional lab. We report a case of spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) formation in the aortic root immediately following initiation of haemodynamic support with a percutaneous left ventricular (LV) assist device for cardiogenic shock. With TEE guidance, assist device flow rates were adjusted, resulting in resolution of SEC. This case illustrates another potential use for intra-procedural TEE during LV assist device placement.
