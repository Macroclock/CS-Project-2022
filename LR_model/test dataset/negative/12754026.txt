Mechanical limitation of pulmonary blood flow facilitates heart transplantation in older infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Progression of pulmonary vascular disease limits heart transplantation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) to early infancy. Our objective was to assess the impact of bilateral pulmonary artery banding (PAB) on the operative courses of HLHS infants transplanted at ages older than 4 months. Courses of all HLHS patients in our center who remained listed to age >or=120 days before heart transplantation were assessed. Patients undergoing transplantation after standard management (control group) were compared to patients having a prior pulmonary blood flow limiting procedure (PAB group). Of 16 identified patients, one crossed over to stage I Norwood on day 185 and died post-operatively. Fifteen patients were transplanted at age >or=120 days (control group n=9, PAB group n=6). Four PAB patients had open PA band placement. Two PAB patients underwent experimental percutaneous bilateral internal pulmonary artery flow limiting device insertion. The PAB group mean age at banding was 141+/-54 days, and mean interval from PAB to transplant was 35+/-31 days (range 1.5-68 days). No differences in age at transplant, weight at transplant, warm graft ischemia time or total graft ischemia time were detected between groups. Mean times of mechanical ventilation (control 143+/-69h vs. PAB 44+/-13h), inhaled nitric oxide (control 126+/-70h vs. PAB 37+/-9h), inotropic support (control 171+/-64h vs. PAB 87+/-17h), intensive care unit (ICU) stay (control 8.3+/-2.7 days vs. PAB 4.5+/-1.4 days), and hospital stay (control 10.4+/-3.9 days vs. PAB 7.0+/-1.1 days) were all lower in the PAB group (P<0.05 all comparisons). Two control patients died, three required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and six did not tolerate primary chest closure. No PAB patient died or required ECMO. All PAB patients tolerated primary chest closure. All PAB patients had widely patent branch pulmonary arteries with no re-interventions to date. All hospital survivors remain alive (mean follow-up, control 50.2 months, PAB 11.5 months). Pre-transplant mechanical limitation of pulmonary blood flow simplified management and reduced morbidity for HLHS patients undergoing heart transplantation at ages >or=4 months. This strategy extends the permissible transplant waiting time in older infants with HLHS.
