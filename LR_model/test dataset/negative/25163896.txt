Differential effect of body mass index on pediatric heart transplant outcomes based on diagnosis. The impact of nutritional status on HTx waitlist mortality in children is unknown, and there are conflicting data regarding the role of nutrition in post-HTx survival. This study examined the influence of nutrition on waitlist and post-HTx outcomes in children. Children 2-18 yr listed for HTx from 1997 to 2011 were identified from the OPTN database and stratified by BMI percentile. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated the influence of BMI on waitlist mortality. Cox proportional hazard regression assessed the impact of BMI on post-HTx mortality. When all 2712 patients were analyzed, BMI did not impact waitlist, one-, or five-yr mortality. However, when stratified by diagnosis, BMI > 95% (AOR 1.96; 95% CI 1.24, 3.09) and BMI < 1% (AOR 2.17; 95% CI 1.28, 3.68) were independent risk factors for waitlist mortality in patients with CM. BMI did not impact waitlist mortality in CHD and did not impact post-HTx outcomes, regardless of diagnosis. BMI > 95% and BMI < 1% are independent risk factors for waitlist mortality in patients with CM, but not CHD. This suggests differing risk factors based on disease etiology, and an individualized approach to risk assessment based on diagnosis may be warranted.
