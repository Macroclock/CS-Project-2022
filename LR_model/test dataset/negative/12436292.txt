[Chimerism of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in chronic myeloid leukemia. An autopsy study]. The results of a number of animal experimental studies are in keeping with the finding that hematopoietic progenitors can generate cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. As a consequence innovative therapeutic strategies have been suggested to possibly ameliorate the outcome of coronary artery disease. However, there is no information available at present whether this pathomechanism is also effective in humans, in particular without prior ischemic lesion of the myocardium. Therefore an autopsy study was performed on cadaver hearts derived from five male patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who received full unmanipulated bone marrow grafts from female donors 21-631 days before death. The purpose of this investigation was to detect and quantify a putative chimerism of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells (intramural and subepicardial vessels). Genotyping was carried out by applying X- or Y-chromosome-specific DNA probes (fluorescence in-situ hybridisation) on routinely formalin-fixed specimens of the myocardium. To test the sensitivity of our method, cadaver hearts from two males and two females without a history of transplantation served as controls. In contrast to a totally corresponding sex-matched genotyping in 780 cardiomyocytes and 155 endothelial cells of the control group, the five male patients with a previous transplantation revealed significantly different results. A mixed chimerism was identifiable in 57 out of 890 counted cardiomyocytes (6.4%) and in 19 out of 322 endothelial cells (5.8%). These findings support the assumption that in addition to endothelial cells there is also a cardiomyogenic potential of bone marrow stem cells which exists without prior (ischemic) damage to the heart. However, further investigations are necessary to identify, isolate and enrich the cardiomyocytic stem cells more specifically for future curative therapeutic options in patients with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy.
