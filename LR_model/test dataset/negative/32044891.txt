A Predictive Model for Intracardiac Pressures in Patients Free From Rejection or Allograft Vasculopathy After Pediatric Heart Transplantation. Despite the routine use of hemodynamic assessment in pediatric heart transplant (HT) patients, expected intracardiac pressure measurements in patients free of significant complications are incompletely described. A better understanding of the range of intracardiac pressures in these HT patients is important for the clinical interpretation of these indices and consequent management of patients. We conducted a retrospective chart review of pediatric HT recipients who had undergone HT between January 2010 and December 2015 at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. We analyzed intracardiac pressures measured in the first 12 mo after HT. We excluded those with rejection, graft coronary artery disease, mechanical support, or hemodialysis. We used a longitudinal general additive model with bootstrapping technique to generate age and donor-recipient size-specific curves to characterize filling pressures through 1-y post-HT. Pressure measurements from the right atrium, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were obtained in 85 patients during a total of 829 catheterizations. All pressure measurements were elevated in the immediate post-HT period and decreased to a stable level by post-HT day 90. Pressure measurements were not affected by age group, donor-recipient size differences, or ischemic time. Intracardiac pressures are elevated in the early post-HT period and decrease to levels typical of the native heart by 90 d. Age, donor-to-recipient size differences, and ischemic time do not contribute to differences in expected intracardiac pressures in the first year post-HT.
