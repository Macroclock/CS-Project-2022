Radio-frequency catheter ablation of accessory pathway mediated tachycardia in a child after orthotopic heart transplantation. Successful radio-frequency catheter ablation of accessory pathway mediated supraventricular tachycardia in the transplanted heart has been reported sporadically in adults, but has not been reported in children. This is the first report of a child having received a donor heart with manifest pre-excitation and who subsequently underwent successful radio-frequency ablation of the accessory pathway.
