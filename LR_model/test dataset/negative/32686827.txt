Attenuating ischemia/reperfusion injury in rat cardiac transplantation by intracoronary infusion with siRNA cocktail solution. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), caspase-8, and complement component 5a receptor (C5aR) are known to play a crucial role in the myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in cardiac transplantation. We hypothesized that the intracoronary infusion of TNF-α, caspase-8, and C5aR small interfering RNAs (siRNA) would protect cardiac allograft function and improve graft survival from I/R injury-induced organ failure. I/R injury of cardiac allograft was induced by syngeneic rat cardiac transplantation, in which the transplanted hearts were infused with saline or different amounts of siRNA cocktail solution targeting TNF-α, caspase-8, and C5aR via coronary arteries, and subsequently subjected to 18 h of preservation at 4°C in histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution. The effects of siRNA cocktail solution on prolonged cold I/R injury were determined by assessing graft survival, histopathological changes, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration. The perfused siRNA cocktail solution successfully knocked down the expression of TNF-α, caspase-8, and C5aR in vitro and in vivo. Approximately 91.7% of control hearts that underwent 18 h of cold ischemia ceased their function after transplantation; however, 87.5% of cardiac allografts from the highest dose siRNA cocktail solution-pretreated hearts survived >14 days and exhibited minimal histological changes, with minimal cellular infiltration, interstitial edema, and inflammation and maximal reduced MPO activity and MDA concentration in the cardiac allograft. We demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of infusion of TNF-α, caspase-8, and C5aR siRNA via the intracoronary route as a promising strategy for gene silencing against I/R injury in cardiac transplantation.
