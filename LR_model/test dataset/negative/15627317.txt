Heart-lung transplantation in Korea. Heart-lung transplantation is an effective treatment for patients with various forms of congenital heart disease or pulmonary hypertension. Since the first heart-lung transplantation in 1997, five transplants have been performed in Korea. Three cases were performed in 1997, one in 1998, and the latest one in 2002. The preoperative diagnoses were complex congenital heart disease (CHD) in 2, and CHD with Eisenmenger's syndrome in 3. In this paper, we report five cases of heart-lung transplantation performed in Korea, and include a review of the relevant literature.
