[Cardiological functional diagnostics]. Cardiovascular diseases are common; therefore, adequate and guideline-based diagnostics and treatment are essential. In addition to an electrocardiogram (ECG) and (treadmill) exercise tests, echocardiography plays the pivotal role in functional cardiac testing. It is permanently available at the bedside and has a high diagnostic accuracy; however, examinations such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) as well as nuclear medical imaging, e.g. single proton emission CT (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are becoming more and more common in clinical practice. This is due to the wide range of additional information and the high diagnostic accuracy. In the following article, the individual possibilities of non-invasive cardiac functional testing are presented and their meaningful application will be discussed; however, studies on the meaningful application of non-invasive diagnostics are scarce.
