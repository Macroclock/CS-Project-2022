Aspergillus fumigatus endocarditis in a pediatric liver transplant recipient: favorable outcome without cardiac surgery. Transplant recipients are very susceptible to invasive aspergillosis, which increases mortality rate. Disseminated aspergillosis in the liver transplant recipient can affect virtually any organ and endocarditis is often lethal despite cardiac surgery and antifungal therapy. We report the case of a eight-month-old girl who presented with Aspergillus fumigatus endocarditis 18 days after liver transplantation that was successfully treated by a combination of antifungal drugs associated to a low dosage of immunosuppressive therapy.
