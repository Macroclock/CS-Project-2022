Sizing heart transplant donors in adults with congenital heart disease. Optimal donor sizing for heart transplantation (HT) in adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) remains unclear, given the propensity for pulmonary hypertension related to shunting, staged repairs, and periods of pulmonary overcirculation. We studied HT outcomes related to donor size matching in the adult CHD population. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of patients with CHD undergoing HT in the United States from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2015. Patients were selected from the United Network for Organ Sharing database; 827 patients met inclusion criteria and were analyzed. At a median follow-up of 1462 days, 548 (66.3%) subjects were alive and 279 (33.7%) were deceased. All-cause mortality did not differ based on donor sizing (by predicted heart mass ratio: hazard ratio, 1.03; confidence interval, 0.86-1.23; P = .74). Pulmonary hypertension was not significantly associated with survival (by predicted heart mass ratio, χ Our data demonstrate that donor oversizing, to the extent used in current practice, does not affect survival after HT in adults with CHD. Our findings from the United Network for Organ Sharing database demonstrate that donor oversizing in these patients is not associated with improved mortality.
