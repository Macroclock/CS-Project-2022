Pediatric cardiac transplants: a clinical update. In the last 10 years more than 2,600 pediatric patients have received heart transplants. The survival rate at 10 years is 65% (Blume, 2003). There have been profound improvements in the survival and quality of life associated with pediatric heart transplants. Due to the increase in survival and quality of life, it is becoming more common for nurses to care for these unique patients. Nurses need to be aware of the complex management of pediatric heart transplant patients to aid in their care of these patients. This paper will discuss the transplant process, medications, common complications, and psychosocial impact associated with pediatric heart transplants to better prepare nurses involved in the care of pediatric cardiac transplant patients.
