Sequential therapy of primary cardiac lymphoma with cardiectomy, total artificial heart support, and cardiac transplantation. Primary cardiac T-cell lymphoma is an extremely rare entity, with only 3 patients having been reported so far in the literature. We describe the case of a young patient with acute heart failure involving the whole myocardium. The patient successfully underwent emergency cardiectomy, custom-made total artificial heart implantation and heart transplantation, combined with chemotherapy. The problems we encountered with this rare disease are discussed and compared with those of previous studies.
