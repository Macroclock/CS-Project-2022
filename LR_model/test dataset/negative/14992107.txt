Beating heart coronary artery bypass surgery after orthotopic heart transplantation. Beating-heart coronary artery bypass surgery was performed in a 52-year-old man with accelerated transplant coronary artery disease 10 years after orthotopic heart transplantation. Transplant coronary artery disease was first detected in the left circumflex coronary artery 9 years after transplantation. Rapid progression to triple vessel disease occurred within 1 year, and the patient developed worsening symptoms of shortness of breath and chest pain. He underwent off-pump "beating heart" left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery bypass surgery. The circumflex coronary artery was not graftable due to diffuse and truncated small vessel disease. His postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged on the fifth postoperative day. Coronary angiography 3 months after the surgery revealed a widely patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery bypass. He is alive and symptom free more than 1 year after his surgery.
