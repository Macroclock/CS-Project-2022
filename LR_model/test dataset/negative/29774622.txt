Pediatric marginal donor hearts: Trends in US national use, 2005-2014. Pediatric patients awaiting heart transplant face high mortality rates due to donor organ shortages, including non-use of marginal donor hearts. We examined national trends in pediatric marginal donor heart use over time. UNOS data were queried for heart donors <18 years from 2005 to 2014. The proportion of donor hearts considered marginal was determined using previously cited marginal characteristics: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50%, use of ≥2 inotropes, cerebrovascular death, CDC high-risk status, and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 'cardiac', 'donor', 'heart', 'marginal', 'pediatric', 'transplant'
