The epigenetic promise to improve prognosis of heart failure and heart transplantation. Heart transplantation is still the only possible life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure, the critical epilogue of several cardiac diseases. Epigenetic mechanisms are being intensively investigated because they could contribute to establishing innovative diagnostic and predictive biomarkers, as well as ground-breaking therapies both for heart failure and heart transplantation rejection. DNA methylation and histone modifications can modulate the innate and adaptive immune response by acting on the expression of immune-related genes that, in turn, are crucial determinants of transplantation outcome. Epigenetic drugs acting on methylation and histone-modification pathways may modulate Treg activity by acting as immunosuppressive agents. Moreover, the identification of non-invasive and reliable epigenetic biomarkers for the prediction of allograft rejection and for monitoring immunosuppressive therapies represents an attractive perspective in the management of transplanted patients. MiRNAs seem to fit particularly well to this purpose because they are differently expressed in patients at high and low risk of rejection and are detectable in biological fluids besides biopsies. Although increasing evidence supports the involvement of epigenetic tags in heart failure and transplantation, further short and long-term clinical studies are needed to translate the possible available findings into clinical setting.
