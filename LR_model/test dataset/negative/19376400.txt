Massive degeneration and atrophy of the native heart after heterotopic transplantation: a case report. Extreme myocardial degeneration leading to advanced stages of cardiomyopathy with extensive atrophy is rarely observed before patients die. However, heterotopic transplantation is a special situation wherein this phenomenon can be observed. The greater part of the failed heart shows recuperation after receiving circulatory assistance by reduction of myocardial work. Herein we have reported an unusual behavior of degenerative cardiomyopathy associated with intense myocardial apoptosis resulting in extreme ventricular atrophy after heterotopic heart transplantation. An 11-year-old girl with end-stage heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy of undetermined etiology without pulmonary hypertension underwent heterotopic cardiac transplantation with an undersized (by weight mismatch) donor heart. After 9 years heart failure reappeared due to native heart enlargement leading to allograft compression. The patient underwent native heart replacement leaving her with 2 donor hearts. Despite normal hemodynamic recuperation, the patient experienced massive arterial microemboli which led to death. Pathological studies showed exuberant myocardial degeneration in the native heart with intense atrophy of the muscle and gigantic ventricular enlargement. The left ventricle wall was extremely thin with rarefaction of cardiomyocytes and replacement by fibrosis. The right ventricle showed old extensive thrombosis. In conclusion, this report is not usual as it is not frequent to observe cardiomyopathy with an intense degree of myocardial degeneration and atrophy, because the patient dies earlier. In special situations it is possible that a recipient may have 2 donor hearts with normal hemodynamics. Heterotopic heart transplantation is a surgical alternative in a priority situation offering excellent outcomes; however, the native heart must be removed when there is compromise of the function of the heterotopic allograft.
