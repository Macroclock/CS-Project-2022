Status of bone mineral density in patients selected for cardiac transplantation. To determine the prevalence and correlates of low bone mineral density (BMD) in ambulatory outpatients with end-stage heart failure who were awaiting cardiac transplantation. Fifty-five cardiac transplant candidates with end-stage heart failure were enrolled in this study. Bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and proximal femur was determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Laboratory studies included serum alkaline phosphatase, calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. The mean proximal femur and lumbar spine Z scores were 0.3 +/- 1.1 and 0.3 +/- 1.5, respectively. The mean BMD was not lower than that of the age-and sex-matched reference population. Z scores were less than -1 in 23% at the lumbar spine and 15% at the proximal femoral neck. On the basis of T scores, osteopenia (T scores between -1 and -2.5) was present in 24% (confidence interval, 13% to 35%) of patients at the lumbar spine and in 20% (confidence interval, 10% to 30%) at the proximal femur; osteoporosis (T scores of less than -2.5) was present in 4% of the study population. Half of the patients in this study sample had elevated intact parathyroid hormone levels, and a third of the patients had low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Lumbar spine and hip BMD measurements were not significantly low relative to age and sex in ambulatory patients with heart failure awaiting cardiac transplantation.
