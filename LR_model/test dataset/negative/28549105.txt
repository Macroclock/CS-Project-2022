Outbreak of Pneumocystis jirovecii Infection Among Heart Transplant Recipients: Molecular Investigation and Management of an Interhuman Transmission. An outbreak of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) occurred among heart transplant recipients (HTR) at the outpatient clinic of a university hospital, from March to September 2015. Clinical, therapeutic, biological, and molecular data were analyzed to determine its origin and control the outbreak. Clinical and biological data regarding all HTR followed in the outpatient clinic were collected. PCP diagnosis was based on microscopy and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Investigations were performed by building a transmission map, completed by genotyping Pneumocystis isolates and by a control of chemoprophylaxis observance. Asymptomatic exposed patients were screened for colonization using real-time PCR. Among 124 HTR, 7 PCP cases were confirmed. Screening identified 3 additional patients colonized by P. jirovecii. All patients were cured, and no further cases were identified after trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis was introduced in the entire cohort. Genotyping demonstrated the same strain in all PCP cases and colonized patients. All cases were linked with possible transmission chains from 2 possible index patients. Interhuman transmission was significantly associated with more frequent visits in the outpatient clinic. Six cases were receiving atovaquone as a prophylaxis. The occurrence of PCP was significantly associated with atovaquone prophylaxis. This is the first outbreak with detailed molecular analysis in HTR so far. Genotyping and transmission chain confirmed interhuman transmission in all colonized/infected PCP cases. Outpatient clinic layout and high encounters probably caused this PCP cluster, which was controlled after systematic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis in exposed patients.
