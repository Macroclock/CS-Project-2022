Diaporthe soft tissue infection in a heart transplant patient. Infections caused by Diaporthe species are very uncommon. We describe a heart transplant recipient 14Â years post transplant who developed a soft tissue fungal infection due to a Diaporthe species that responded well to surgical excision and posaconazole therapy. The Aspergillus galactomannan index was markedly elevated, and returned to normal following treatment. Solid organ transplant patients remain at risk of infection long after transplantation and should be counseled about risk avoidance.
