Assessing palliative care need in left ventricular assist device patients and heart transplant recipients. Palliative care (PC) has gained rising attention in a holistic treatment approach to chronic heart failure (HF). It is unclear whether there is a need for PC in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients or heart transplant recipients. In a cross-sectional explorative pilot study, outpatients after heart transplantation (HTx, n = 69) or LVAD implantation (n = 21) underwent screening for palliative care (PC) need and evaluation of symptom burden and psychological distress using tools that emanated from palliative cancer care. The 'Palliative Care Screening Tool for Heart Failure Patients' revealed scores of 4.3 ± 2.2 in HTx and 6.0 ± 2.1 in LVAD patients (max. 12 points, P = 0.003), indicating the need for PC (≥5 points) in 32% of HTx and 67% of LVAD patients. Symptom burden, as assessed by MIDOS ('Minimal Documentation System for Palliative Care') scores was substantial in both groups (4.9 ± 4.7 in HTx vs 6.6 ± 5.3 in LVAD, max. 30 points, P = 0.181). 'Fatigue', 'weakness' and 'pain' were the most frequent symptoms. Using the 'Distress-Thermometer', 'clinically relevant' distress was detected in 57% of HTx and 47% of LVAD patients (P = 0.445). In the PHQ-4 ('4-Item Patient Health Questionnaire'), 45% of LVAD patients, compared to only 10% of HTx patients, reported mild symptoms of anxiety and depression. Findings reveal substantial need for PC in LVAD patients and, to a lesser extent, in heart transplant recipients, suggesting that multi-disciplinary PC should be introduced into routine aftercare.
