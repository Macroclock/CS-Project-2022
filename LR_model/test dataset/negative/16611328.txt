C4d deposition and clearance in cardiac transplants correlates with alloantibody levels and rejection in rats. Antibody-mediated rejection of human cardiac transplants is correlated with C4d deposits and macrophage infiltrates in capillaries of endomyocardial biopsies. We produced an antibody to rat C4d to study C4d deposition and clearance in Lewis rats that were sensitized with a blood transfusion from DA rats 7, 14 or 21 days before cardiac transplantation. Cyclosporin A (CsA) immunosuppression was initiated after transplantation at a dose that inhibited graft rejection, antibody production and C4d deposition in unsensitized recipients. Blood transfusion elicited high levels of circulating IgG alloantibodies, predominantly of the complement-activating IgG2b subclass, that peaked 14 days after transplantation. At this time, macrophages accumulated in capillaries, and C4d deposits were diffuse and intense on arteries, capillaries and veins. Grafts that survived 90 days in sensitized recipients still had deposits of C4d that were associated with increased interstitial fibrosis and vasculopathy in arteries. Clearance of C4d was determined by retransplanting DA cardiac allografts from Lewis recipients back to DA recipients. C4d deposits were decreased to minimal levels within 5 days after retransplantation. Thus, C4d deposition is not limited to the capillaries, but extends throughout the arterial tree, and despite formation of a covalent bond, C4d is cleared within days.
