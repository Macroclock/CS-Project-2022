Elevation of IGF-2 receptor and the possible underlying implications in end-stage heart failure patients before and after heart transplantation. Up-regulation of insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF-2R) involved in angiotensin II-induced cell apoptosis in cardiomyoblasts, and correlated with cardiomyocyte apoptosis in hypertensive rat hearts. Here, we detected IGF-2R levels and explored the possible underlying implications in end-stage heart failure (HF) patients before and after heart transplantation. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to measure cardiac IGF-2R levels. ELISA was used to detect serum IGF-2R and CD8 levels. Labelling of DNA strand breaks and dihydroethidium detection were used to determine cellular apoptosis and reactive oxygen species, respectively. Cardiac IGF-2R levels increased in end-stage HF patients (n = 11) compared with non-failing control subjects. Leu27-IGF-2, an IGF-2 analogue to activate specially the IGF-2R, could induce apoptosis and reactive oxygen species production in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. The serum IGF-2R levels were significantly higher in HF patients than those in non-failing control subjects. An unexpected observation is that the serum IGF-2R levels further increased after heart transplantation, peaked at the first month, and gradually reduced close to the levels before heart transplantation at the 6th months after heart transplantation. Serum CD8, a marker of acute rejection, had no change after heart transplantation, but IGF-2R and Granzyme B, as a ligand for the IGF-2R and a marker for CD8 T lymphocyte activation, coexisted in the transplanted hearts. Our preliminary studies suggest that elevation of IGF-2R may participate in pathological process of end-stage HF and involved in the acute cellular rejection after heart transplantation.
