Intensive glycemic control after heart transplantation is safe and effective for diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Some studies have shown increased mortality, infection, and rejection rates among diabetic (DM) compared to non-diabetic (non-DM) patients undergoing heart transplant (HT). This is a retrospective chart review of adult patients (DM, n = 26; non-DM, n = 66) undergoing HT between June 1, 2005, and July 31, 2009. Glycemic control used intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SQ) insulin protocols with a glucose target of 80-110 mg/dL. There were no significant differences between DM and non-DM patients in mean glucose levels on the IV and SQ insulin protocols. Severe hypoglycemia (glucose <40 mg/dL) did not occur on the IV protocol and was experienced by only 3 non-DM patients on the SQ protocol. Moderate hypoglycemia (glucose >40 and <60 mg/dL) occurred in 17 (19%) patients on the IV protocol and 24 (27%) on the SQ protocol. There were no significant differences between DM and non-DM patients within 30 d of surgery in all-cause mortality, treated HT rejection episodes, reoperation, prolonged ventilation, 30-d readmissions, ICU readmission, number of ICU hours, hospitalization days after HT, or infections. This study demonstrates that DM and non-DM patients can achieve excellent glycemic control post-HT with IV and SQ insulin protocols with similar surgical outcomes and low hypoglycemia rates.
