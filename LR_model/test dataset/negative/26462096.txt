Heart Transplant in Asia. The prevalence of heart failure has increased in Asia. A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction end up with advanced heart failure or end-stage heart disease. These patients may be placed on the waiting list for heart transplant. There are more than 10 countries in Asia that have an active heart transplant program. The number of heart transplants performed is limited despite an increase in the number of patients with end-stage heart failure mainly because of donor shortage, which may be related to religious belief and inefficient allocation policy.
