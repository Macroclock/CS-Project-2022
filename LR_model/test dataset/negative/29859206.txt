10-Year Experience with HLA-G in Heart Transplantation. The Human Leukocyte Antigen-G (HLA-G) is a MHC-class Ib molecule with robust immunomodulatory properties; in transplant, it inhibits cytotoxic activity of immune cells and thus has a pivotal role in protecting the allograft from immune attack. The present review details a 10-year experience investigating the influence of HLA-G on heart transplantation, allograft rejection and cardiac allograft vasculopathy development. Exploration of HLA-G in transplantation began with the initial findings of its increased expression in allograft hearts. Since then, HLA-G has been recognized as an important factor in transplant immunology. We discuss inducers of HLA-G expression, and the importance of HLA-G as a potential biomarker in allograft rejection and heart failure. We also highlight the importance of polymorphisms and how they may influence both HLA-G expression and clinical outcomes. There remains much to be done in this field, however we hope that findings from our group and other groups will ignite interest and facilitate further expansion of HLA-G research in transplantation.
