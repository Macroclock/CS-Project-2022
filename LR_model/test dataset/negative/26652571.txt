Surgery for Semilunar Valve Regurgitation During Ventricular Assist Device Support in Children. Semilunar valve regurgitation (SVR) in children on ventricular assist device (VAD) support is a difficult task. Three children with SVR prior or during VAD support, underwent uneventful semilunar valve surgery, and 2 patients were successfully bridged to heart transplantation. We conclude that surgical management of SVR during VAD support in children is feasible with low operative risk, and is mandatory to optimize VAD support while on waiting list.
