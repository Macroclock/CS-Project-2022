Outcomes following more than two decades of paediatric cardiac transplantation. There have been significant changes in the field of paediatric cardiac transplantation over the last two decades. We report experience of over 22 years from a single UK transplant centre. A total of 189 orthotopic cardiac transplants were performed in 182 children aged <18 years between March 1987 and March 2009 in our institution. Patients were identified and outcomes reviewed using the cardiopulmonary transplant database and hospital medical records. 182 patients underwent cardiac transplantation, mean age 8.3 years (0.1-17.9 years), 91 (50%) male. Mean follow-up time was 9.0 years (0.3-22.3 years). 117 patients (64%) had a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, 65 (36%) had congenital heart disease. There was no significant difference in age at transplant between the group with cardiomyopathy and the group with congenital heart disease. 32 patients (17.6%) were on mechanical support prior to transplant. Three (1.6%) patients have required long-term renal replacement therapy post transplant, and 16 (8.8%) developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. Survival was 93% at 30 days, 89% at 1 year, 85% at 5 years, 70% at 10 years and 67% at 15 years with a decrease in mortality over time. Seven patients (3.8%) were re-transplanted. Outcomes following cardiac transplantation in childhood are improving with increased experience. There has been a reduction in 30-day mortality over time.
