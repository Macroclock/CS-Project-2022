Upregulation of α-enolase in acute rejection of cardiac transplant in rat model: implications for the secretion of interleukin-17. Acute allograft rejection remains a major problem in solid organ transplantation. The enzyme α-enolase has been shown to induce an immune response in cardiac transplantation. In this study, we investigated the role of α-enolase in acute allograft rejection in a rat model of heart transplantation. Hearts from either (WF: RT1(u) ) or (Lew: RT1(1) ) rats were transplanted into (Lew: RT1(1) ) rats. No rejection occurred in the isograft group, for which the median survival time was >168 days, whereas the median survival time of the allograft group was significantly less at 10 ± 2.1 days (n = 8 per group, p < 0.001). Increased inflammation was observed in allografts, including increased α-enolase expression and increased numbers of infiltrating CD4(+) T cells (p < 0.05). By immunohistochemical staining, we confirmed that α-enolase was expressed not only in myocardial cells but also in the infiltrating lymphocytes. However, on the fifth day after transplantation, α-enolase expression was no longer observed in the lymphocytes (n = 3, p < 0.001). In contrast, no lymphocytes were found in isografts after transplantation (n = 3, p < 0.001). α-enolase expression was increased in lymphocytes, which are implicated in the acute rejection of cardiac transplants. Intragraft α-enolase inhibition may be useful as an adjuvant therapy to systemic immunosuppression in heart transplantation.
