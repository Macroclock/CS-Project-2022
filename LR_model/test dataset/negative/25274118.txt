Induction therapy, tacrolimus plasma concentration, and duration if intensive care unit stay are risk factors for peripheral leucopenia following heart transplantation. Although survival among heart recipients has increased, a limiting factor is chronic adverse effects of immunosuppression therapy. We performed a retrospective analysis of 22 patients (19 men and 3 women) with a mean age of 48 ± 12 years who underwent orthotropic heart transplantation. There were 20 (91%) patients who received induction therapy (basiliximab, Simulect, Novartis Europharm Limited). All patients were treated with standard triple immunosuppressive regimen (tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids). Patients were divided into 2 groups according to postoperative peripheral cytopenia diagnosis. There were 16 (73%) in the cytopenic group and 6 (27%) in the non-cytopenic group. Mean time of peripheral leucopenia detection was 65 ± 13 days following surgery. The blood leucocyte count was 0.98 ± 0.2 × 10(3)/mm(3) vs. 5.85 ± 0.9 × 10(3)/mm(3) in patients with peripheral cytopenia compared to non-cytopenic patients (p<0.01). There was a statistically important difference in duration of intensive care unit stay between the 2 groups (p<0.01). A correlation between tacrolimus serum concentration and risk for leucopenia was also detected (p<0.05). Basiliximab administration as induction therapy, tacrolimus serum concentration, and duration of intensive care unit stay are risk factors for leucopenia.
