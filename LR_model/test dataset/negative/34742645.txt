Gut microbes enlarged the protective effect of transplanted regulatory B cells on rejection of cardiac allografts. Regulatory B cells (Bregs) play an important role in maintaining immune homeostasis and have the potential to induce tolerance. Previous work has found that Breg cells are involved in heart transplantation tolerance. However, the effect of Breg on the transplantation tolerance and the underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified. Using a within-species heart transplantation model, we aimed to investigate the role of CD19 Our data suggest that adoptive transfer of the transplanted Bregs served as an effective tolerance-inducing mechanism in HT mice and was involved in the CD40-TRAF6 signaling pathway in DCs. Moreover, DCs collected from the Breg treated HT mice also prolonged the survival of HT mice. Furthermore, DC-specific knockout of TRAF6 diminished Breg-mediated prolongation of survival in HT mice. Interestingly, gut microbes from donors increased the survival of cardiac allografts both in both the absence and presence of Bregs but were not implicated in CD40-TRAF6 signaling. These findings reveal a role of Breg cells in the induction of transplantation tolerance through the blockade of the CD40-TRAF6 signaling pathway, which might be used in the treatment of HT in the clinic.
