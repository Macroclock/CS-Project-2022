The prognostic significance of restrictive diastolic filling associated with heart failure: a meta-analysis. Several studies have reported that the presence of a restrictive filling pattern (RFP) is associated with poor outcome in patients with heart failure (HF). These studies, of variable sample size, have involved different HF patient groups with variable associated mortality rates and follow-up times, and while powered for effects on combined end-points such as death or hospital admission, many were underpowered to reliably determine the overall effect of the RFP on total mortality. Consequently, we performed a meta-analysis to determine the mortality associated with RFP in patients with HF. We searched several online medical databases for prospective studies of patients with HF. All authors were requested to confirm their data. All-cause mortality was compared between RFP and non-restrictive filling patterns (Non-RFP). Review Manager version 4.2.7 software was used for the analysis. 3024 patients in 27 studies were identified (379 idiopathic cardiomyopathy, 2645 mixed aetiology HF). Average follow-up was between 3 months and 5 years. 1284 (42%) patients had RFP at baseline. 688 deaths occurred and the overall odds ratio for death was 4.36 (CI 3.60, 5.04); idiopathic group: 6.65 (CI 3.86, 11.47); mixed aetiology group: 4.10 (CI 3.34, 5.04). The overall odds ratio for death/transplantation was 4.87 (CI 4.04, 5.86); idiopathic group: 7.62 (CI 4.50, 12.92); mixed aetiology group: 4.56 (CI 3.74, 5.56). Restrictive filling pattern is associated with a four-fold increase in mortality in patients with HF and thus should be an important part of the echocardiographic assessment of such patients.
