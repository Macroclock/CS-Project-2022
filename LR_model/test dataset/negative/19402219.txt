Impact of ezetimibe on cholesterol  subfractions in dyslipidemic cardiac  transplant recipients receiving statin therapy. Ezetimibe decreases cholesterol in cardiac transplant recipients intolerant to statins therapy. The effects of ezetimibe in addition to statins therapy and its relationship with the magnitude of dyslipidemia and statins utilization have not been studied in cardiac transplant recipients. The design of this investigation was a retrospective case control study. Twenty-two patients receiving the combination of therapy of statins plus ezetimibe were compared with 43 patients treated with statins only. The endpoints were assessed after three months of follow-up. The addition of ezetimibe decreased low density lipoprotein-cholesterol by 25% compared with a 4% increase in patients receiving statins only. The impact of ezetimibe was similar regardless of the magnitude of dyslipidemia or statins dosage. Ezetimibe increase high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol only in patients with baseline HDL-cholesterol above 1.3 mM/L (p < 0.05). There was an asymptomatic, but significant increase in creatinine kinase level [+31.4 +/- 8.1 (ezetimibe) vs. + 1.5 +/- 5.0 mM/L (placebo); p = 0.005]. Ezetimibe therapy provides a significant reduction in most cholesterol subfractions regardless of the magnitude of dyslipidemia and statins dosage.
