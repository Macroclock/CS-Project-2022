Long-term prognostic role of CA-125 in noncongestive patients undergoing a cardiac transplantation. To evaluate the possible relationship between high levels of CA-125 and long-term prognosis in chronic heart failure patients after they undergo a cardiac transplantation (CT). We retrospectively studied all patients who underwent a CT and had a previous determination of CA-125. Congestive patients and those whose survival was <1 year after CT were excluded. Of 55 patients, 23 had elevated CA-125 levels (>35 U/ml). After CT, survival was significantly inferior in this group (96.3 vs 81%, 84.9 vs 64%, 70.7 vs 32.9% at 2, 5 and 8 years, p = 0.014). CA-125 >35 U/ml was the only factor independently associated to long-term mortality (OR: 3.94; 95% CI: 1.2-12.82; p = 0.023). Noncongestive patients with high levels of CA-125 had inferior long-term survival after CT.
