[Therapeutic drug monitoring of mycophenolate mofetil, sirolimus and cyclosporine at C2]. The evolutions in treatments and clinical practices in organ transplantations led to modifications in the therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of immunosuppressive drugs. A focus is made regarding the C2 sampling of cyclosporin, as well as the TDM of mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus. A review of literature about the evolution of drug monitoring, technical methods and sampling strategies is described. Arguments in favour of TDM are thus a decrease in the frequency of both graft rejection and adverse drug reactions, however, new strategies or new targets are needed in new associations or indications.
