Utility of temporal profiles of new cardio-renal and pulmonary candidate biomarkers in chronic heart failure. Our aim was to explore potential use of temporal profiles of seven emerging cardio-renal and two pulmonary candidate biomarkers for predicting future adverse clinical outcome in stable patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). In 263 CHF patients, we determined the risk of a composite endpoint of HF-hospitalization, cardiac death, LVAD-placement and heart transplantation in relation to repeatedly assessed (567 samples in total) blood biomarker levels, and slopes of their temporal trajectories (i.e., rate of biomarker change per year). In each patient, we estimated biomarker trajectories using repeatedly measured osteopontin (OPN), osteoprotegerin (OPG), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), heparin-binding protein (HBP), trefoil factor-3 (TFF3), kallikrein-6 (KLK-6), matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE), pulmonary surfactant-associated protein-D (PSP-D), and secretoglobulin family 3A-member-2 (SCGB3A2). During 2.2â€¯years of follow-up, OPN, OPG, and HBP levels predicted the composite endpoint (univariable hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] per 1SD increase: 2.31 [1.76-3.15], 2.23 [1.69-3.00], and 1.36[1.09-1.70]). Independently of the biomarkers' levels, the slopes of OPG, TFF-3, PSP-D trajectories were also strong clinical predictors (per 0.1SD increase: 1.24 [1.14-1.38], 1.31 [1.17-1.49], and 1.32 [1.21-1.47]). All associations persisted after multivariable adjustment for baseline characteristics, and repeatedly assessed CHF pharmacological treatment and cardiac biomarkers NT-proBNP and troponin T. Repeatedly-measured levels of OPN, OPG, and HBP, and slopes of OPG, TFF-3, and PSP-D strongly predict clinical outcome. These candidate biomarkers may be clinically relevant as they could further define a patient's risk and provide additional pathophysiological insights into CHF.
