No association between transforming growth factor beta gene polymorphism and acute allograft rejection after cardiac transplantation. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a multifunctional cytokine, which inhibits both development of Th1 and Th2 subsets and the Th1 proinflammatory response. TGF-beta1 production is influenced through several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the structural gene and promoter region. Acute rejection of transplants depends on the Th1/Th2 balance within the graft, high levels of TGF-beta1 shift this balance towards Th2. We investigated whether genotypes of 4 SNP (-800 and -509 in the promoter region, codon 10 and codon 25 in the first exon) were correlated with cardiac disease or with incidence of rejection after heart transplantation (HTX). Genotypes were determined for 70 HTX patients and 61 donors by sequencing or oligonucleotide ligation assay. No association between SNP genotypes and heart disease or acute transplant rejection was observed. We conclude that genetic variation in the TGF-beta1 gene neither influences the existence of cardiomyopathy nor the incidence of rejection upon HTX.
