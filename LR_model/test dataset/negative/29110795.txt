Anesthetic management of the patient with extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support. The use of short-term mechanical circulatory support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adult patients has increased over the last decade. Cardiothoracic anesthesiologists may care for these patients during ECMO placement and for procedures while ECMO support is in place. An understanding of ECMO capabilities, indications, and complications is essential to the anesthesiologist caring for these patients. Below we review the anesthetic considerations for the implantation of ECMO and concerns when caring for patients on ECMO.
