Combined heart-kidney transplantation: a review of recipient selection and patient outcomes. Elevated serum creatinine is a common finding among patients awaiting heart transplantation because of reduced renal perfusion in the setting of severe heart failure as well as overlapping risk factors for chronic kidney disease and heart disease. Patients with significant renal dysfunction preoperatively have worse outcomes with heart transplantation alone compared with those with normal renal function or those with renal dysfunction who undergo combined heart-kidney transplantation. Optimizing organ distribution and patient outcomes after cardiac transplantation requires appropriate recipient selection, including deciding which patients will benefit from combined heart-kidney transplantation. This review focuses on the evaluation of patients with chronic kidney disease awaiting heart transplantation and the outcomes of combined heart-kidney transplantation.
