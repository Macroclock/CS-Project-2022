Histocompatible miniature swine: an inbred large-animal model. Three herds of miniature swine, each homozygous for a different set of alleles at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and five intra-MHC recombinant strains, have been reported by the authors' laboratory. One herd (SLAdd) was selected for further inbreeding to achieve a histocompatible line. It has undergone seven additional generations of sequential brother-sister or father-daughter matings (termed G7). To determine the level of histocompatibility of these animals, the authors performed skin and heart transplantation without immunosuppression. In contrast to MHC-matched, minor antigen-mismatched animals that rejected skin in 11 days (median survival time [MST], n=6) and hearts in 35 days (MST, n=4), G7 animals accepted skin for greater than 340 days (>340, >448, and >677 days) and hearts for greater than 265 days (>265 and >269 days). Nevertheless, rejection of second grafts could be induced by sensitization, indicating that weak minor antigens remain, requiring further inbreeding to achieve full histocompatibility. We conclude that G7 animals are sufficiently inbred to accept first set skin and heart grafts indefinitely.
