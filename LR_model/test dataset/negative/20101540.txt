Clinical experience with the VentrAssist left ventricular assist device. Left ventricular mechanical assist device (LVAD) support is well established as a bridge to transplantation and as an alternative to transplantation in patients with end-stage heart failure. There are currently various LVAD systems available based on different types of pump technology. We present the VentrAssist LVAD, a centrifugal pump, and focus on a surgical implantation technique that may help reduce the complications typically associated with VAD surgery. 412 patients underwent VentrAssist LVAD implantation between June 2003 and January 2009 worldwide. The overall rate of success was 81 % (i.e., ongoing, HTX, or recovery). Interestingly hemolysis is greatly reduced with this intracorporeal centrifugal LVAD compared to other VAD systems with other pump designs. Our surgical implantation technique and strategy may contribute to reducing complications. The VentrAssist is a powerful and effective LVAD; its use can considerably reduce hemolysis. Long-term follow-up is necessary to determine whether the VentrAssist is appropriate as a bridge to transplant as well as feasible for long-term application.
