The relationship between depressive symptoms and anxiety and quality of life and functional capacity in heart transplant patients. To establish the relationship between depressive symptoms and anxiety with both the quality of life and functional capacity of heart transplant patients. Thirty-four patients were included. Outcome measures were the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the State- Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Short Form 36 (SF36) and peak oxygen consumption (pVO2). After the transplant there was a significant negative correlation between the BDI and most of subgroups on the SF36 (p<0.05). There were significant negative correlations found between the pVO2 and both the BDI and STAI-trait anxiety score (p<0.05). Statistically significant improvements were noted in all subgroups on the SF36 and all BDI scores after the transplant, in comparison to the pre-transplant period (p<0.05). The functional capacity of a person affects the state of their depression and anxiety. We recommend participation in a cardiac rehabilitation program in the early stages of transplantation and believe that the quality of life, which has been shown to be related to the functional capacity and psychological symptoms, would benefit from this program.
