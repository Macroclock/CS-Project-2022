[Angina after a heart transplant with evidence of late sympathetic reinnervation. Report of one case]. We report a 56 years-old man presenting with chest pain with exercise, seven years after an orthotopic heart transplant. A coronary angiography showed an atherosclerotic lesion in the common left main coronary artery with more than 90% obstruction. The lesion was successfully treated with a transluminal angioplasty with stenting. A 131-1 metaiodobenylguanidine (MIBG) scan demonstrated sympathetic reinnervation. Sixteen months later, due to progression of allograft vasculopathy, coronary artery bypass was required.
