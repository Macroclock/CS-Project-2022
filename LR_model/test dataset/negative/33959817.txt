Ethical and practical dilemmas in cardiac transplantation in infants: a literature review. The waiting time in infants for a cardiac transplant remains high, due to the scarcity of donors. Consequently, waiting list morbidity and mortality are higher than those in other age groups. Therefore, the decision to list a small infant for cardiac transplantation is seen as an ethical dilemma by most physicians. This review aims to describe outcomes, limitations, and ethical considerations in infant heart transplantation. We used Medline and Embase as data sources. We searched for publications on infant (< 1 year) heart transplantation, bridge-to-transplant and long-term outcomes, and waiting list characteristics from January 2009 to March 2021. Outcome after cardiac transplant in infants is better than that in older children (1-year survival 88%), and complications are less frequent (25% CAV, 10% PTLD). The bridge-to-transplant period in infants is associated with increased mortality (32%) and decreased transplantation rate (43%). This is mainly due to MCS complications or the limited MCS options (with 51% mortality in infancy). Outcomes are worse for infants with CHD or in need of ECMO-support.Conclusion: Infants listed for cardiac transplantation have a high morbidity and mortality, especially in the period between diagnosis and transplantation. For those who receive cardiac transplant, the outlook is encouraging. Unfortunately, despite growing experience in VAD, mortality in children < 10 kg and children with CHD remains high. After transplantation, patients carry a psychological burden and there is a probability of re-transplantation later in life, with decreased outcomes compared to primary transplantation. These considerations are seen as an important ethical dilemma in many centers, when considering cardiac transplantation in infants (< 1 year). What is Known: • For infants, waitlist mortality remains high. In the pediatric population, MCS reduces the waiting list mortality. What is New: • Outcomes after infant cardiac transplantation are better than other age groups; however, MCS options remain limited, with persistently high waiting list mortality. • Future developments in MCS and alternative options to reduce waiting list mortality such as ABO-incompatible transplantation and pulmonary artery banding are encouraging and will improve ethical decision-making when an infant is in need of a cardiac transplant.
