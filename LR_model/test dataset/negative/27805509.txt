Decompression of Left Ventricle During Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support as a Step to Transplant. Left ventricular distention can be recognized during the use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a key complication. Left ventricular decompression may decrease pulmonary pressure, minimize ventricular distention, and allow myocardial recovery. We applied venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to 4 patients while on a wait list for cardiac transplant. Two patients with severe heart failure developed high end-diastolic pressures leading to left ventricular distention. We used atrial venting methods to decrease the pressure. Here, we discussed the strategies to manage ventricular distention by conservative, interventional, and surgical means.
