Developments in mechanical support as a bridge to cardiac transplant. With the increasing incidence of congestive heart failure and limited numbers of donor hearts for transplantation, mechanical circulatory support devices are being used with greater frequency in Canada. The indications for device use, types of available pumps and centres performing these procedures are presented. A review of the results of use of these devices in Canada indicates that they may be a reasonable alternative for patients who might otherwise die without intervention. The cost implications of more widespread use of these pumps are not insignificant and must be compared with other life-saving technologies.
