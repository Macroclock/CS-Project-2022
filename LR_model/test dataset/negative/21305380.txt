[Heart transplantation. Pathology, clinical work-up and therapy]. Since the first heart transplantation in 1967, the procedure has become an established therapy in the treatment of terminal heart failure. Constant advances in the development of potent immunosuppressive drugs, as well as greater clinical experience and pathological diagnostics have improved patient survival dramatically. The first grading system for rejection was published in 1990 by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) and revised in 2004. The 2004 grading system comprises three grades of severity (1R, 2R, 3R), whereby the former grade 2 in the 1990 system has been incorporated in the new grade 1R. Recommendations are made for the histological diagnosis of acute antibody-mediated rejection using immunohistochemical staining against C4d and macrophages. To the present day, the pathological examination of endomyocardial biopsies remains the gold standard for post-transplant diagnostic procedures. Whether or not non-invasive diagnostic approaches (e.g. gene array profile analysis on leukocytes) can replace morphological investigations needs to be clarified in randomised, prospective clinical studies.
