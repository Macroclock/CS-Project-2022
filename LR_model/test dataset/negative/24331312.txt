Indication for transplantation in a patient with univentricular heart. Surgical correction of the univentrivular heart is an achievement of the last 4-5 decades. The Fontan pathway is nowadays an established but continuously improving surgical technique.Nevertheless, attrition of the univentricular heart is a well known process, its timing depending on several factors:technique, time of operation, type of ventricle aso. The study group is represented by 39 patients with univentricular circulation, operated (37 partial-PCPC and 2 total - TCPC cavo-pulmonary anastomosis) in our clinic between 2006 -2012. Out of this group, 2 patients have reached the stage of indication for heart transplantation: 1 has already been transplanted and one is listed for transplantation. The indication was in both a failing ventricle of left-type univentricular heart,in a PCPC status, performed after 14 years of age. Evolution in the transplanted patient is good. In conclusion, the option of heart transplantation should be available and kept in mind for the operated univentricular heart even at pediatric ages, as local peculiarities cause these hearts to fail even earlier than described in the literature.
