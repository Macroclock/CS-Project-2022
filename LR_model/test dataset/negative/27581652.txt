Neurodevelopmental functioning in children being evaluated for heart transplant prior to 2 years of age. Cardiac defects represent the most common type of birth defect and children with these abnormalities are known to experience a variety of developmental and neuropsychological delays. Children receiving heart transplants may be at the highest risk for delays as they tend to represent the most severely ill patients with heart disease. This study investigates neurocognitive and adaptive functioning in 20 children under 2 years of age who were undergoing evaluation for heart transplant, comparing their performance to that of normative samples. The results indicate delays across various domains of neurocognition, including general cognitive, receptive language, expressive language, fine motor, and gross motor skills. In addition, adaptive and social-emotional functioning fell significantly below that of normative samples. No significant differences were found when comparing the test performance of patients with congenital heart defects (n = 12) to patients with cardiomyopathy (n = 8). Secondary analyses investigating the impact of genetic conditions, premature birth, and non-English language dominance showed minor changes in results across some domains, although this may have been due, at least in part, to decreased power to detect differences. Overall, this study's results support the need for early evaluation, intensive intervention (e.g., speech, occupational, and physical therapy), and continued monitoring of these patients' neurodevelopmental/neuropsychological functioning over time. Future research should examine longitudinal changes in development using both pre- and post-transplant data and should investigate the impact of early intervention.
