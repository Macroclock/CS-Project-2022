Quality of life in bridge-to-transplant patients with chronic heart failure after implantation of an axial flow ventricular assist device. Research suggests that ventricular assist devices improve quality of life for congestive heart failure patients awaiting heart transplantation. Axial flow ventricular assist devices like the Jarvik 2000 (Jarvik Heart, Inc., New York, NY) represent the newest type of ventricular assist device technology, but their effects on quality of life are not well understood. Therefore, the authors administered the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire to patients who had the Jarvik 2000 implanted as a bridge to heart transplantation. Patients completed the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire immediately before device implantation, 1 month after implantation, immediately before heart transplantation, and 1 month after transplantation. One month after implantation of the device, the nine patients who completed the study showed significant improvements in physical (p<0.008), emotional (p<0.02), and overall (p<0.008) quality of life. These improvements were maintained until the device was explanted. The authors conclude that implantation of the Jarvik 2000 ventricular assist device can substantially improve quality of life for patients awaiting heart transplantation.
