Short-term ventricular assist device as a bridge to decision in cardiogenic shock: is it a justified strategy? Low cardiac output syndrome is associated with significant mortality. In patients with refractory low cardiac output left ventricular assist devices (VAD) are used to re-establish cardiac output and to prevent death. However, long-term LVAD implantation in these is complicated by a high rate of right heart failure and mortality. Therefore, our strategy is to implant a short-term VAD (left or biventricular) as a bridge to decission. We retrospectively analysed data from 66 patients who received a short-term LVAD support prior to implantation of a long-term LVAD or HTx between 2003 and 2014. We performed short-term LVAD (CentriMag; Thoratec) implantation via median sternotomy with percutaneous cannulas. Patients were included regardless of perioperative status and severity of heart failure. Patients suffering postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock, receiving isolated RVAD as well as posttransplant patients were excluded from this study. Mean duration of support in the survivor group was 35 ± 25 days versus 25 ± 25 days in the nonsurvivor group (n.s.), range from 1 to 109 days. The overall survival on support was 40 (60%) patients. In the survivor group 12 patients could be successfully weaned from the system, 12 patients received a heart transplant and in 16 a long-term VAD was implanted. In the nonsurvivor group the rate of preoperative extracorporeal life support, the rate of postoperative renal failure and multiorgan failure was significantly higher. Thanks to its capacity for full ventricular support, short-term univentricular or biventricular LevotronixCentriMag VAD currently represents an ideal solution for bridge-to-decision.
