Sudden cardiac death associates with a large right atrium thrombus in a late survivor of heart transplantation. A fatal circulatory collapse developed acutely in a patient six years after orthotopic heart transplantation. Autopsy revealed a large, fresh thrombus inside the right atrium which obstructed the orifice of the vena cava completely. The grafted coronary artery and pulmonary vessels were patent. There was no rejection or acute infarct in myocardium. Mildly immature organization was seen on the thrombus-adhered wall. Four chamber enlargement and a rapid decline of right ventricular hypokinesia were detected shortly before death although he did not show active cardiopulmonary symptom. Intracardiac thrombus formation is rather uncommon in late survivor. A synergic effect of atrial turbulence and ventricular hypokinesia in the right heart, superimposed by tissue organization, was proposed for thrombus formation. An empty cardiac output was favored for his mortality. These findings provide a strong evidence to suggest anticoagulation in case of complicated or highly risk of embolization such as turbulence or hypokinesia despite of an absence of active cardiopulmonary symptom.
