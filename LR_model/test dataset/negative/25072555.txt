Robotic-assisted implantation of ventricular assist device after sternectomy and pectoralis muscle flap. Left ventricular assist devices are increasingly important in the management of advanced heart failure. Most patients who benefit from these devices have had some prior cardiac surgery, making implantation of higher risk. This is especially true in patients who have had prior pectoralis flap reconstruction after sternectomy for mediastinitis. We outline the course of such a patient, in whom the use of robotic assistance allowed for a less invasive device implantation approach with preservation of the flap for transplantation.
