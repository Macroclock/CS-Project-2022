Predictors of long-term renal function after conversion to proliferation signal inhibitors in long-term heart transplant recipients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the change in renal function and its determinants after replacement of calcineurin inhibitors with a proliferation signal inhibitor (sirolimus or everolimus) in long-term heart transplant recipients. We studied 49 consecutive patients in whom a switch to a proliferation signal inhibitor was carried out 9 ± 4 years after transplantation. Evolutive glomerular filtration rate was assessed at a mean of 28 months after conversion by the simplified MDRD equation. Pre-conversion glomerular filtration rate (40 ± 22 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) remained stable at 1 year after conversion (41 ± 22 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), but decreased significantly by the end of follow-up (35 ± 22 ml/min/1.73 m(2); p = 0.008 and p = 0.002 vs pre-conversion and 1-year values, respectively). In a multivariate model, including age, time from transplantation to conversion, pre-conversion glomerular filtration rate, presence of diabetes and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB) therapy, the rate of decline in renal function was related only to the presence of diabetes (p = 0.017) and inversely related to the use of ACEI/ARB therapy (p = 0.003). There were no significant differences with respect to age, time between transplantation and replacement and baseline glomerular filtration rate. In long-term heart transplant recipients, late substitution of a calcineurin inhibitor for a proliferation signal inhibitor does not preclude a decrease in renal function in the long-term setting. We identified the presence of diabetes as the main clinical predictor of renal function deterioration. In contrast, we found that the use of ACEI/ARB therapy could exert a protective effect.
