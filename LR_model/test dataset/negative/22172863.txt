Noninvasive diagnosis of cardiac allograft rejection using echocardiography indices of systolic and diastolic function. Limited and conflicting data exist on the diagnosis of cardiac allograft rejection with the use of echocardiography. The purpose of our study was to evaluate various systolic and diastolic indices, including newer tissue Doppler imaging techniques, in diagnosing cardiac allograft rejection. We prospectively performed 426 echocardiography studies at the time of endomyocardial biopsy in 54 cardiac transplant patients. We measured left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic dimensions, mitral inflow pattern and annular velocities, and the myocardial performance index. Biopsies were assessed for cellular rejection and antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). Mild cellular rejection was diagnosed in 74 biopsy specimens and significant cellular rejection in 10 biopsy specimens. AMR was diagnosed in 30 biopsy specimens. In patients with mild or significant cellular rejection, no significant differences in echocardiographic parameters were observed. In patients with AMR, LV fractional shortening was significantly reduced compared with those with no AMR (mean±SD 31.8±8.9% vs 36.0±7.1%; P=.02). Although 1 echocardiographic parameter was statistically different in the setting of rejection, lack of consistency and overlap between nonrejection and rejection groups does not permit definitive noninvasive diagnosis of cardiac allograft rejection using this imaging modality.
