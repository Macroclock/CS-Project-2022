Factors associated with low physical activity levels following pediatric cardiac transplantation. Objectively measured MVPA levels following pediatric cardiac transplantation are unknown despite physical health implications. We sought to determine factors associated with MVPA in a pediatric cohort who had undergone cardiac transplantation. Study assessments included maximal exercise testing (VO(2) max), accelerometry, and physical activity (HAES) and functional health status (CHQ-PF50) questionnaires. Participants (n = 20, 60% male, age: 11.8 ± 3.0 yr old) had a VO(2) max of 28.5 ± 6.8 mL/kg/min (%-predicted: 65 ± 14%) and maximal heart rate of 154 ± 16 beats/min (%-predicted: 73 ± 7.5%). Participants performed a median of 7.6 min/day (Q1 4.0 min/day, Q3 11.0 min/day) of MVPA. Each additional year of age at transplantation was associated with a decrease of 1.9 [1.0] min/day of MVPA (p = 0.07). Predicted VO(2) max, maximal power output, male sex, and age at study enrollment were not associated with an increase in MVPA. Parents' perception of their child's functional health status (CHQ-PF50) was lower on general health (p < 0.01) and family activity (p < 0.01) domains relative to a population-based cohort of parents reporting on healthy children. Pediatric cardiac transplantation recipients may be indicated to participate in cardiac rehabilitation to optimize physical activity levels.
