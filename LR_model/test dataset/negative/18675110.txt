Emergency use of wearable left ventricular assist devices in patients not eligible for heart transplantation. We reviewed our experience concerning the clinical outcomes of emergency implantation of left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) in patients not eligible for heart transplantation (HTX). Between January 1998 and September 2006, 62 patients were referred for emergency HTX including 35 (55%) who received cardiac allografts; 9 (14%) died on the waiting list. The other 18 subjects (31%) did not meet listing criteria due to pulmonary hypertension with massive transpulmonary gradients (TPG), severe diabetes, or another factor; 7 patients had wearable LVAD implants and the remaining 11 who had contraindications both to HTX and to LVAD implantation remained on medical therapy. Twelve month actuarial survivals were 47% in LVAD G1 vs 1% in medical therapy G2 (P< .005). Four G1 patients died either due to cerebrovascular vascular episodes or to thromboembolic events. The beneficial use of LVAD in 3 patients led to consistent improvement in hemodynamic performance allowing listing for HTX. Two of them have been successfully transplanted; 1 is still waiting. Due to refractory heart failure, 90% of G2 died within the first months after evaluation. Our limited experience indicated that emergency use of LVAD ensued a satisfactory outcome allowing better actuarial survival.
