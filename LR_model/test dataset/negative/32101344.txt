Differential effects of heat-inactivated, secretome-deficient MSC and metabolically active MSC in sepsis and allogenic heart transplantation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are used in various clinical and preclinical models for immunomodulation. However, it remains unclear how the immunomodulatory effect of MSC is communicated. MSC-induced immunomodulation is known to be mediated through both MSC-secreted cytokines and direct cell-cell interactions. Recently, it has been demonstrated that metabolically inactive, heat-inactivated MSCs (HI-MSCs) have similar anti-inflammatory capacities in LPS-induced sepsis compared with viable MSC. To further investigate the immunomodulatory effects of MSC, we introduced MSC and HI-MSC in two animal models with different immunological causes. In the first model, allogeneic hearts were transplanted from C57BL/6 mice to BALB/c recipients. MSC in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) significantly improved graft survival compared with MMF alone, whereas the application of HI-MSC had no effect on graft survival. We revealed that control MSC dose-dependently inhibited CD3 'T cells', 'heat-inactivated mesenchymal stem cells', 'immunomodulation', 'mesenchymal stem cells', 'monocytes', 'organ transplantation', 'sepsis'
