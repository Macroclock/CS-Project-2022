Orthotopic Heart Transplantation in a Child with Single Ventricle after Pneumonectomy. We report a 6-year-old with single ventricle physiology secondary to tricuspid atresia who had cardiorespiratory failure who was not a candidate for further single ventricle palliation. The patient underwent planned staged left pneumonectomy for recurrent pneumonias secondary to bronchomalacia followed by orthotopic heart transplantation. This aggressive approach improved the patient candidacy for heart transplantation by removing the source of recurrent infection and respiratory failure (left lung).
