Short- and long-term outcomes after heart transplantation in cardiac sarcoidosis and giant-cell myocarditis: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Heart transplantation (HTx) is a valid therapeutic option for end-stage heart failure secondary to cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) or giant-cell myocarditis (GCM). However, post-HTx outcomes in patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy (ICM) have been poorly investigated. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Science Citation Index, EMBASE, and Google Scholar, screened the gray literature, and contacted experts in the field. We included studies comparing post-HTx survival, acute cellular rejection, and disease recurrence in patients with and without ICM. Data were synthesized by a random-effects meta-analysis. We screened 11,933 articles, of which 14 were considered eligible. In a pooled analysis, post-HTx survival was higher in CS than non-CS patients after 1Â year (risk ratio [RR] 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60-1.17; I 'Cardiac sarcoidosis', 'Giant-cell myocarditis', 'Heart transplantation', 'Inflammatory cardiomyopathy', 'Meta-analysis', 'Systematic review'
