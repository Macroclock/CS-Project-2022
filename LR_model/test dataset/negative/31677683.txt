New Techniques for Optimization of Donor Lungs/Hearts. Injuries sustained by donor heart and lung allografts during the transplantation process are multiple and cumulative. Optimization of allograft function plays an essential role in short- and long-term outcomes after transplantation. Therapeutic targets to prevent or attenuate injury are present in the donor, the preservation process, during transplantation, and in postoperative management of the recipient. The newest and most promising methods of optimizing donor heart and lung allografts are found in alternative preservation strategies, which enable functional assessment of donor organs and provide a modality to initiate therapies for injured allografts or prevent injury during reperfusion in recipients.
