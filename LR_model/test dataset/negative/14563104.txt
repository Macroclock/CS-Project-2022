Mental health issues associated with cardiovascular disease in women. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in women and men. However, cardiovascular disease and its treatment affect women differently. Much data is emerging regarding the role that mood and anxiety disorders play in the development and prognosis of cardiovascular disease. Pharmacologic treatment of psychiatric disorders can also have direct cardiac effects. The good news is that many more studies are exploring this. However, further research is clearly needed, especially in the area of reproductive hormones and their impact on cardiac disease.
