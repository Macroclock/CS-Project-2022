[Ophthalmologic findings in cardiac transplant recipients]. To evaluate findings of ophthalmologic examinations in cardiac transplant recipients, searching especially for changes in the retinal nerve fiber layer by means of Scanning Laser Polarimetry. Fifteen cardiac transplant recipients were examined from September 2003 to July 2004. All of them underwent ophthalmologic examination, which consisted of visual acuity (VA), biomicroscopy, tonometry and fundoscopy. Fiber layer analyzer-GDx-examination was performed in eleven patients. Twelve patients were men. The mean age was 55.0+/-13.5 years. The follow-up since transplantation lasted from 3 to 74 months; mean value 29.7+/-20.8 months. VA with best correction in all patients attained at least 20/40. Subcapsular posterior cataract was seen in one patient; another presented corneal nubeculae secondary to herpes zoster. In one case a scar suggesting retinocoroiditis was seen at fundoscopy. Biomicroscopic and the fundoscopic findings were expected because of immunosuppressive treatment, following transplantation. GDx examination disclosed loss of fibers in the superior retinal fiber layer in 12 of the 22 examined eyes. These results support the hypothesis that reduction of oxygen inflow in retinal circulation before or during heart transplantation could lead to loss of fibers in the retinal nerve fiber layer.
