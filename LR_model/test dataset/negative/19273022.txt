Ventricular intramyocardial electrograms and their expected potential for cardiac risk surveillance, telemonitoring, and therapy management. Ventricular intramyocardial electrograms are recorded with electrodes directly from the heart either in intraventricular or epimyocardial position and may be acquired either from the spontaneously beating or from the paced heart. The morphology of these signals differs significantly from that of body surface ECG recordings. Although the morphology shows general characteristics, it additionally depends on different individual impacts. This problem of individual evaluation is briefly discussed. As an appropriate methodology for its solution, personalized referencing based on similarity averaging has been employed. A more general approach may be model-based signal interpretation, which is still under investigation. The preliminary results reveal a promising potential of intramyocardial electrograms for cardiac risk surveillance, e.g., for arrhythmia detection, recognition of rejection events in transplanted hearts, and assessment of hemodynamic performance. Employing implants with telemetric capabilities may render possible permanent and even continuous cardiac telemonitoring. Furthermore, the signals can be utilized for supporting therapy management, e.g., in patients with different kinds of cardiomyopathies. This paper shall demonstrate some preliminary results and discuss the expected potential.
