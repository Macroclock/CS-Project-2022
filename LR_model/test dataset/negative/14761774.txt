Heart transplantation in a patient with chloroquine-induced cardiomyopathy. We present the first report of a patient who underwent heart transplantation (HT) after endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) and revealed chloroquine-induced cardiomyopathy (CIC). This patient, who was treated with chloroquine for 6 years, developed a restrictive cardiomyopathy that progressed to congestive heart failure (CHF) resistant to medical management.
