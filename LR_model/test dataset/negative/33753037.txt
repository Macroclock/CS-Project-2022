Malignant Ventricular Tachycardia, Ventricular Wall Ablation, and Orthotopic Heart Transplantation. Described herein are three patients with refractory ventricular tachycardia and one or more unsuccessful ablation procedures finally leading to orthotropic heart transplantation (OHT). The latter procedure allowed examination of the ventricular ablation sites, an unusual opportunity reported previously in few patients (all case reports). The acute ablation lesions are unique, with necrosis of the myocardial fibers adjacent to the endocardium and encircled by layers of extravasated erythrocytes in the deeper myocardial wall. All 3 patients returned to normal activities following the OHT.
