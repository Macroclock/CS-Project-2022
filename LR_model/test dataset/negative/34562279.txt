Better together: a reappraisal of heterotopic heart transplantation. Heterotopic heart transplantation (HHT) is rare in the modern era. When used as a biologic left ventricular assist, HHT provides pulsatile flow, supports the left ventricle with a physiologic cardiac output, responds to humoral stimuli, and with modern immunosuppression may offer long-term untethered survival. This study was undertaken to compare survival of HHT with orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) to assess its viability in the modern era. In the United Network for Organ Sharing database, from January 1999 to December 2020, there were 27691 bicaval OHT, 13836 biatrial OHT, 1271 total OHT, and 51 HHT with sufficient follow-up. Survival was analyzed using restricted mean survival time (RMST) through 4 years as the outcome. In the first 4 years after transplant, compared with HHT, differences in RMST were 0.1 years (99% CI: -0.4 to 0.5 years) for bicaval OHT, 0.0 years (99% CI: -0.4 to 0.5 years) for biatrial OHT, and 0.0 years (99% CI: -0.5 to 0.4 years) for total OHT. In this cohort, survival was indistinguishable between HHT and OHT recipients in the first four years. Thus, HHT might be a viable alternative to durable mechanical circulatory assist particularly with size mismatched grafts or for patients with refractory pulmonary hypertension.
