Clinical outcomes of pediatric ventricular assist device implantation: a single-institute report from Japan. Numerous difficulties remain associated with pediatric heart transplantation. Therefore, the development of a ventricular assist device (VAD) specific to these cases is extremely important for therapeutic effectiveness. We present 5 cases of severe heart failure that were managed by ventricular assist device implantation, as a bridge to transplantation. We examined the clinical course of 5 patients (4 boys, 1 girl; mean age, 10.6 ± 1.5 years; range, 8-12 years) who underwent implantation of a pneumatic extracorporeal ventricular assist device between February 2004 and May 2009. Four patients had dilated cardiomyopathy and one had corrected transposition of the great arteries. The mean period between onset of heart failure and ventricular assist device implantation was 594 ± 750 days (range, 94-1702 days), and the mean duration of ventricular assist support was 112 ± 98 days (range, 44-284 days). Four patients underwent heart transplantation overseas and one died of cerebral hemorrhage. Careful management of pediatric VAD patients and development of a device designed specifically for pediatric patients are essential for improving clinical outcomes in the future.
