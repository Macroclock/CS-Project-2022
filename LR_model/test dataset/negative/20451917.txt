Transfer of bone marrow progenitors prevents coronary insufficiency and systolic dysfunction in the mechanical unloaded heart in mice. Left ventricular-assist device (LVAD) can lead to improvement of cardiac performance in a subset of patients, but chronic mechanical unloading in this fashion may result in left ventricular (LV)-atrophy and impaired functional recovery. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of transferring bone-marrow KSL cells (Lin-/c-kit+/Sca1+), a fraction containing endothelial progenitor cells, for preventing LV-atrophy and malfunction in a mouse model of mechanical unloading of the heart. Recipients of an isogenic heart transplant received intramyocardial isogenic KSL cells or PBS in three different locations of the left ventricle (LV). Coronary blood flow and LV systolic function were evaluated by echocardiography, and morphologic changes were analyzed on d 7 and 56. PBS-treated mice showed severe systolic dysfunction and large thrombi in LV at both time points. In contrast, KSL cell transfer markedly reduced systolic dysfunction and thrombus size. Furthermore, in comparison with PBS control, KSL recipients had increased coronary blood flow (3-fold, P < 0.01) accompanied by increased LV capillary density and muscle mass. These results indicate that intramyocardial transfer of bone marrow KSL cells significantly protects against coronary insufficiency and systolic dysfunction in the chronic LV-unloading heart, suggesting that this approach may have clinical potential as a combination therapy with LVAD.
