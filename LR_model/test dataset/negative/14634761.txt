[Implantation of CardioWest total artificial heart in irreversible acute myocardial infarction shock-new hope for patients with infaust prognosis]. Patients in whom cardiogenic shock develops after acute myocardial infarction have a very high death rate despite early reperfusion therapy. Often hemodynamic stabilization can be achieved only by implantation of a mechanical circulatory support system. When pharmacological therapy and onset of percutaneous assist devices fails in cases representing expansive myocardial impairment without any chance of recovery, the indication for implanting a total artificial heart is given. We report on our first experiences with this extensive and innovative management of irreversible cardiogenic shock patients. In five patients (male, mean age 50 years) the CardioWest total artificial heart was implanted. All patients were in irreversible cardiogenic shock despite maximal dosages of catecholamines, intraaortic balloon pump and/or femorofemoral bypass. In all patients early reperfusion therapy was performed. After implantation of the CardioWest system, rapid recovery of all dysfunctional organ systems occurred in all patients. Four of five patients underwent successful heart transplantation after a mean support time of 156 days. One patient died because of enterocolic necroses caused by embolic event after termination of dicumarol therapy. In summary, first experiences justify this extensive management in these young patients who otherwise would have died within a few hours.
