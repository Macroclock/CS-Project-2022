The emerging role of multi-detector computed tomography in heart failure. Recent advances in cardiac multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) technology now permits entire coronary tree evaluation in a single breath hold with submillimeter slice collimation and improved temporal resolution. Besides excellent correlation with invasive angiogram for the detection of significant coronary occlusion, MDCT also provides reliable and reproducible data regarding various other cardiac anatomic and functional parameters that are pertinent to heart failure patients. These include left ventricular measurement (eg, ejection fraction, regional wall motion, dimensions, volumes), pulmonary vein anatomy and drainage, right ventricular function, and cardiac venous system, among many others. However, there are radiogenic and nonradiogenic risks associated with MDCT that should be considered before scanning the patients. This review summarizes the existing literature of the various cardiac MDCT applications pertinent to heart failure patients.
