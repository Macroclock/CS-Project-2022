Cytomegalovirus-Responsive CD8 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients. Approximately 60% of adults are CMV seropositive, indicating previous exposure. Following resolution of the primary infection, CMV remains in a latent state. Reactivation is controlled by memory T cells in healthy individuals; transplant recipients have reduced memory T cell function due to chronic immunosuppressive therapies.
