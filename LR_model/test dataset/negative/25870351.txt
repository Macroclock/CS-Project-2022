Repair of early posttransplant endomyocardial biopsy-related tricuspid regurgitation in a child. We describe surgical repair of symptomatic tricuspid valve regurgitation in the early posttransplant period in a small child. The tricuspid valve regurgitation was due to injury to the valve and chordal apparatus during surveillance endomyocardial biopsy. The described surgical technique produced durable improvement in valve function.  'biopsy (heart)', 'heart valve', 'pediatric', 'transplantation (heart)'
