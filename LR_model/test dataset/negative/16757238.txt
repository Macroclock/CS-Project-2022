Role of the pathologist in organ transplantation: the North Italy Transplant program experience. The North Italy Transplant program (NITp) is one of the three organ exchange organizations in Italy together with AIRT and OCST, supervised by the Centro Nazionale Trapianti. It started its activity on June 18, 1972 and serves an area of about 18 million inhabitants in northern Italy. From June 18, 1972 to December 31, 2004, 5761 cadaveric donors have been used and 18,390 transplants performed in the NITp. At December 31, 2004, the NITp waiting list included 3407 patients (2261 kidney, 425 heart, 387 liver, 153 pancreas, 181 lung). From January 1 to August 31, 2005, 13 donors with cancer were used, namely, 4.2% of the overall number of procured donors. The yearly projection of this figure is more than twofold above that in the previous year. Pathologists play a crucial role in NITp activity, by assessing donor suitability and organ quality, by performing the autopsy control of donors, and by participating in transplant follow-up. In addition the pathologist responsible for the Veneto-centralized pathology unit plays the role of expert for second opinion for the NITp area. Pathologists are involved in expanding the pool of donors by analyzing organ biopsies in specific programs. Eight HBV(+) and/or HCV(+) liver biopsies have been evaluated during 2003 and 18 during 2004 and 12 livers, according to the protocol, were suitable for transplantation, and 14 double kidney transplantations were performed in 2003 and 35 in 2004.
