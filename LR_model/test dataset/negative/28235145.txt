Cardiac transplantation in a neonate-First case in Switzerland and European overview. Twenty-four percent of pediatric heart transplantations (pHTx) are carried out in infants. Neonatal heart transplantation is both rarely performed and challenging. We report on a newborn baby girl suffering from cardiac failure due to a huge tumor (24×52 mm) within the free wall of the left ventricle (LV) and subtotal obstruction of the main left bronchus. Following a surgical tumor resection, a Berlin Heart EXCOR left ventricular assist device was implanted as the bridge to the transplantation. In spite of an organ donor/recipient mismatch of >200%, both heart transplantation and the postoperative course were successful. In addition to this case report, the authors also present data from a survey on performed infant and neonatal transplantations in Western Europe. As neonatal heart transplantation is a rare event in Europe, the authors think it is of crucial importance to share this limited experience. We discuss an alternative strategy-namely, palliative surgical correction using the Fontan pathway. The challenges of donor/recipient weight mismatch and the possibilities of overcoming infant donor organ shortage as a postoperative immunosuppressive regimen are discussed as well.
