Cardiothoracic surgery after heart and heart-lung transplantation. We sought to examine our management and the outcomes of cardiothoracic procedures after heart and heart lung transplantation. We performed a retrospective review of cardiothoracic surgical procedures carried out between 1990 and 2004 in patients who had previously undergone heart or heart-lung transplantation at our institution. Twenty-one out of 340 patients (6.2 %) were identified. Cardiothoracic surgery was performed 44.4 +/- 33 months (range 1 - 115 months) after transplantation. Predominant types of surgery were coronary artery bypass grafting due to allograft vasculopathy (n = 5), aortic surgery due to acute dissection (n = 3), biventricular assist device implantation due to acute rejection (n = 1), tricuspid valve repair (n = 1), multiple cardiac surgical procedures including coronary artery bypass grafting, retransplantation, and tricuspid valve replacement (n = 2), explantation of a functionless heterotopic transplanted heart (n = 1). Lung surgery was performed in six patients due to pneumonia (n = 2), primary lung carcinoma (n = 3), lung torsion following heart-lung transplantation (n = 1). All patients underwent either lobectomy or segmental lung resection. Single lung retransplantation (n = 2) after prior heart-lung transplantation due to bronchiolitis obliterans was performed. In one patient a pneumonectomy (n = 1) due to severe chronic rejection of the contralateral lung was performed. Six subsequent deaths after cardiothoracic procedures were recorded after 1, 4, 78, 163, 205, and 730 days, respectively. Causes of death were advanced carcinoma (n = 1), multi-organ failure due to sepsis (n = 2), sudden heart death (n = 2), and advanced heart failure (n = 1). Fifteen out of 21 patients having undergone cardiothoracic procedures (71.4 %) survived the observation period of 56.6 +/- 34 months (range 1 - 114). Reasons for cardiothoracic procedures after prior heart or heart-lung transplantation were allograft vasculopathy, aortic dissections years after transplantation, chronic rejection, and either lung infections or malignancies. Surgical repair can be performed with an acceptable operative risk and good long-term survival rates.
