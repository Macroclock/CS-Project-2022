Heart transplantation in 7 patients from a single family with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy caused by lamin A/C mutation. We describe 7 transplanted heart recipients from a single family with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B linked to a mutation of the LMNA gene in the splice donor site of the exon 9 (IVS 9+1:g>a). These patients did not display higher early postoperative or late complications than other heart transplant recipients at a mean follow-up of 8 years (range 1-17 years). Noticeably, there was no case of rhabdomyolysis and skeletal muscle symptoms were not markedly impaired.
