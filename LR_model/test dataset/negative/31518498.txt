Nanodelivery of Mycophenolate Mofetil to the Organ Improves Transplant Vasculopathy. Inflammation occurring within the transplanted organ from the time of harvest is an important stimulus of early alloimmune reactivity and promotes chronic allograft rejection. Chronic immune-mediated injury remains the primary obstacle to the long-term success of organ transplantation. However, organ transplantation represents a rare clinical setting in which the organ is accessible  'chronic rejection', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'nanodelivery', 'selective drug delivery', 'transplant'
