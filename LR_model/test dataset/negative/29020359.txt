Sofosbuvir-based Interferon-Free Direct Acting Antiviral Regimens for Heart Transplant Recipients With Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection. We assessed the effectiveness and safety of sofosbuvir (SOF) combined with ledipasvir (LDV) or daclatasvir (DCV) in 12 heart transplant recipients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). The sustained virologic response (SVR12) rate was 100% [95% confidence interval [CI]: 75.8%-100%]. All patients tolerated treatment well without interruption, death, or serious adverse events.
