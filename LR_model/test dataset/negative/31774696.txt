The implementation of physiological afterload during ex situ heart perfusion augments prediction of posttransplant function. Ex situ heart perfusion (ex situ heart perfusion) is an emerging technique that aims to increase the number of organs available for transplantation by augmenting both donor heart preservation and evaluation. Traditionally, ex situ heart perfusion has been performed in an unloaded Langendorff mode, though more recently groups have begun to use pump-supported working mode (PSWM) and passive afterload working mode (PAWM) to enable contractile evaluation during ex situ heart perfusion. To this point, however, neither the predictive effectiveness of the two working modes nor the predictive power of individual contractile parameters has been analyzed. In this article, we use our previously described system to analyze the predictive relevance of a multitude of contractile parameters measured in each working mode. Ten porcine hearts were excised and perfused ex situ in Langendorff mode for 4 h, evaluated using pressure-volume catheterization in both PSWM and PAWM, and transplanted into size-matched recipient pigs. After 3 h, hearts were weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass and evaluated. When correlating posttransplant measurements to their ex situ counterparts, we report that parameters measured in both modes show sufficient power (Spearman rank coefficient > 0.7) in predicting global posttransplant function, characterized by cardiac index and preload recruitable stroke work. For the prediction of specific posttransplant systolic and diastolic function, however, a large discrepancy between the two working modes was observed. With 9 of 10 measured posttransplant parameters showing stronger correlation with counterparts measured in PAWM, it is concluded that PAWM allows for a more detailed and nuanced prediction of posttransplant function than can be made in PSWM.
