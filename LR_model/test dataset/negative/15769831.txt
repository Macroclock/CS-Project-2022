Role of inhaled nitric oxide in adult heart or lung transplant recipients. To evaluate the role of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in adult heart or lung transplant recipients. Pertinent literature was identified via a MEDLINE search (1966-July 2004). Pulmonary hypertension leading to right ventricular failure and ischemic reperfusion injury are complications following heart or lung transplant, respectively. A study of 16 heart transplant patients showed improvement in hemodynamic parameters and preservation of right ventricular function, but no improvement in mortality using iNO. Studies of lung transplant patients showed no benefit of iNO on mechanical ventilation duration, hospital length of stay, or mortality, but some studies indicate an improvement in hemodynamic parameters. iNO shows hemodynamic benefits in early postoperative heart transplant patients with preexisting pulmonary hypertension, and variable hemodynamic benefits in lung transplant recipients. Currently, morbidity and mortality data are not favorable for either indication; use of iNO is supportive and requires further study.
