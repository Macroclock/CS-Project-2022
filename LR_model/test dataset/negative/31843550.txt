Delivery of FK506-loaded PLGA nanoparticles prolongs cardiac allograft survival. In this study, FK506-loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles (PLGA-FK506-NPs) were developed using an O/W emulsion solvent evaporation method. The PLGA-FK506-NPs were observed to be monodispersed and spherical by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The mean size and zeta potential measured by dynamic light scattering were 110 ± 1.3 nm and -20.56 ± 3.65 mV, respectively. The FK506 entrapment and loading efficiency were 94.46 ± 1.88% and 5.38 ± 0.24%, respectively. Moreover, a pharmacokinetics study revealed that the PLGA-FK506-NPs behaved significantly different than free FK506 by exhibiting a higher area under curve (1.69-fold), higher mean residence time (1.29-fold), slower clearance and longer elimination half-life. Notably, the concentrations of FK506 in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes of the PLGA-FK506-NP group were 3.1-fold and 2.9-fold higher than those of the free FK506 group. Furthermore, the immunosuppressive efficacy was evaluated in a rat heterotopic heart transplantation model, and the results showed that PLGA-FK506-NP treatment could successfully alleviate acute rejection and prolong allograft survival compared with the free FK506 treatment (mean survival time, 17.1 ± 2.0 versus 13.3 ± 1.7 days). In conclusion, PLGA-FK506-NPs are a promising formulation for spleen and lymph node delivery and have potential use in the treatment of cardiac allograft acute rejection.
