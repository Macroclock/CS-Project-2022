Extracorporeal photochemotherapy in heart transplant rejection: A single-center experience. The addition of extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP) to standard immunosuppressive therapy has been suggested to be beneficial in the treatment of recurrent/persistent heart rejection. We reviewed medical data of heart transplant recipients who received ECP between 2010 and 2016 at our institution. During the study period, eight patients underwent nine ECP courses. The median time from transplant to ECP was 18 months (range 9-54). Indications for ECP were recurrent rejection in 6 patients, persistent rejection in 1 patient and mixed rejection with hemodynamic compromise in 1 patient. Additional criteria for patients' selection were represented by relevant comorbidities limiting the increase of immunosuppressive therapies. ECP was performed on an outpatient basis in 6 out of 8 patients. The median ECP duration was 12 months (range 1-18). Three out of 8 patients responded to ECP showing negative endomyocardial biopsies at the end of treatment. No additional rejection episodes were observed at their follow up (at 44, 72 and 31 months). Four of 8 patients failed to respond to ECP treatment, one patient has been judged not evaluable. Reduction of immunosuppressive therapies was obtained in all 3 responsive patients but also in 3 patients with a stable grade of rejection. The median duration of the follow up was 26 months (range 6-80). Two patients died at 6 and 21 months after beginning ECP. Survival after ECP was 78.2% at 26 months. No adverse effect or infectious complications associated with ECP were reported. The low response rate (37.5%) in our case series could be partially explained by patient selection, the treated patients representing a high-risk sub-set group. Further studies to provide evidence of a role for ECP in heart rejection treatment or prophylaxis are needed. 'ECP', 'Extracorporeal photochemotherapy', 'Heart rejection', 'Heart transplantation'
