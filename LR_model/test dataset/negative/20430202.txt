Pediatric heart transplantation bridged with ventricular assist devices. Heart transplantation (HTx) is indicated in children with end-stage heart failure or complex inoperable congenital defects. Because of the shortage of pediatric donor hearts, various bridge techniques have been used in pediatric patients to prolong patient survival until a suitable heart becomes available. We reviewed medical records of several pediatric patients in whom bridging with ventricular assist devices was used. All of the patients survived HTx, and are alive and well with no neurologic sequelae. They are NYHA functional class I. Thus, morbidity and mortality were acceptable in this high-risk group of pediatric patients with a ventricular assist device bridging to HTx.
