Low Cardiac Output After Orthotopic Heart Transplant Secondary to Large Inferior Vena Cava Thrombus After Prothrombin Complex: A Case Report. Low cardiac output after orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) may be attributed to inadequate preload, vasodilation, and/or reduced inotropy. Inadequate preload because of an inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombus is a rare cause of low cardiac output and not frequently described in the literature. Although the use of prothrombin complex (PCC) has been associated with thrombus formation, its contribution to life-threatening IVC thrombosis has yet to be described. This case report describes the use of perioperative ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of a low cardiac output state induced by an IVC thrombus in an OHT recipient who received PCC.
