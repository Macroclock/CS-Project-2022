Spanish Heart Transplantation Registry. 27th Official Report of the Spanish Society of Cardiology Working Group on Heart Failure and Heart Transplantation (1984-2015). The present article reports the characteristics and results of heart transplants in Spain since this therapeutic modality was first used in May 1984. We describe the main features of recipients, donors, surgical procedures, and results of all heart transplants performed in Spain until December 31, 2015. A total of 299 cardiac transplants were performed in 2015, with the whole series comprising 7588 procedures. The main transplant features in 2015 were similar to those observed in recent years. A remarkably high percentage of transplants were performed under emergency conditions and there was widespread use of circulatory assist devices, particularly continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices prior to transplant (16% of all transplants). Survival has significantly improved in the last decade compared with previous time periods. During the last few years, between 250 and 300 heart transplants have consistently been performed each year in Spain. Despite a more complex clinical context, survival has increased in recent years.
