[Use of near-infrared spectroscopy for control of limb perfusion during venoarterial ECMO treatment : Application and limitations]. Patients undergoing peripheral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation have a high risk of lower limb ischemia. In general, regular controls are carried out based on clinical and laboratory parameters in order to quickly detect and treat complications. These controls are challenging due to states of shock, nonpulsatile flow and vasopressor therapy. As additional monitoring the use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is described in the literature as being very successful in detecting ischemia. The present article describes the use and possible limitations of NIRS for the diagnostics of peripheral ischemia.
