Visceral leishmaniasis in lung transplantation. Infection by intracellular microorganisms with a special geographic distribution, such as Leishmania spp, has been reported in a limited number of patients undergoing solid-organ transplant (SOT). No cases of Leishmania spp infection in lung transplant patients were found in a review of the literature. In our series of 222 lung or heart and lung transplantations performed from February 1990 to October 2002, two cases of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) were diagnosed and treated with liposomal amphotericin B. All cases reported to date in transplant patients, including the ones discussed here, occurred in people living in or traveling to countries in the Mediterranean area. We therefore consider it advisable to include serological testing for latent infection due to Leishmania spp in pretransplantation screening for our geographical setting, despite the limited return of this strategy.
