The effect of Asarinin on Toll-like pathway in rats after cardiac allograft implantation. The objective of this study was to study the mechanism of the anti-rejection effect of Asarinin in rats that underwent cardiac allograft implantation. Hearts from Wistar rats were transplanted into the abdominal cavity of Sprague Dawley rats (SD rats) 64 SD rats received either cyclosporin A (CsA), Asarinin, or demi-dose of cyclosporine A and Asarinin through oral administration. On the seventh day post-transplantation, the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 3 (CXCR3) in myocardium, and the level of interleukin (IL)-12 in the peripheral blood were analyzed 7 days after transplantation. The survival time in 3 groups (CsA group, Asarinin group, and semi-dose CsA group) prolonged (P < .01), the microscope myocardial histopathology in 3 groups (CsA group, Asarinin group and semi-dose CsA group) relieved, the expression of TLR4 and CXCR3 in 3 groups was significantly decreased (P < .01) when compared with the control group. The level of IL-12 decreased remarkably (P < .05) in the 3 groups when compared with the control group. The combined data suggested that Asarinin decreased peripheral blood concentration of IL-12 and inhibited the expression of TLR4 and CXCR3, which means Asarinin may have a role on TLR4 pathway and produced prolongation of allograft heart survival.
