Comparative pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus in de novo pediatric transplant recipients randomized to receive immediate- or prolonged-release tacrolimus. Phase 2, parallel-group, multicenter, open-label, 4-week study, comparing PK of PR-T vs IR-T in de novo pediatric patients undergoing primary kidney, liver, or heart transplantation. Patients randomized 1:1 to receive once daily, PR-T-, or twice-daily, IR-T-based regimens; dose adjustments permitted after Day 1. Twenty-four-hour PK profiles collected on Days 1, 7, and 28. Primary endpoint: tacrolimus AUC 'heart transplantation', 'kidney transplantation', 'liver transplantation', 'pediatrics', 'pharmacokinetics', 'tacrolimus'
