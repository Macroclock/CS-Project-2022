Acromegalic Cardiomyopathy With Malignant Arrhythmogenic Pattern Successfully Treated With Mechanical Circulatory Support and Heart Transplantation. Cardiovascular involvement is common in acromegaly and can lead to development of acromegalic cardiomyopathy, characterized by concentric biventricular hypertrophy with a progressive impairment of diastolic and systolic function. The onset of heart failure and arrhythmias are related to poor prognosis. We report on a case of a 48-year-old man with acromegalic cardiomyopathy caused by pituitary adenoma. Despite the successful trans-sphenoidal resection of the tumour, the patient was rehospitalized for ventricular arrhythmic storms that led to cardiogenic shock, which required mechanical hemodynamic support with intra-aortic balloon pump, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and urgent heart transplantation.
