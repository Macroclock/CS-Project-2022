Cardiopulmonary, biomarkers, and vascular responses to acute hypoxia following cardiac transplantation. Previous studies have suggested good adaptation of cardiac transplant (CTx) recipients to exposure to a high altitude. No studies have investigated the cardiopulmonary and biomarker responses to acute hypoxic challenges following CTx. Thirty-six CTx recipients and 17 age-matched healthy controls (HC) were recruited. Sixteen (16) patients (42%) had cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV).
