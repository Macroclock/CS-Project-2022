Perturbation of leukocyte function-associated antigen-1/intercellular adhesion molecule-1 results in differential outcomes in cardiac vs islet allograft survival. Various studies indicate the requirements for tolerance induction may vary between different transplanted tissues and organs. Consequently, we compared the efficacy of anti-leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)/anti-intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) monoclonal antibody therapy for facilitating cardiac vs islet long-term allograft acceptance in mice. BALB/c (H-2d) mouse cardiac or islet allografts were transplanted into recipient CBA/J (H-2k) mice. Monoclonal anti-body therapy with anti-LFA-1, anti-ICAM-1, the combination, or control rat immunoglobulin (Ig) was administered intraperitoneally on Days 0 to 5. Cardiac allograft function was assessed by palpation and islet graft function by blood glucose monitoring. Mixed lymphocyte assays were performed to assess proliferation of CD4 and CD8 T-cells under conditions of stimulator-cell ICAM-1 and/or LFA-1 deficiency. Anti-ICAM-1 therapy resulted in a modest prolongation of cardiac allografts but in pronounced survival of islet allografts. Anti-LFA-1 therapy promoted significant long-term survival of both cardiac and islet allografts. Surprisingly, combined anti-LFA-1/anti-ICAM-1 therapy abrogated long-term islet, but not cardiac, allograft acceptance relative to either monotherapy. Mixed lymphocyte reactions demonstrated complete blockade of CD4 and CD8 T-cell proliferation under conditions of ICAM-1 deficiency alone or in combination with anti-LFA-1 therapy. These results indicate that optimal therapies for some allografts (vascularized-heart) may not translate to other types of allografts (cellular-islet). Thus, the type of transplant represents an independent variable for optimizing strategies to promote indefinite allograft acceptance. Complete inhibition of CD4 and CD8 T-cell proliferation during ICAM-1/LFA-1 blockade suggests a threshold signal may be dependent upon ICAM-1/LFA-1 for regulatory tolerance to occur and that this signal may be lost under conditions of minimal graft cellular mass.
