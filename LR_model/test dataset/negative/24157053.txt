Successful extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for right heart failure after heart transplantation-2 case reports and literature review. After heart transplantation (HT), transient right heart failure (RHF) is common. If it does not improve with appropriate medical therapy, we must consider mechanical support. Recently, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has shown better results than a right ventricular assist device or retransplantation. Two HT patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy had cold ischemic times beyond >240 minutes. After HT, their right heart function worsened and was unresponsive to medical therapy. After our application of ECMO, weaning was successful and the patients were discharged without complication. Early application of ECMO for RHF after HT is a good option.
