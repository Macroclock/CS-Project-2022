To describe relative's experiences before and during the patient's hospital stay as well as during the first 6 months after a heart or lung transplantation. Using qualitative content analysis, 15 relatives (eight women and seven men) aged 36-65 years were interviewed within 6 months of a heart or lung transplantation. Three categories that illuminate relatives' experiences have been identified: "Navigate specific circumstances," "Facilitate throughout the transplantation journey" and "Experiences of strength and weakness of information and support." The relatives reported involvement in the transplantation decision, peer support, information seeking, burden and coping.
