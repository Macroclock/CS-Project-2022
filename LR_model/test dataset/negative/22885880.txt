Subzero 24-hr nonfreezing rat heart preservation: a novel preservation method in a variable magnetic field. A new supercooling system using a variable magnetic field has been recently developed. Subzero nonfreezing preservation has been believed to be a beneficial method because of the lower metabolic rate. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic and metabolic effects of rat heart preservation in a variable magnetic field without cryoprotectants. Rat hearts were perfused ex vivo for 120 min after 24-hr preservation in two groups (n=6 each): (1) conventional storage group, in which the hearts were stored at 4째C, and (2) the subzero group, in which the hearts were preserved at -3째C in a variable magnetic field. Reperfusion cardiac performance after preservation was significantly preserved in the subzero group compared with the conventional group with respect to heart rate, coronary flow, the peak positive dP/dt, and the peak negative dP/dt (P<0.05). Edema after reperfusion was significantly decreased (P<0.05), and the adenosine triphosphate level was higher in the subzero group (P<0.05). The rat hearts preserved in a variable magnetic field at -3째C showed better hemodynamic and metabolic performance than those preserved using conventional storage at 4째C.
