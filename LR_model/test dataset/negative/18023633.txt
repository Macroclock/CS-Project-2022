Allopeptides and the alloimmune response. The inherent ability of the host immune system to distinguish between self- and non-self forms the basis of allorecognition. T lymphocytes constitute the most important effector arm of allorecognition. Here we describe the fundamentals of direct and indirect pathways by which allopeptides are presented to effector T cells. The nature of allopeptides presented along with tolerogenic strategies like altered peptide ligands and intra- or extra-thymic allopeptide inoculation are discussed. In addition, we speculate on the potential of regulatory T cells to modulate alloimmune responses.
