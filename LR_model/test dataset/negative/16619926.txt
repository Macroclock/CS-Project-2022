The body electric: a review of literature on implantable cardioverter defibrillators. The number of scientific research studies expounding the efficacy and effectiveness of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is prolific. The results from clinical trials that have led to the acceptance of implanting the human heart with an ICD are not as convincing as medical science would have health-care consumers believe. There are many other scientific studies that deal with the hazards involved in heart implantation with an ICD. It is argued in this paper that the impact of heart implantation with an ICD is hazardous to a person's being in significant ways. Heart implantation with an ICD is hazardous to physiological wellbeing, to psychosocial wellbeing, and to quality-of-life wellbeing. It is also argued that although humanistic studies are beginning to filter through the maze of scientific studies, many gaps remain in ICD research. Scientific researchers agree that there remains much needed knowledge for cardiac patients, their family members, and for health professionals.
