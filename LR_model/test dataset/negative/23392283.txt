Isolated sinonasal posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder: a clinical and radiographic invasive fungal sinusitis look-a-like. Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a known complication of solid organ transplantation with chronic immunosuppression. We present a unique case that illustrates PTLD mimicking invasive fungal sinusitis both clinically and radiographically. This report addresses the critical diagnostic evaluation and management of PTLD arising from the paranasal sinuses.
