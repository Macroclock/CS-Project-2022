Effect of plasmapheresis for acute humoral rejection after heart transplantation. The objective of this study was to report our experience of treating acute humoral rejection with plasmapheresis in heart transplant (HT) recipients. From May 1996 to December 2005, 238 HTs were performed using therapy with cyclosporine or tacrolimus, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone as well as induction treatment with rabbit anti-human thymocyte globulin. Endomyocardial biopsy for rejection surveillance was performed weekly for the first month, monthly for 3 months, yearly after the first year, and whenever rejection was suspected. Immunofluorescence studies with IgG, IgM, C3, C4, C1q, and HLA-DR were performed routinely on the first month biopsy. After a 2-year trial, immunofluorescence studies were not performed routinely, because no significant findings were observed; thus they were performed only when clinical deterioration, unstable hemodynamic status, or suspicion of rejection occurred on routine echocardiographic examinations. Plasmapheresis with fresh frozen plasma exchanging twice the blood volume of the patients was performed for 5 days. Rescue immunosuppression with methylprednisolone (1 g/d) was delivered for 3 days and the immunosuppressants changed, but no intravenous immunoglobulin was prescribed. Twelve patients suffered biopsy-proven acute humoral rejection at 3 days to 32 months after HT (mean, 9.4 months). Immunofluorescence studies showed positive HLA-DR in 7 patients; IgG in 4 patients; IgM in 1 patient; C3 in 4 patients; C4 in 1 patient; and C1q in 1 patient. One patient who was 3 months after HT showed only C1q positive but was treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and intra-aortic balloon pumping support and died 1-month after plasmapheresis. Another patient who deteriorated on the 3rd postoperative day and died 3 days after plasmapheresis was considered to have vascular rejection by interstitial edema, vacuolated endothelial cells and no pathognomonic clinical features, although there was no positive immunofluorescence result. All other subjects were discharged from the hospital, although 3 required mechanical support during plasmapheresis. Hypotension with hypocalcemia was frequently noted during plasmapheresis. The 1-year survival rate was 75% +/- 11%, and 5-year survival rate, 51% +/- 15%. Plasmapheresis with concurrent rescue immunosuppression was an effective treatment for acute humoral rejection in HT even with unstable hemodynamics.
