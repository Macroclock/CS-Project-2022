Simultaneous administration of a low-dose mixture of donor bone marrow cells and splenocytes plus adenovirus containing the CTLA4Ig gene result in stable mixed chimerism and long-term survival of cardiac allograft in rats. T-cell costimulatory blockade combined with donor bone marrow transfusion may induce mixed chimerism, rendering robust tolerance in transplanted organs and cells. However, most protocols entail high doses of donor bone marrow cells (BMCs) or repeated administration of costly agents that block costimulatory pathways, thus delaying clinical development. To circumvent these shortcomings, we developed a strategy in which the dosage of donor BMCs was reduced but compensated by donor splenocytes (SPLCs). Furthermore, repeated administration of costly agents was replaced with a single injection of adenovirus expressing a gene of interest. In rat cardiac transplantation models, cardiac allografts from DA (RT-1a) rats were transplanted heterotopically into the abdomen of LEW (RT-11) recipient rats. Immediately after cardiac transplantation, an adenovirus vector (AdCTLA4Ig; 5 x 10(9) plaque-forming units) containing the gene for CTLA4Ig was administered to recipients (n = 6) simultaneously with a low dose of donor BMCs (1 x 10(8)/rat) and SPLCs (5 x 10(7)/rat) via the portal vein. The treated LEW recipient rats developed long-lasting mixed chimerism (>10% at >100 days) and exhibited long-term cardiac allografts (mean survival time of > 200 days) compared with control recipients. Moreover, recipients displaying long-lasting mixed chimerism accepted subsequent donor skin allografts while promptly rejecting third-party skin allografts. These results suggest that blockade of the CD28-B7 pathway, using adenovirus-mediated CTLA4Ig gene transfer, in concert with a low dosage of donor BMCs and SPLCs, may represent a feasible strategy to induce stable mixed chimerism and permit long-term survival of cardiac allografts.
