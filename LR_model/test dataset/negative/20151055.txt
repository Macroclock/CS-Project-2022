Mechanical assist and transplantation for treatment of giant cell myocarditis. A case of Epstein-Barr virus-related acute giant cell myocarditis in a 16-year-old boy is reported. Fulminant heart failure was successfully treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a bridge to urgent heart transplantation, and was again necessary after transplantation because of acute right heart failure. Clinical management and postoperative surveillance of this unusual problem are presented and discussed.
