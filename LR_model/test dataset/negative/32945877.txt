Evaluation of Case Volumes of a Heart Transplant Program and Short-term Outcomes After Changes in the United Network for Organ Sharing Donor Heart Allocation System. Institution-level strategic changes may be associated with heart transplant volume and outcomes. To describe changes in practice that markedly increased heart transplant volume at a single center, as well as associated patient characteristics and outcomes. A pre-post cohort study was conducted of 107 patients who underwent heart transplant between September 1, 2014, and August 31, 2019, at Yale New Haven Hospital before (September 1, 2014, to August 31, 2018; prechange era) and after (September 1, 2018, to August 31, 2019; postchange era) a strategic change in patient selection by the heart transplant program. Strategic change in donor and recipient selection at Yale New Haven Hospital that occurred in August 2018. Outcome measures were transplant case volume, donor and recipient characteristics, and 180-day survival. A total of 49 patients (12.3 per year; 20 women [40.8%]; median age, 57 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 50-63 years]) received heart transplants in the 4 years of the prechange era and 58 patients (58 per year; 19 women [32.8%]; median age, 57 years [IQR, 52-64 years]) received heart transplants in the 1 year of the postchange era. Organ offers were more readily accepted in the postchange era, with an offer acceptance rate of 20.5% (58 of 283) compared with 6.4% (49 of 768) in the prechange era (P < .001). In the postchange era, donor hearts were accepted with a higher median number of prior refusals by other centers than in the prechange era (16.5 [IQR, 6-38] vs 3 [IQR, 1-6]; P < .001). Hearts accepted in the postchange era were from older donors than in the prechange era (median age, 40 years [IQR, 29-48 years] vs 30 years [IQR, 24-42 years]; P < .001). Recipients had a significantly shorter time on the waiting list in the postchange era compared with prechange era (median, 41 days [IQR, 12-289 days] vs 242 days [IQR, 135-428 days]; P < .001). More patients were supported on temporary circulatory assist devices preoperatively in the postchange era than the prechange era (14 [24.1%] vs 0; P < .001). Survival rates at 180 days were not significantly different (43 [87.8%] in the prechange era vs 52 [89.7%] in the postchange era). Mortality while on the waiting list was similar (2.8 deaths per year in the prechange era vs 3 deaths per year in the postchange era). During the comparable time period, 4 other regional centers had volume change ranging from -10% to 68%, while this center's volume increased by 374%. This study suggests that strategic changes in donor heart and recipient selection may significantly increase the number of heart transplants while maintaining short-term outcomes comparable with more conservative patient selection. Such an approach may augment the allocation of currently unused donor hearts.
