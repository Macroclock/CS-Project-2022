Additive immunosuppressive effect of hydroxycamptothecin and cyclosporine on rejection of heart transplantation in rats. The objective of this study was to study the inhibitory effects of hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) and cyclosporine (CsA) on heart transplantation rejection in rats. Inbred SD rats were used as donors and inbred Wistar rats as recipients. Cervical heterotopic heart transplantation was performed in 40 rats: group A received placebo; group B, HCPT; group C, CsA; group D, HCPT+CsA. The mean survival time was prolonged in group D with 5 grafts beating at more than 730 days. HCPT combined with CsA prevented acute rejection of allogeneic heart transplantations in rats, significantly prolonging graft mean survival time.
