Differential chemokine and chemokine receptor gene induction by ischemia, alloantigen, and gene transfer in cardiac grafts. Transplantation of allogeneic grafts presents several challenges to the innate and adaptive immune systems including chemokine leukocyte recruitment, activation, and effector function. We defined the chemokines and receptors induced by the transplant procedure/ischemia injury, alloantigen and gene transfer vector administration in murine cardiac grafts. E1, E3 deleted AdRSVbetagal was transferred into grafts at the time of transplantation, grafts were harvested after 1-14 days, and a pathway-specific cDNA array was used to evaluate the levels of 67 chemokine and chemokine receptor genes. Transplantation resulted in ischemic injury and induction of a number of similar genes in both the syngeneic and allogeneic grafts, such as CXCL1 and CXCL5, which increased dramatically on day 1 and returned rapidly to baseline in the syngeneic grafts. Alloantigen stimulated the adaptive immune response and induced the presence of more inflammatory genes within the grafts, particularly at later time points. The adenovirus vector induced a broader panel of genes, among them potent inflammatory chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, that are induced earlier or more strongly compared with alloantigen stimulation alone. As alloantigen and adenovirus vectors both induce similar sets of genes, targeting these molecules may not only inhibit alloimmunity, but also enhance the utility of the gene transfer vector.
