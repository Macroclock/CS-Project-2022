Pericardial effusion coincident with sirolimus therapy: a review of Wyeth's safety database. Sirolimus is an immunosuppressive agent approved for prophylaxis of acute rejection in renal transplant patients aged 13 years or older. A retrospective review of pericardial effusion coincident with sirolimus therapy was conducted from key clinical trials and spontaneous reporting sources. A significantly higher rate of pericardial effusion occurred with sirolimus versus azathioprine treatment in a cardiac transplantation trial (28.6% versus 9.3%, respectively). Cases of pericardial effusion were also observed in the sirolimus treatment arms of three de novo renal transplant studies (rates 0.5 to 1.9%). Although most of the pericardial effusions occurred in cardiac transplantation, sirolimus is not approved for this use. As of January 31, 2007, the Wyeth safety database (which includes clinical trial data and spontaneous reports) contained reports of pericardial effusion in 56 sirolimus-treated patients, 31 of whom required pericardial drainage. These data suggest that pericardial effusion should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a clinical deterioration in posttransplant patients treated with sirolimus. The adverse reaction of pericardial effusion has been added to product labeling.
