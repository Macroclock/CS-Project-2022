Blood cell microparticles as biomarkers of hemostatic abnormalities in patients with implanted cardiac assist devices. For heart failure patients unable to undergo cardiac transplantation, mechanical circulatory support with left ventricular assist devices can be utilized. These devices improve quality of life and prolong life expectancy, but they are associated with bleeding and thrombotic complications impacting patient survival. Little is known of the relevant mechanisms of these hemostatic issues, hindering identification of a clinically useful biomarker. However, there is suggestive evidence that blood cell-derived microparticles may fulfill this unmet clinical need. Recent publications have shown an association of up regulated microparticle production with implanted left ventricular assist devices and the potential to use this as a biomarker to predict thrombosis (and perhaps other adverse events) with an onset time earlier than currently used clinical indicators.
