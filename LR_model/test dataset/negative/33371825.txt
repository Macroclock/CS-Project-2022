Dose- and Time-Dependent Effects of Human Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Infusion on Cardiac Allograft Rejection in Mice. Heart transplantation is the final life-saving therapeutic strategy for many end-stage heart diseases. Long-term immunosuppressive regimens are needed to prevent allograft rejection. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been shown as immunomodulatory therapy for organ transplantation. However, the effect of dose and timing of MSC treatment on heart transplantation has not yet been examined. In this study, we infused three doses (1 × 10 'T regulatory cells', 'allograft rejection', 'donor-specific antibodies', 'heart transplantation', 'mesenchymal stromal cells'
