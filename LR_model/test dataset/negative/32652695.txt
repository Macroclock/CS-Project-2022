Protek Duo Rapid Deployment cannulation utilized to bridge to durable heartware left ventricular assist device. A 43-year-old gentleman was transferred for management of acute on chronic cardiogenic shock (left ventricular ejection fraction < 10%). Upon arrival, we inserted a left axillary intra-aortic balloon pump for hemodynamic support. He underwent an emergent left and right-heart catheterization which showed patent stents and coronaries, in the setting of severely elevated pulmonary artery and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. On hospital day 35, we escalated support to Centrimag in conjunction with a 31 French Protek Duo Rapid Deployment cannula. A centrimag cannula apical sewing cuff was sewn in continuous fashion along the left ventricular apex. Via modified seldinger technique, we tunneled the Protek Duo Rapid Deployment cannula through the silastic sewing cuff and the ventricular apex, traversing the aortic valve. On hospital day 50, he underwent left anterior thoracotomy and mini-sternotomy for implantation of durable Heartware left ventricular assist device. He was discharged home off inotropes and had resumed his normal activities. He is currently listed as status four for heart transplantation.
