[Cardiology units and organizational models of heart transplantation centers in Italy: a survey by the Italian Association of Hospital Cardiologists-Italian Society of Organ Transplantation (ANMCO-SITO)]. The extent and quality of the involvement of cardiology units in health programs delivered by Italian centers for heart transplantation (HTx) have not been investigated previously. The Italian Association of Hospital Cardiologists (ANMCO) and the Italian Society for Organ Transplantation (SITO) developed and delivered a nationwide survey to the Directors of the Italian centers for HTx to investigate the extent to which cardiology units contribute to HTx programs. The survey investigated: (i) the organization of the centers and institutional frame under which cardiology units contributed to HTx programs; (ii) the volumes of procedures and clinical services delivered by cardiology units to HTx centers for listing patients, following those waiting for HTx, managing acute heart failure, selecting and allocating organs to recipients, following and managing organ rejection after HTx. Of the 14 Italian centers involved, 13 provided full responses to the survey. Between 2017-2019, on average, 46% of the respondents performed up to 15 HTx/year, and additional 46% performed between 16 and 30 HTx/year. Of the respondents, 62% were included in a department of cardiac Surgery which did not include a cardiology unit; furthermore, 54% declared not to be included in a formal network for heart failure management. Cardiology units were the source for referrals of candidates to HTx in 85% cases. Of the respondents, 15% declared to be able to provide cardiological services thorough intra-center multidisciplinary team including cardiologists, whereas cardiological services were outsourced in 61% of the respondents. The clinical follow-up of patients waiting for HTx was performed directly by surgeons in 38% of the respondents. Worsening heart failure was managed directly by the HTx center in 33% of the cases using dedicated beds. Post-HTx follow-up, including endomyocardial biopsy, involved external cardiology units in less than 25% of the centers. The ANMCO-SITO survey shows that in Italy a very wide variability exists in terms of organization of HTx centers and their relationships with cardiology units for delivering specific cardiological services and procedures. In large majority, patient referral to HTx centers is mediated by cardiology units, whereas HTx was rarely included in a structured cardiological network for heart failure management.
