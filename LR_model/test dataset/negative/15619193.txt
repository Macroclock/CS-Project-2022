Progress in CT imaging for the cardiac surgeon. The aim of this article is to critically assess the role of multidetector-row CT (MDCT) in the field of cardiothoracic surgery. In the beginning, a short overview is given about technical aspects such as scan protocols, optimal image reconstruction, image reformation techniques, data evaluation, and data presentation. This is followed by sections about possible indications for cardiothoracic surgery and future prospects for this technology. For the cardiac surgeon, the main benefit of MDCT lies in the combination of large scan-volume coverage, high spatial resolution, proper identification of calcifications, and the simultaneous registration of other thoracic structures. Preoperative applications may include the assessment of cardiac valves, noninvasive evaluation of large thoracic vessels, staging of cardiac tumors, and planning of minimally invasive surgical procedures. After surgery, MDCT examinations particularly facilitate an early identification of severe postoperative complications. MDCT may also be used to assess coronary artery bypass graft patency and to identify transplant-related complications in heart transplant recipients at an early stage. New technological developments such as 64-row MDCT or flat panel computed tomography will further increase the field of possible indications.
