Brain death interval and relationship to outcomes of pediatric cardiac transplantation. We sought to analyze brain death interval and outcomes of pediatric cardiac transplantation using national registry data. We retrospectively evaluated a pediatric cohort from the UNOS registry from 2005 to 2014. We restricted the donor cohort to those with a primary central nervous system event as the cause of hospitalization. Brain death interval (BDI) was defined as the time between hospital admission and organ procurement. Primary outcomes were recipient and graft survival time. Logistical regression modeling was used for multivariable analysis. The donor cohort included 2565 cases. Multivariable analysis demonstrated no relationship between BDI and recipient or graft survival time. For patient survival time, the lowest HR was 0.94 (0.63-1.39), P = 0.531; for graft survival time, the lowest HR was 0.89 (0.53-1.49), P = 0.563. We obtained similar results using a non-restricted donor cohort. There was no clear relationship between BDI and recipient or graft survival after pediatric cardiac transplantation.
