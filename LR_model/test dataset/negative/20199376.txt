Heart transplant in a childhood leukemia survivor: a case report. Children with acute leukemia often receive therapy that is potentially cardiotoxic. Development of irreversible cardiac impairment requiring heart transplant may appear many years after anticancer therapy. Other possible causes are discussed. We describe a young leukemia survivor who developed severe heart failure needing a heart transplant. A 4-year-old boy was treated with standard doses of chemotherapy containing cardiotoxic daunorubicin and mitoxantrone, and later, with an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. Twelve years after the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia, and following a viral infection of an unknown cause, he developed symptoms of heart failure. Severe dilated cardiomyopathy; and severe, left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 12% were noted on echocardiography. The patient required a heart transplant 19 years after the diagnosis of leukemia. Cardiac failure may progressively occur in childhood leukemia survivors. Heart transplant is indicated in patients with refractory hemodynamic decompensation.
