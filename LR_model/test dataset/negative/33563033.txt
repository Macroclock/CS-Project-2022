The current era of left ventricular assist devices. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have changed the landscape of treatment options for patients with end stage heart failure. Due to the limited availability of donor hearts for transplantation, LVADs have become an important option for many of these patients. Much progress has been made in the device industry since then, and newer devices continue to improve patient outcomes. In this review, we will discuss some of the key transitions in LVADs over the years, the current LVADs used in practice today, implantation techniques, the impact of the new heart allocation system on LVAD useÂ and future prospective LVADs.
