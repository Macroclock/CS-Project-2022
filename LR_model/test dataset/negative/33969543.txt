Post-transplant inotrope score is associated with clinical outcomes after adult heart transplantation. Inotrope score has been proposed as a marker of clinical outcome after adult heart transplantation (HTx) but is rarely used in practice. Inotrope score during the first 48 h after HTx was calculated in 81 patients as: dopamine + dobutamine + amrinone + milrinone (dose × 15) + epinephrine (dose × 100) + norepinephrine (dose × 100) + enoximone + isoprenaline (dose × 100), with each drug in µg/kg/min. Determinants of inotrope score were identified with linear regression. Cox regression was used to determine the association of inotrope score with mortality. The mean recipient age was 52 ± 11 years, and 32 (39.5%) patients were female. Determinants of inotrope score were preoperative C-reactive protein, serum urea, congenital heart disease, and donor cardiac arrest (R High inotrope score post-HTx was observed in recipient congenital heart disease and was associated with a higher risk of mortality and acute kidney injury.
