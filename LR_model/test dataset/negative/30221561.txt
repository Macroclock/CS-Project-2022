Total artificial heart implantation as a bridge to transplantation: a viable model for the future? Since the first total artificial heart (TAH) surgery in a human patient performed in 1969, over 1300 devices have been implanted worldwide. Patients are benefiting from increased lengths of durable support and indications have expanded beyond biventricular failure including allograft failure, severe restrictive disease, and complex congenital anomalies. Areas covered: The role of the TAH in biventricular failure, rates of successful bridge-to-transplant (BTT), and survival compared with biventricular assist devices (BiVADs) are discussed and differences between TAH and LVAD patient populations are highlighted. The device's niche role in physiologies not amenable to single ventricle support is further described. New developments such as the 50cc Syncardia, continuous flow mechanisms (BiVACOR and Cleveland Clinic CF-TAH), and a bioprosthetic model (CARMAT) are discussed. Literature review was conducted utilizing the PubMed database selecting published research, database analyses, and case reports under 'total artificial heart' relevant to the paper's aims. Expert commentary: TAH patients have high rates of successful BTT and survival on par with BiVAD-supported patients. Ongoing developments including decreased device size, continuous flow mechanisms, and use of bioprosthetic materials will ensure that the TAH will have an increasing role in advanced heart failure with increased device longevity and decreased post-implant complications.
