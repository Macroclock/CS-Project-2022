Pulmonary nodules caused by Schizophyllum commune after cardiac transplantation. The incidence of pulmonary nodules after cardiac transplantation is not uncommon, and prompt diagnostic procedures are necessary to minimize disease-related morbidity and mortality. We report a 56-year-old woman who was found to have bilateral pulmonary nodules four months after cardiac transplantation. The microorganism was identified with a molecular diagnostic method as Schizophyllum commune, which had not been reported in English literature as a pathogen inducing pulmonary nodules after transplantation. She remained asymptomatic during the therapeutic period and the pulmonary nodules resolved six months later.
