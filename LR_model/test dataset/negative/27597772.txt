Evaluation of Direct Oral Anticoagulation Therapy in Heart and Lung Transplant Recipients. Anticoagulation therapy is common in thoracic transplant recipients. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are alternatives to warfarin therapy, but characterization of their use in solid organ transplant is absent. The primary objective of this study was to describe a thoracic transplant patient population initiated on DOAC therapy. Secondary objectives were to assess adverse reactions, venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence, and drug-drug interactions during DOAC therapy. Single-center retrospective cohort study. A tertiary care medical center including inpatient hospitalization and outpatient transplant clinic visits. Thoracic transplant recipients who were initiated on DOACs between May 1, 2011, and March 1, 2015, at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center were included. A total of 37 patients were included in the analysis. A majority of the patients were lung transplant recipients (86.4%) with a median age of 60.7 years. Twenty-eight patients had a history of VTE. The primary indication for DOAC initiation was VTE (86.5%). Rivaroxaban (78.4%) was the most commonly utilized agent. Dose reductions for major drug interactions (37.8%), renal insufficiency (10.8%), or both (8.1%) occurred within the study. Two patients had breakthrough VTE during DOAC therapy. Eight bleeding events were reported in the cohort, one of which was considered a major bleed. There was no difference in the incidence of bleeding in patients with drug-drug interactions and without drug-drug interactions during DOAC therapy (26.0% vs 7.1%, P = .154). Direct oral anticoagulant therapy was well tolerated by thoracic transplant recipients. Drug interactions and renal dose adjustments were common.
