CD4(+)CD25(-)Nrp1(+) T cells synergize with rapamycin to prevent murine cardiac allorejection in immunocompetent recipients. Besides CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs), other immunosuppressive T cells also participated in the regulation of immune tolerance. Reportedly, neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) might be one of the molecules by which regulatory cells exert their suppressive effects. Indeed, CD4(+)CD25(-)Nrp1(+) T cells exhibit potent suppressive function in autoimmune inflammatory responses. Here we investigated the specific role of CD4(+)CD25(-)Nrp1(+) T cells in the setting of the transplant immune response. Through MLR assays, we found that CD4(+)CD25(-)Nrp1(+) T cells suppressed the proliferation of naive CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells activated by allogeneic antigen-stimulation. Adoptive transfer of CD4(+)CD25(-)Nrp1(+) T cells synergized with rapamycin to induce long-term graft survival in fully MHC-mismatched murine heart transplantation, which was associated with decreased IFN-γ, IL-17 and increased IL-10, TGF-β, Foxp3 and Nrp1 expression in the grafts. Importantly, our data indicated that CD4(+)CD25(-)Nrp1(+) T cell transfer augments the accumulation of Tregs in the recipient, and creates conditions that favored induction of hyporesponsiveness of the T effector cells. In conclusion, this translational study indicates the possible therapeutic potential of CD4(+)CD25(-)Nrp1(+) T cells in preventing allorejection. CD4(+)Nrp1(+) T cells might therefore be used in bulk as a population of immunosuppressive cells with more beneficial properties concerning ex vivo isolation as compared to Foxp3(+) Tregs.
