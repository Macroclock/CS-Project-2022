Acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease after non-kidney solid organ transplantation. SOT is the treatment of choice for end-stage organ disease. Improved long-term survival after NKSOT has uncovered chronic morbidity including CKD. AKI is common after NKSOT and may be associated with long-term CKD. We performed a retrospective cohort study looking at AKI and CKD after pediatric heart (n = 109) or liver (n = 112) transplant. AKI was defined using KDIGO creatinine-based criteria. pAKI was AKI ≤ 7 days post-transplant; CKD pAKI was seen in 63% (n = 69) after heart and 38% (n = 43) after liver transplant. pAKI was associated with longer ICU and hospital stays. Cumulative incidence (95% CI) of CKD pAKI and CKD are common after NKSOT. Incidence of CKD is higher in those with pAKI. AKI episodes are associated with a drop in eGFR during follow-up. Identifying patients who have had AKI is an important first step in identifying those at risk of repeated AKI episodes. These patients would benefit from closer monitoring for CKD, lower nephrotoxic drug use, and follow-up with nephrology.
