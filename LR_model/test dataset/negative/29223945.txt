[Heart transplantation in an HIV-infected patient]. Because of its own unfavourable evolution, HIV infection was until recently considered a contraindication for organ transplantation. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy prolonged the life expectancy of these patients and allowed the manifestation of disorders directly or indirectly related to HIV infection, mainly liver, kidney and cardiovascular diseases. We present a case of cardiac transplantation due to dilated cardiomyopathy that was performed in a patient with a recently detected HIV infection. At 24 month follow-up, the patient is in very good health status, his CD4 are increasing and the viral load is undetectable. He did not present transplant rejection or any other complication. To our knowledge, there is no previous publication on heart transplantation in patients with HIV in South America. In view of the successful outcome of our case and of the few cases reported in the international literature, we consider that heart transplantation is a therapeutic option in correctly selected HIV patients.
