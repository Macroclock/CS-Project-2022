Mycophenolate mofetil significantly reduces leukocyte graft infiltration after heterotopic cardiac transplantation in a rat model: comparative study with cyclosporine and FK 506. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of cyclosporine (CsA), FK 506 and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on graft-infiltrating leukocytes (CD4, CD8, CD11a, CD18) after cardiac transplantation in rats. Three hundred forty animals were transplanted and randomly divided into 4 groups: CsA, 3 mg/kg/d (n = 74); MMF, 40 mg/kg/d (n = 96); FK 506, 0.3 mg/kg/d (n = 96); and a control group receiving no immunosuppressive therapy (n = 74). Three or 4 animals from each group were killed at intervals of 1 to 4 days up to Day 60. Immunohistochemistry was performed using monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against CD4, CD8, CD11a and CD18. Positively stained cells were analyzed in the perivascular space (PVS) of intra- and epicardial arteries. Statistical analysis was performed using area-under-the-curve assessment with an extended t-test. CsA and FK 506 reduced the presence graft-infiltrating leukocytes (CD4, CD8, CD11a, CD18) in the PVS of intra- and epicardial arteries when compared with control animals. MMF therapy resulted in a further significant reduction in infiltrating leukocytes when compared with the 2 calcineurin inhibitors. MMF had a faster onset of action than the calcineurin inhibitors. CsA and FK 506 required 12 to 20 additional days to achieve the reducing effect of graft infiltration seen in MMF-treated animals. MMF possesses potent infiltration-blocking properties and its application leads to a greater reduction of cellular infiltration in the course of transplant rejection when compared with calcineurin inhibitors.
