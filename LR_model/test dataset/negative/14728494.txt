Facilitating heart transplant candidate evaluation throughout Ohio. The Ohio Solid Organ Transplantation Consortium (OSOTC) has a mission to ensure equitable access to transplant services to those most likely to benefit, regardless of personal resources. Patients are selected according to criteria established by the OSOTC, which are delineated in the Ohio Department of Health rule, and consistent with national criteria. The University of Cincinnati's Institute for Health Policy and Health Services Research (IHPHSR) has implemented a secure internet-based system to replace the OSOTC's existing fax-based procedures. This system meets both the patient evaluation and basic research needs of the OSOTC.
