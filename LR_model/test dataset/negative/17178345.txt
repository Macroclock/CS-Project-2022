Mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to combined dual organ transplantation in children. The use of mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to cardiac transplantation is now an accepted therapeutic option. Also, as the criteria for organ transplantation have broadened, multi-organ transplantation has become more feasible. We report the cases of 2 children with end-stage heart failure and renal failure who were successfully bridged to combined, single-donor heart and kidney transplantation with mechanical circulatory support.
