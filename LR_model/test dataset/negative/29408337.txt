Combined intraocular and systemic rituximab for ocular lymphoproliferative disorder with extranodal marginal zone lymphoma-type morphology after heart transplant. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) has rarely been associated with ocular manifestations. We report a case of bilateral ocular involvement by PTLD with histopathologic features of extranodal marginal zone (MALT) lymphoma in an 8-year-old boy following orthotopic heart transplantation. The anterior segment disease was treated successfully using a combination of intraocular and systemic injections of humanized anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab).
