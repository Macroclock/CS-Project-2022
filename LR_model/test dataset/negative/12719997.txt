Toxoplasma gondii retinochoroiditis after cardiac transplantation. To report 4 cases of Toxoplasma gondii retinochoroiditis in patients having recently undergone cardiac transplantation. Review of medical records for 4 patients presenting retinochoroiditis and evidence of T. gondii infection. Patient ranged in age from 25 to 53 years. Ocular symptoms began between 3 and 6 months after transplantation. All patients were under immunosuppressive therapy. Foci of retinochoroiditis were observed unilaterally in three patients and bilaterally in one. Intraocular inflammation was minimal in all cases. Serologic responses were highly suggestive of T. gondii as the etiology in all cases; other causes (CMV retinitis and syphilis) were actively sought and were not found. All patients underwent classic therapy. The three unilateral cases evolved favorably, but the bilateral case, seen late, showed extensive macular scarring. Infectious retinochoroiditis is a potentially blinding complication seen after cardiac transplantation, justifying close clinical and serological surveillance or, in certain cases such as mismatched donors, anti-parasitic prophylaxis.
