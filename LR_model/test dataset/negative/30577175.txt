Operative Techniques and Pitfalls in Donor Heart-Lung Procurement. Heart-lung transplantation is a well-established therapeutic modality for concomitant end-stage heart and lung failure. With growing organ scarcity, the rates of these transplants are declining, and center experience is waning. With over 35 years of experience performing heart-lung transplantation, we describe our procurement protocol herein, as well as offer suggestions to avoid potential pitfalls in order to ensure technical excellence in harvesting these valuable grafts. Procurement issues most commonly arise with organ preservation and inadvertent damage to structures that are difficult to fully visualize. En-bloc heart-lung procurement can be taught effectively and safely to trainees with an emphasis on avoiding common pitfalls that may compromise graft function.
