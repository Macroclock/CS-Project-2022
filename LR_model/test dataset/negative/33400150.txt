Markers of Immune Function in Heart Transplantation: Implications for Immunosuppression and Screening for Rejection. Recent developments in high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing technologies have facilitated the development of noninvasive assays to monitor heart transplant rejection. In this review, we summarize existing assays employed for the surveillance of allograft rejection, as well as promising future directions for such tests in the molecular biology field. The AlloMap genome expression profiling assay remains the only noninvasive test for rejection surveillance and is incorporated into the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines. Other efforts have focused on messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) as potential viable biomarkers. Mitochondrial pathways in allograft necroptosis and inflammation signaling may represent a novel direction for future research endeavors. Although endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard, several converging areas of molecular biology could soon yield successful alternative methods of heart transplant rejection monitoring, with the distinct advantage of avoiding procedural complications.
