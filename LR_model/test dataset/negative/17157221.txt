sHLA-G levels in the monitoring of immunosuppressive therapy and rejection following heart transplantation. The aim of this study was to further determine the immediate influence, over a 12-h period, after the initiation of daily immunosuppressive treatment on the serum levels of sHLA-G in heart transplant patients during the post-transplant period (1 month). It was found that there are two patterns of patients in term of the changes observed in their levels of sHLA-G in response to the immunosuppressive treatment. One group (group A) showed no changes on sHLA-G while the other group (group B) a significant rise in sHLA-G levels was observed at 2 to 4 h post dose. Interestingly, it was observed that the patients in group B have better prognosis of acceptance of the heart graft than those of group A. On the other hand it was found that the patients with high levels of sHLA-G (77.3+/-34.8 ng/ml) in pre-transplant sera have a better prognosis of acceptance of the heart graft than those with low sHLA-G levels (9.7+/-7.1 ng/ml). In conclusion, both the intensity of changes of sHLA-G levels induced by immunosuppression and basal levels in pre-transplant could be used in the monitoring of the immunosuppression as well as the heart transplant evolution.
