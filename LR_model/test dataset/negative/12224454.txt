[Ross procedure instead of heart transplantation. Recovery potential of the dysfunctional myocardium in heart failure caused by congenital aortic valve insufficiency]. The authors report a case of a child who presented in advanced valvular heart failure secondary to aortic regurgitation. Due to social circumstances heart transplantation was not a viable option, therefore a high risk pulmonary autograft aortic root replacement (Ross procedure) was performed. Following surgery a delayed but rather gratifying myocardial recovery was observed. This case represents the preserved recovery potential of the pediatric myocardium in end stage heart failure.
