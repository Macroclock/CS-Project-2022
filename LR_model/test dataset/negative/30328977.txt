Association between quality of life and prognosis of candidate patients for heart transplantation: a cross-sectional study. to verify the association between the prognostic scores and the quality of life of candidates for heart transplantation. a descriptive cross-sectional study with a convenience sample of 32 outpatients applying to heart transplantation. The prognosis was rated by the Heart Failure Survival Score (HFSS) and the Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM); and the quality of life by the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). The Pearson correlation test was applied. the correlations found between general quality of life scores and prognostic scores were (HFSS/MLHFQ r = 0.21), (SHFM/MLHFQ r = 0.09), (HFSS/KCCQ r = -0.02), (SHFM/KCCQ r = -0.20). the weak correlation between the prognostic and quality of life scores suggests a lack of association between the measures, i.e., worse prognosis does not mean worse quality of life and the same statement is true in the opposite direction.
