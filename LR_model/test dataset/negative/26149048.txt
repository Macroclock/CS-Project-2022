Pediatric transplantation: managing bleeding. There has been extraordinary progress over the last half-century in the field of medical transplantation in which tissue, organs, or body parts from one human are placed into another. Solid organ transplants have allowed thousands of children with otherwise devastating inherited or acquired disorders to survive. Depending upon the clinical situation, there are many specific peri-transplant issues that must be carefully addressed to optimize outcomes. Although surgical, immunologic, and infectious concerns are usually in the forefront, important aspects regarding hemostasis frequently arise. The number of solid organs that can be successfully transplanted in children has expanded over the last decades and includes kidney, liver, heart, lung, intestine, pancreas, and thymus. Bleeding complications may occur in the setting of organ failure prior to transplantation, during the surgical procedure, or in the post-transplant setting, and can results in significant morbidity. This report will focus on preventing and managing non-surgical-related bleeding complications in children undergoing liver, heart, kidney transplantation, in whom there are often unique aspects of coagulation to be considered.
