The future of heart transplantation. The field of heart transplantation has seen significant progress in the past 40 years. However, the breakthroughs in long-term outcome have seen stagnation in the past decade. Through advances in genomics and transcriptomics, there is hope that an era of personalized transplant therapy lies in the future. To see where heart transplantation truly fits into the long term, searching for and understanding the alternative approaches for heart failure therapy is both important and inevitable. The application of mechanical circulatory support has contributed to the largest advancement in treatment of end stage heart failure. It has already been approved for destination therapy of heart failure, and greater portability and ease of use of the device will be the future trend. Although it is still not prime time for stem cell therapy, clinical experiences have already suggested its potential therapeutic effects. And finally, whole organ engineering is on the horizon as new techniques have opened the way for this to proceed. In the end, progress on alternative therapies largely depends on our deeper understanding of the mechanisms of heart failure and how to prevent it.
