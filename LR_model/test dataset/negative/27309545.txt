Endogenous assessment of diffuse myocardial fibrosis in patients with T Recently, it was shown that a significantly higher T T A significant correlation (Pearson r = 0.49; P = 0.005) was found between ex vivo T This study showed proof of principle for the endogenous detection of diffuse myocardial fibrosis with T 2 J.
