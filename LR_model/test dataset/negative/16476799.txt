Interstitial pulmonary inflammation due to Microbacterium sp. after heart transplantation. A coryneform bacterium was isolated from the bronchoalveolar aspirate of a patient with interstitial pulmonary inflammation. Commercial systems identified the isolate as Corynebacterium sp. or Aureobacterium sp./Corynebacterium aquaticum, but 16S rRNA gene analysis unequivocally attributed it to the genus Microbacterium. This represents the first documented case of Microbacterium pulmonary infection.
