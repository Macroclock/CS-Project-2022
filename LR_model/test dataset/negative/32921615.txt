Left Ventricular Mechanical Circulatory Support-Assessing Outcomes With New Data. Ventricular assist devices continue to play a significant role in the surgical management of advanced heart failure. Left ventricular assist devices in particular have seen a rapid evolution in design, technology, implantation, and outcomes. This concise review focuses on the key data that have been published in the past 5 years that have demonstrated this rapid evolution in left-sided mechanical circulatory support from principally bridge to transplantation to destination therapy, with an increasing emphasis on quality-of-life measures and durability.
