Bridge to transplant using the MicroMed DeBakey ventricular assist device in a child with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. We report the implantation of the MicroMed DeBakey left ventricular assist device (MDBVAD) in a 10-year-old girl with cardiogenic shock secondary to an idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. This was the first pediatric implant of the MDBVAD in the United States and the youngest patient worldwide. The patient recovered well and subsequently underwent successful heart transplantation after 84 days of support.
