Quilty effect areas are frequently associated with endocardial C4d deposition. The meaning and clinical implications of the Quilty effect (QE) are not entirely clear. In some biopsies we have found complement split C4d deposition in QE areas, but we do fully comprehend the frequency or pathogenic relationships involved. The objective of this study was to gain insight into the immunologic events involved in the QE, and to understand if and how it relates to complement activation. Protocol allograft biopsies (January to December 2005) with evidence of the QE, without cellular rejection or changes suspicious for antibody-mediated rejection, were selected for C4d, CD3, CD20 and CD68 immunohistochemistry. Among 128 allograft biopsies (42 patients), 17 (11 patients) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Eleven of the 17 biopsies (64.7%), from 8 patients, showed C4d deposition in the endocardium; the positivity was interestingly linear in the endocardium and surrounded by the lymphocytes forming the Quilty lesion. In some cases, the linear C4d deposition extended to the endocardium surrounding the QE area. This pattern was not detected in any of 66 heart allograft biopsies without the QE. B cells were second to T cells in their contribution to the QE, comprising a median of 40% (range, 20% to 50%) of the cells. C4d deposition was not associated with clinical alterations. The QE is frequently associated with C4d deposition in the endocardium of patients without evidence of rejection. This event suggests a pathogenic relationship between the QE and complement activation. It is possible that the simultaneous presence of both features in an allograft heart biopsy, without evidence of rejection, indicates better adaptation of allograft to host ("accommodation"); however, the precise meaning and implications are not yet known.
