The HeartMate 6. The need for biventricular support poses significant challenges for patients who require a mechanical bridge to transplantation. Recent improvements in ventricular assist device (VAD) technology has made possible the use of two centrifugal flow VADs as a total artificial heart (TAH) replacement. The HeartMate 3 (HM3; [Full MagLev, Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, Illinois]) was recently approved as a destination therapy; this VAD has a number of unique advantages that allow for its off-label use for biventricular support. Here, we describe the use of two HM3s as a TAH in a patient as a bridge to transplant.
