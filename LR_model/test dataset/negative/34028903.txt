COVID-19 in heart transplant patients: Case reports from Brazil. The COVID-19 pandemic continues, with a late hyperinflammatory phase. The immunosuppressive therapy used in heart transplant patients, in theory, could reduce inflammation, thus benefitting patients with COVID-19. So far, however, there is still very little literature on this subject. This is a single-center retrospective study. We described laboratory parameters and clinical outcomes from 11 heart transplant patients with COVID-19 assisted at Dante Pazzanese Institute of Cardiology between March and July 2020. Patients with ages of between 35 and 79 years were enrolled, and heart transplantation ranged from 3 to 264 months. The main comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (9/11; 81.8%), hypertension (10/11; 90.9%), and chronic renal disease (6/11; 54.5%). Cyclosporine A was used in 10 (90.9%) patients, mycophenolate mofetil in 9 (81.8%) patients, and mTOR inhibitor in 5 (45.5%) patients. Fever and cough were observed in 8 (72.7%) patients, and dyspnea and gastrointestinal symptoms in 5 (45.5%) patients. Lymphopenia was observed in 10 (90.9%) patients and thrombocytopenia in 5 (45.5%) patients. The higher level of troponin associated with chest tomography above 50% of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with ground-glass opacity (GGO) was observed in those with the worst outcomes. Nine patients needed intensive care, and hospital stay ranged from 4 to 21 days, with 2 (18.2%) patients requiring vasopressor drugs and mechanical ventilation, and three (27.3%) patients dying due to COVID-19 complications. Heart transplant patients had similar symptoms and outcomes as the general population; immunosuppressive therapy seems not to have protected them. Patients who presented higher levels of troponin and D-dimer, associated with greater GGO pulmonary infiltrates, had worse outcomes. More studies with larger cohorts may clarify immunosuppressive effects on COVID-19 outcomes. 'COVID-19', 'D-dimer', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'heart transplantation', 'troponin'
