Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio in clinically stable pediatric heart transplant recipients. A study of the T wave peak-to-end (Tp-e) interval, the Tp-e/QT ratio, and the Tp-e/QTc ratio in pediatric heart transplant recipients (HTRs), a group which has a higher risk of sudden cardiac death than the normal population, has not previously been reported. The aim of this study was to assess alterations in ventricular repolarization using the Tp-e interval, Tp-e/ QT ratio, and Tp-e/QTc ratio in clinically stable pediatric HTRs. A total of 13 clinically stable HTRs, 13 patients who had undergone cardiac surgery (CS) under cardiopulmonary bypass, and 16 healthy controls under 18 years of age were retrospectively evaluated. No significant differences were observed between the HTR, CS, and control groups in terms of QTc, JTc interval, and T wave amplitude (p&gt;0.05). The Tp-e interval (p=0.001), Tp-e/QT ratio (p&lt;0.001), and Tp-e/QTc ratio (p=0.001) were significantly higher in the HTR group compared with the CS and normal control participants. The Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QT ratio, and Tp-e/QTc ratio were elevated in stable HTRs compared with the normal and CS groups.
