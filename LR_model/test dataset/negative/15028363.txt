Glucose intolerance, as reflected by hemoglobin A1c level, is associated with the incidence and severity of transplant coronary artery disease. The possible effect of plasma hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) on the development of transplant coronary artery disease (TxCAD) was investigated. Glucose intolerance is implicated as a risk factor for TxCAD. However, a relationship between HbA(1c) and TxCAD has not been demonstrated. Plasma HbA(1c) was measured in 151 adult patients undergoing routine annual coronary angiography at a mean period of 4.1 years after heart transplantation. Intracoronary ultrasound (ICUS) was also performed in 42 patients. Transplant CAD was graded by angiography as none, mild (stenosis in any vessel < or =30%), moderate (31% to 69%), or severe (> or =70%) and was defined by ICUS as a mean intimal thickness (MIT) > or =0.3 mm in any coronary artery segment. The association between TxCAD and established risk factors was examined. Plasma HbA(1c) increased with the angiographic grade of TxCAD (5.6%, 5.8%, 6.4%, and 6.2% for none, mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively; p < 0.05 for none vs. moderate or severe) and correlated with disease severity (r = 0.24, p < 0.05). The HbA(1c) level was higher in patients with MIT > or =0.3 mm than in those with MIT <0.3 mm (6.4% vs. 5.7%, p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified HbA(1c) as an independent predictor of TxCAD, as detected by angiography or ICUS (odds ratios 1.9 and 2.4, 95% confidence intervals 1.5 to 6.3 [p = 0.010] and 1.3 to 4.2 [p < 0.005], respectively). Persistent glucose intolerance, as reflected by plasma HbA(1c), is associated with the occurrence of TxCAD and may play an important role in its pathogenesis.
