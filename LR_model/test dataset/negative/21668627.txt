Anti-complement component C5 mAb synergizes with CTLA4Ig to inhibit alloreactive T cells and prolong cardiac allograft survival in mice. While activation of serum complement mediates antibody-initiated vascular allograft injury, increasing evidence indicates that complement also functions as a modulator of alloreactive T cells. We tested whether blockade of complement activation at the C5 convertase step affects T cell-mediated cardiac allograft rejection in mice. The anti-C5 mAb BB5.1, which prevents the formation of C5a and C5b, synergized with subtherapeutic doses of CTLA4Ig to significantly prolong the survival of C57BL/6 heart grafts that were transplanted into naive BALB/c recipients. Anti-C5 mAb treatment limited the induction of donor-specific IFNÎ³-producing T cell alloimmunity without inducing Th2 or Th17 immunity in vivo and inhibited primed T cells from responding to donor antigens in secondary mixed lymphocyte responses. Additional administration of anti-C5 mAb to the donor prior to graft recovery further prolonged graft survival and concomitantly reduced both the in vivo trafficking of primed T cells into the transplanted allograft and decreased expression of T cell chemoattractant chemokines within the graft. Together these results support the novel concept that C5 blockade can inhibit T cell-mediated allograft rejection through multiple mechanisms, and suggest that C5 blockade may constitute a viable strategy to prevent and/or treat T cell-mediated allograft rejection in humans.
