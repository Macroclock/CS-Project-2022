Inflammatory cardiomyopathies: short- and long-term outcomes after heart transplantation-a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis. Heart transplantation (HTx) for patients with "giant cell myocarditis" (GCM) or "cardiac sarcoidosis" (CS) is still controversial. However, no single center has accumulated enough experience to investigate post-HTx outcome. The primary aim of this systematic review is to identify, appraise, and synthesize existing literature investigating whether patients who have undergone HTx because of GCM or CS have worse outcomes as compared with patients transplanted because of other etiologies. A systematic and comprehensive search will be performed using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Google Scholar, for studies published up to December 2019. Observational and interventional population-based studies will be eligible for inclusion. The quality of observational studies will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, while the interventional studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Effective Practice Organization of Care tool. The collected evidence will be narratively synthesized; in addition, we will perform a meta-analysis to pool estimates from studies considered to be homogenous. Reporting of the systematic review and meta-analysis will be in accordance with the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. To our knowledge, this will be the first synthesis of outcomes, including survival, acute cellular rejection, and disease recurrence, in patients with either GCM or CS treated with HTx. Reviewing the suitability of HTx in this population and highlighting areas for further research will benefit both patients and healthcare providers. Trial registration: CRD42019140574.
