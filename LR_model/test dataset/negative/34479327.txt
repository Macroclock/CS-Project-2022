[Spontaneous coronary artery dissection in a heart transplant patient. Report of one case]. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is an uncommon cause of acute coronary syndrome that predominantly affects women without cardiovascular risk factors. In transplant patients, spontaneous coronary artery dissection is an extremely rare condition, having been described in only three patients, in whom vascular damage secondary to the use of anticalcineurinics is postulated as a probable mechanism. We report a spontaneous coronary dissection in a female who received a heart transplant at 34 years of age. The diagnosis was made in a follow-up coronary angiography three years after transplantation, supplemented with optical coherence tomography. A percutaneous coronary revascularization of the involved artery was performed, with good immediate results and at one year of follow-up.
