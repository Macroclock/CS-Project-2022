Lentivirus-mediated gene transfer of viral interleukin-10 delays but does not prevent cardiac allograft rejection. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-based lentiviral vectors expressing viral interleukin-10 (vIL-10) were used to transduce rat cardiac allografts with the aim of extending graft survival. vIL-10 expression was first shown, by RT-PCR, to persist in transduced heart isografts for at least 28 days after transduction. Cardiac transplants were performed in a fully allogeneic rat strain combination (Lewis to DA); allografts transduced by vectors expressing vIL-10 showed significantly prolonged survival (14.5 vs 7.5 days median survival time). Mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs) were used to determine the influence, in vitro, of vIL-10 on alloantigen-induced T-cell proliferation. Bioactive vIL-10, produced by DA rat aortic endothelial cells transduced with HIV-PGK-vIL-10, was added to MLRs at different time points and lymphocyte proliferation was assessed by uptake of [3H]thymidine. T-cell proliferation was inhibited by >80% when vIL-10 was added to the MLR at day 1, 2 or 3 of coculture. The inhibitory effect was significantly decreased when addition of vIL-10 was delayed until day 4 or 5 (47 and 35% inhibition, respectively). The extended graft survival time is comparable to that using adenoviral vectors delivering vIL-10 in a similar rat strain combination. The limited improvement in survival may be due to lack of inhibition of the early phase of the alloimmune response as suggested by in vitro studies confirming that maximum suppression of the MLR by vIL-10 can only be achieved if the cytokine is present at the initiation of alloimmune recognition. The delay in expression of vIL-10 from the lentiviral vector means that protocols must be developed to suppress the early stages of alloimmune stimulation before vIL-10 is produced.
