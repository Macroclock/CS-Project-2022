Sustained suppression of peripheral blood immune functions by treatment with mycophenolate mofetil correlates with reduced severity of cardiac allograft rejection. We tested the hypothesis that sustained suppression of immune functions by mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) throughout the dosing interval reduces the severity of rejection. Four groups of rat heart allograft recipients were treated orally daily through Day 5 with either: "low-dose" MMF, 10 mg/kg once daily (QD) or 5 mg/kg twice daily (BID); or "high-dose" MMF, 20 mg/kg QD or 10 mg/kg BID. The following were determined for all animals on Day 6: pharmacokinetics (PK, using high-performance liquid chromatography) of mycophenolic acid (MPA); pharmacodynamics (PD, by flow cytometry quantitation of whole blood mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation and expression of diverse T-cell surface activation molecules); and histologic graft rejection scores (RS). RS correlated with PD for suppression of both lymphocyte proliferation and transferrin receptor expression (r2 = 0.85 and 0.81, respectively) more highly than with MPA plasma levels (r2 = 0.45), which shows the validity of PD as surrogate markers of MMF efficacy. MMF 5 mg/kg BID produced greater (p < 0.001) suppression of lymphocyte proliferation (area under the PD effect-time curve, AUE = 2,010% inhibition. hour) and sustained trough (E0) PD effect (86% suppression) than MMF 10 mg/kg QD (AUE = 1,436% inhibition. hour, E0 = 55%). RS did not differ between the 20 mg/kg QD and 10 mg/kg BID "high-dose" groups, because PD was maximally suppressed. PD were surrogate markers for MMF immunosuppressive efficacy. MMF 5 mg/kg BID produced more sustained suppression of both PD and rejection than MMF 10 mg/kg QD.
