Activation of autoimmune B cells and chronic rejection. Allotransplantation into immunosuppressed individuals results in long-term survival of grafts. However, the grafts are damaged, probably at many stages before, during and after implantation. The hypothesis to be presented is that release of antigens and autoantigens from the chronically damaged graft results in breaking tolerance to self-antigens and an autoimmune response. There is experimental evidence that autoimmune responses following allotransplantation are damaging and cause accelerated graft rejection.
