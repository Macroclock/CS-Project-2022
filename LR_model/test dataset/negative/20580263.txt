Cardiomyocyte-targeted HIF-1alpha gene therapy inhibits cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac allograft vasculopathy in the rat. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a key transcription factor in hypoxia, affects a wide range of adaptive cell functions. We examined the kinetics of endogenous HIF-1alpha during acute and chronic rejection, and the effect of exogenous HIF-1alpha in chronically rejecting rat cardiac allografts. Heterotopic cardiac transplantations were performed between major MHC-mismatched Dark Agouti and Wistar-Furth rats. Cyclosporine A (CsA) was used to prevent acute rejection in the chronic rejection model. The effect of HIF-1alpha overexpression was investigated by adeno-assocated virus 2 (AAV2)-mediated gene transfer of a constitutively stabilized form of mouse HIF-1alpha (AAV-HIF-1alpha). The analysis of allografts was based on histology, immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Acute and chronic rejection significantly induced HIF-1alpha mRNA in rat cardiac allografts when compared with syngeneic controls. Immunohistochemistry localized significantly increased HIF-1alpha immunoreactivity to vascular smooth muscle cells, vascular endothelial cells, post-capillary venules and graft-infiltrating mononuclear inflammatory cells of the allograft, whereas expression in cardiomyocytes remained unchanged. Regression analysis revealed a linear correlation between the progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) and HIF-1alpha immunoreactivity in post-capillary venules and graft-infiltrating mononuclear inflammatory cells in chronically rejecting rat cardiac allografts. AAV-HIF-1alpha enhanced cardiomyocyte HIF-1alpha production and significantly reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and the development of CAV in chronically rejecting rat cardiac allografts. We found that acute and chronic rejection increased HIF-1alpha mRNA and protein levels in rat cardiac allografts. On the other hand, cardiomyocyte-targeted HIF-1alpha gene transfer inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis and the development of CAV, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for HIF-1alpha in cardiac allografts.
