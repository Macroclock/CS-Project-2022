Germinal Center Alloantibody Responses Mediate Progression of Chronic Allograft Injury. Different profiles of alloantibody responses are observed in the clinic, with those that persist, often despite targeted treatment, associated with poorer long-term transplant outcomes. Although such responses would suggest an underlying germinal center (GC) response, the relationship to cellular events within the allospecific B cell population is unclear. Here we examine the contribution of germinal center (GC) humoral alloimmunity to chronic antibody mediated rejection (AMR). A murine model of chronic AMR was developed in which T cell deficient ( 'allograft', 'extrafollicular B cell response', 'germinal center (GC)', 'humoral allograft rejection', 'transplantation'
