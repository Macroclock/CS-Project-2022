Usefulness of B-type natriuretic peptide levels in predicting hemodynamic perturbations after heart transplantation despite preserved left ventricular systolic function. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the association of peripheral B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels with clinical symptoms and central hemodynamic and echocardiographic measures in cardiac transplantation. BNP reflects ventricular wall stress and correlates with severity of heart failure. No previous investigation has comprehensively assessed the rapid bedside BNP assay for predicting hemodynamic measures of cardiac allograft function in heart transplantation. We evaluated BNP levels using a rapid point-of-care assay in 87 stable cardiac transplant recipients who had 237 consecutive measurements along with endomyocardial biopsy, right-sided cardiac catheterization, and echocardiography. Using median tendencies, 2 groups were identified: the low BNP group (n = 116, BNP <150 pg/ml) and the high BNP group (n = 121, BNP >/=150 pg/ml). The high BNP group had increased right atrial pressures, higher pulmonary artery systolic pressures, pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and lower cardiac index. Besides hemodynamic variables, the presence of right ventricular dysfunction (p = 0.05) and significant tricuspid regurgitation (p = 0.003) were associated with higher BNP levels. Independent predictors of BNP levels on multivariate analysis included elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, lower cardiac index, and symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue. This initial investigation establishes the accuracy of a point-of-care BNP assay in predicting cardiopulmonary hemodynamic aberrations despite preserved left ventricular systolic function in heart transplant recipients. Rapid bedside BNP analysis may provide a noninvasive surrogate method for the comprehensive assessment of cardiac allograft function and hemodynamics in heart transplantation.
