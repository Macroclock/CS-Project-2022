Pravastatin therapy is associated with reduction in coronary allograft vasculopathy in pediatric heart transplantation. Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of developing coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) following heart transplantation in adults and are used routinely in many centers. CAV and lipid abnormalities have been reported to be less prevalent in pediatric heart transplant recipients. It is not known whether statins reduce the risk of CAV in this population A retrospective review was performed to analyze the risk factors for developing CAV following pediatric heart transplantation with particular attention to the impact of pravastatin therapy. The study population was comprised of 129 pediatric patients who underwent 142 heart transplants at our institution from 1988 to 2003. The outcome variable was freedom from CAV, CAV being determined by coronary angiography or autopsy. CAV was identified in 25 recipients at a median of 3.7 years after transplantation. There were 331 patient-years of pravastatin therapy. Pravastatin therapy resulted in a reduction in total cholesterol levels, 162 +/- 29 to 137 +/- 20 mg/dl, p = 0.01. In multivariate analysis the use of pravastatin was associated with a lower incidence of CAV (p = 0.03), whereas an increased frequency of late rejection (p = 0.003) and earlier year of transplantation (p = 0.04) were associated with increased risk of CAV. The routine use of pravastatin was associated with a lower risk following pediatric heart transplantation. Further studies into the relationship between lipid abnormalities, inflammation and rejection, and the development of CAV in children are warranted.
