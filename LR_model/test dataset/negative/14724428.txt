Programmed death-1-programmed death-L1 interaction is essential for induction of regulatory cells by intratracheal delivery of alloantigen. Programmed death (PD)-1 has been implicated in peripheral tolerance. The authors investigated the roles of PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, in the induction of regulatory cells by intratracheal delivery of alloantigen. CBA (H-2k) mice were pretreated with intratracheal delivery of C57BL/10 (H-2b) splenocytes and administration of monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2. Seven days later, C57BL/10 hearts were transplanted into the pretreated CBA mice. Some naive CBA mice underwent adoptive transfer of splenocytes from the pretreated CBA mice and transplantation of C57BL/10 heart. Untreated CBA mice rejected C57BL/10 cardiac grafts acutely (median survival time [MST], 7 days). Pretreatment with intratracheal delivery of C57BL/10 splenocytes prolonged graft survival significantly (MST, 65 days). Administration of control immunoglobulin (Ig) G or anti-PD-L2 mAb did not significantly affect the prolongation (MST, 72 and 68 days, respectively). In contrast, anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 mAb abrogated the prolongation (MST, 18 and 17 days, respectively). Adoptive transfer from mice pretreated with intratracheal delivery of alloantigen plus control IgG or anti-PD-L2 mAb prolonged survival of C57BL/10 grafts in secondary CBA recipients (MST, 72 and 56 days, respectively). However, concurrent administration of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 mAb abrogated prolonged survival after the adoptive transfer (MST, 14 and 20 days, respectively). PD-1-PD-L1 interaction was essential for induction of regulatory cells by intratracheal delivery of alloantigen.
