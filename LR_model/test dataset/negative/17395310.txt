The effect of functional performance, respiratory function and osteopenia on the quality of life after heart transplantation. To determine the effect of functional performance, respiratory function, and osteopenia on the quality of life after heart transplantation. Thirty-one patients were included. Functional performance (peak oxygen consumption - pVO2), respiratory function, quality of life (the short form 36 - SF36) and lumbar spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD) were performed. There was a significant relationship between pVO2 and physical function and the physical role scores on the SF36 (p<0.05). Additionally, a significant relationship was found between the scores on the respiratory function tests and the physical and social function scores on the SF36 (p<0.05). There was no significant relationship found between osteopenia and SF36 scores (p>0.05).
