Left Ventricular Assist Device as Destination Therapy: a State of the Science and Art of Long-Term Mechanical Circulatory Support. The purpose of this review is to synthesize and summarize recent developments in the care of patients with end-stage heart failure being managed with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as destination therapy. Although the survival of patients treated with LVAD continues to improve, the rates of LVAD-associated complication, such as right ventricular failure, bleeding complications, and major infection, remain high, and management of these patients remains challenging. The durability and hemocompatibility of LVAD support have greatly increased in recent years as a result of new technologies and novel management strategies. Challenges remain in the comprehensive care of patients with destination therapy LVADs, including management of comorbidities and optimizing patient function and quality of life.
