Elevated AT1R Antibody and Morbidity in Patients Bridged to Heart Transplant Using Continuous Flow Left Ventricular Assist Devices. We studied longitudinal levels of angiotensin-II type 1 receptor antibody (AT1R-Ab) and their effects on adverse events (death, treated rejection and cardiac allograft vasculopathy) in patients who were bridged to heart transplant using a continuous flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Sera of 77 patients bridged to heart transplant (from 2009 to 2017) were tested for AT1R-Ab and CRP before and after LVAD. Elevated AT1R-Ab was defined as >10.0 U/mL. The median follow-up after transplant was 3.6 years (interquartile range, 2.2-5.6 years). After LVAD, AT1R-Ab levels increased from baseline and remained elevated until transplant. Freedom from adverse events at 5 years was lower in those with elevated AT1R-Ab levels at time of transplant. In an adjusted, multivariable Cox analysis, an AT1R-Ab level of >10 U/mL was associated with developing the primary end point (adjusted hazard ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.2-9.2, P = .017). Although C-reactive protein levels were high before and after LVAD placement, C-reactive protein did not correlate with AT1R-Ab. In LVAD patients bridged to heart transplant, an increased AT1R-Ab level at time of transplant was associated with poor outcomes after heart transplant. Post-LVAD AT1R-Ab elevations were not correlated with serum markers of systemic inflammation. Larger studies are needed to examine the pathologic role of AT1R-Ab in heart transplant.
