Bariatric surgery in patients with left ventricular assist devices: a safe and effective method of weight loss as a gateway to heart transplantation. Severe cardiac disease often warrants intervention to improve cardiac function, such as mechanical support via a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). While this is an effective way of improving myocardial activity, it works synergistically with weight loss. Academic hospital. The aim of this study was to evaluate bariatric surgery as an alternative means of weight loss to improve cardiac status. Six patients with LVADs underwent sleeve gastrectomies (SG) over a 5-year study period (2014-2018). Patient characteristics, cardiac history, operative outcomes, and follow-up was evaluated by univariate analyses. Median age at operation was 49.8 years (range, 24-58 yr) with average weight at surgery of 126.6 kg. Average body mass index at time of SG was 41.4 kg/m We demonstrate that weight loss surgery as a bridge to transplantation for patients with implanted LVADs can be performed in young and middle-aged adults. Although it is limited by sample size, the reported results add to the existing literature highlighting the potential success of bariatric surgery in high-risk patient populations to achieve weight loss goals, impact cardiac co-morbidities, and improve overall quality of life.
