Ablation of interferon regulatory factor 4 in T cells induces "memory" of transplant tolerance that is irreversible by immune checkpoint blockade. Achieving transplant tolerance remains the ultimate goal in the field of organ transplantation. We demonstrated previously that ablation of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) in T cells induced heart transplant acceptance by driving allogeneic CD4 'T cell biology', 'animal models: murine', 'basic (laboratory) research/science', 'cellular biology', 'graft survival', 'immunobiology', 'organ transplantation in general', 'tolerance'
