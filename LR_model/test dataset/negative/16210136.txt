Microsatellite polymorphism in the heme oxygenase-1 gene promoter and cardiac allograft vasculopathy. The heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) isoenzyme has recently been suggested to protect transplants from ischemia-reperfusion and immunologic injury. Inducibility of this enzyme is modulated by a (GT)n dinucleotide length polymorphism in the HO-1 gene promoter. Short (class S) repeats are associated with greater up-regulation of HO-1 than are long repeats. In the present study, we investigated the impact of the promoter polymorphism on the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) in human heart transplants. We enrolled 152 recipients of a heart allograft with at least 1 year survival post-transplantation in this retrospective study. The HO-1 genotype was assessed using genomic DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded allograft biopsy specimens. Patients were followed angiographically for CAV. Angiographic vessel-wall abnormalities were defined as CAV, and a stenosis of more than 50% in at least 1 vessel area was defined as severe CAV. Eighty-seven patients (57%) had received a heart from a donor with at least 1 class S allele. Within the mean follow-up period of 9 years, 95 patients (63%) showed signs of CAV, among which 60 patients (40%) developed severe CAV. The frequency of CAV and severe CAV was not significantly different between class S allele recipients and non-recipients (CAV, 57/87 vs 38/65, p = 0.12; severe CAV, 35/87 vs 25/65, p = 0.30). In contrast to recent findings in renal allografts and vascular injury, the HO-1 gene promoter polymorphism does not show an association with the development of CAV in heart transplants.
