Monotherapy with tacrolimus for heart and liver transplant: a case report. Multiple-organ transplantation cases are rare, partly due to the shortage of donor organs. However, recent reports of outcomes of multiple-organ transplantations show encouraging survival rates for recipients as compared to single-organ transplant recipients. A 33-year-old female who was a known hepatitis B carrier and who had been diagnosed with peripartum dilated cardiomyopathy was experiencing end-stage heart failure. The patient received orthotopic heart transplantation. After heart transplantation, the recipient received prednisolone, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil for immunosuppressive therapy. Seventy-one days later, the recipient began to develop progressive jaundice, ascites, and hepatoencephalopathy and was re-admitted to the hospital. Fulminant hepatitis was diagnosed. She was referred for emergency cadaveric liver transplantation 110 days after the heart transplantation because of her critical condition. After transplantation, she was improved and her condition maintained by a single immunosuppressive therapy, tacrolimus, with mean dose of 0.06 mg/kg/d. We presented a case that was complicated by fulminant hepatitis after heart transplantation and successfully rescued by liver transplantation.
