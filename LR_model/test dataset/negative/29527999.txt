Prevalence and Angiographic Characteristics of Coronary Vasospasm Detected at Surveillance Coronary Angiograms Among Patients With Heart Transplants. Coronary vasospasm in heart transplant recipients occurs through various mechanisms. It has been linked to allograft rejection and coronary vasculopathy, which can result in mortality during follow-up. Here, we investigated the prevalence of coronary vasospasm among heart transplant recipients undergoing surveillance coronary angiography procedures. This study was prospectively performed at Ba≈ükent University Faculty of Medicine by retrospectively analyzing medical information of patients who underwent bicaval heart transplant between 2003 and 2016 and subsequently had coronary angiography to rule out allograft vasculopathy. We analyzed prevalence of coronary vasospasm, affected vessels, underlying vessel properties, and treatment modalities. Coronary vasospasm was defined as transient diffuse or localized luminal narrowing, either spontaneously or catheter-induced, relieved spontaneously or with nitroglycerine. Forty-one coronary angiography procedures were performed using the standard Judkins technique. Among these, 5 patients showed coronary vasospasm a mean of 2 years after cardiac transplant. All vasospasm episodes involved the left anterior descending artery, with 2 also involving the circumflex artery and 1 involving the right coronary artery. The degree of luminal narrowing ranged from mild to severe. Episodes that involved the left anterior descending artery more often diffusely involved most of the vessel. In 3 patients, vasospasms were recurrent. Three patients had underlying coronary artery disease, which was relieved in 2 patients who progressed by stent implant. Neither ischemic events nor reduction of ejection fraction was observed during follow-up. There were also no occurrences of cellular or humoral rejection or death in any of the patients with vasospasm. Coronary vasospasm is common in heart transplant recipients. It may be diffuse or localized and occur spontaneously or because of underlying coronary artery disease. Factors, including allograft vasculopathy, associated with coronary vasospasm remain to be determined, and further related research is needed.
