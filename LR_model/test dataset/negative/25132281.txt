Long-term right ventricular support with a centrifugal ventricular assist device placed in the right atrium. This case series outlines the technique and results of right ventricular assist device (RVAD) support with the off-label use of the centrifugal HeartWare HVAD (HeartWare Inc., Framingham, MA, USA) for long-term support. Four patients in our institution have been implanted with BiVADs, using the Heartware device as the RVAD, and supported for between 117 days and 772 days. Three of the patients have been successfully supported for over 18 months. Three patients have successfully been transplanted and one patient remains on the device, now approaching two years of support. None of the patients have had RVAD device-related complications.
