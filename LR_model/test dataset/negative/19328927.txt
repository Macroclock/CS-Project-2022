An 11-Year Overview of the Belgian Donor and Transplant Statistics Based on a Consecutive Yearly Data Follow-up and Comparing Two Periods: 1997 to 2005 Versus 2006 to 2007. The Belgian Transplant Coordinators Section is responsible for the yearly data follow-up concerning donor and transplantation statistics in Belgium and presents herein a 10-year overview. The procurement and transplant statistics were compared between 2 periods: Period 1 (P1, 1997-2005) versus Period 2 (P2, 2006-2007). The kidney and liver waiting lists (P1 vs P2) showed an overall decrease for a period of 2 consecutive years in P2; kidney (-170 patients; -18%), and liver (-83 patients; -34%). All other waiting lists (heart, lung, pancreas) remained stable. Mean ED further increased (P1 vs P2); 229 (P1) versus 280 (P2, +22.27%). Non-heart-beating donors were significantly (+288%) more often procured in P2. Mean donor age was 37.9 +/- 17.8 years (P1) versus 46.5 +/- 19.9 years (P2), and mean organ yield per donor was 3.48 +/- 1.7 (P1) versus 3.38 +/- 1.8 (P2). Overall transplant activity per million inhabitants increased 21.1%. For 2 consecutive years, the Belgian statistics showed significantly increased donor activity with an impact on waiting list dynamics and transplantation. The mean organ yield per donor was not influenced despite an increased average age and change in reason for death.
