A Novel Extracorporeal Continuous-Flow Ventricular Assist System for Patients With Advanced Heart Failure　- Initial Clinical Experience. Bridge-to-decision (BTD) devices providing temporary mechanical circulatory support should be introduced to patients with advanced heart failure. This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of a BTD device comprising an innovative extracorporeal continuous-flow temporary ventricular assist device (VAD) driven by a novel hydrodynamically levitated centrifugal flow blood pump.Methods and Results:Nine patients, comprising 3 with dilated cardiomyopathy, 3 with fulminant myocarditis, and 3 with ischemic heart disease, and 6 males, whose mean age was 47.7±8.1 years, were enrolled into the study. Six patients had Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support profile 1, and 3 were profile 2. The primary endpoint was a composite of survival free from device-related serious adverse events and complications during circulatory support. Eight patients received left ventricular support, of whom 3 received concomitant right ventricular support using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuits, as a consequence of severe respiratory failure. One patient with fulminant myocarditis received biventricular support using the novel VAD system. After 19.0±13.5 days, 3 patients were weaned from circulatory support, because their native cardiac function recovered, and 6 patients required conversion to a durable device as a bridge-to-transplantation. One patient had non-disabling ischemic stroke episodes, and no patients died. This novel extracorporeal VAD system with a hydrodynamically levitated centrifugal pump can safely and successfully bridge patients with advanced heart failure to subsequent therapeutic stages.
