[Phase III rehabilitation after heart transplantation]. Longterm treatment after heart transplantation (HTX) improves survival, although the quality of life and exercise tolerance decreased continuously between one and ten years after transplantation. The role of physical exercise and psychological support in longterm treatment after HTX has not been determined. We analyzed the effects of a one year outpatient rehabilitation program in combination with a home based, computer assisted training program on exercise capacity, coronary risk factors and quality of life. 20 heart transplant recipients in an intervention group and 12 patients after HTX in a control group participated in the study (IG (CG); 5.1+/-2.2 (4.5+/-2.3) years after HTX; age: 55+/-7 (54+/-8) years; body mass index: 28.3+/-1.0 (28.7+/-0.9) kg.m(-2)). Before and after the intervention, maximum and constant load exercise capacity, and self-reported quality of life were evaluated. The 12 month intervention period included 10 days of exercise testing as well as medical and psychological support. Furthermore, the IG group performed a computer-assisted and controlled home ergometer training every second day. After one year with 114+/-18 exercise training sessions, maximum oxygen consumption increased in the IG from 18.8+/-4.2 to 20.1+/-4.2 ml.min(-1).kg(-1) (p<0.05; CG 19.3+/- 4.5 to 18.5+/-2.8 ml.min(- 1).kg(-1); p<0.01 IG vs CG). In the IG, lower back pain, body fat, and blood pressure were all reduced, while the self-reported quality of life, endurance exercise capacity and HDL cholesterol were increased. No significant changes occurred in the control group. When initiated years after heart transplantation, longterm rehabilitation reduced coronary risk factors and significantly improved both the subjects' quality of life, as well as a near to normal capacity for physical work.
