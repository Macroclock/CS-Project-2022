A decade of percutaneous coronary interventions in cardiac transplant recipients: a monocentric study in 160 patients. Transplant vasculopathy is a long-term complication of cardiac transplantation. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PCI) is a method of choice for local revascularization that is also increasingly used in heart transplant patients. Between October 1989 and November 2006, 160 adult cardiac transplant recipients (19 women) with mean age at heart transplantation of 47 +/- 12 years underwent PCI in 502 coronary segments during 319 catheterizations (balloon only, 209; bare metal stents, 227, drug-eluting stents, 66). Concomitant medical therapy, procedural data, primary success, recurrence of stenosis, and cardiac events (cardiac death or repeat transplantation) were analyzed retrospectively. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed. Stents reduced early and mid-term recurrence of stenosis but had no impact on graft survival. Drug-eluting stents did not improve the restenosis rate. Immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil and concomitant treatment with statins and clopidogrel were significantly associated with reduced recurrence of stenosis and prolonged graft survival. Low steroid dosage was associated with a positive impact on graft survival. Stenting in heart transplant patients has no impact on graft survival despite high primary success and deferred recurrence of stenosis. Early reduction of steroids, immunosuppression by mycophenolate mofetil, and concomitant treatment with statins are likely to reduce recurrent stenosis and to improve graft survival in heart transplant patients needing PCI. Long-term treatment with clopidogrel deserves further assessment.
