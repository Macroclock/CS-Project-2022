Prevalence and characterization of frailty, depression, and cognitive impairment in patients listed for heart transplantation: Results of the FELICITAR prospective registry. It is recommended to assess frailty prior to heart transplantation (HT). Our objective was to assess the prevalence of frailty in patients listed for HT. The FELICITAR registry (Frailty Evaluation after List Inclusion, Characteristics and Influence on TrAnsplantation And Results) is a prospective registry that includes patients listed for HT in three centers, from January 2017 to April 2019. We assessed the presence of frailty, depression, cognitive impairment, and quality of life when included. Ninety-nine patients were included. Of this group, 30.6% were frail, 55 (56.1%) had depression (treated only in nine patients), and 51 (54.8%) had cognitive impairment. Compared with non-frail patients, frail patients were more frequently hospitalized when included in HT waiting list (P = .048), had a lower upper-arm circumference (P = .026), had a lower Barthel index (P = .001), more anemia (P = .010), higher rates of depression (P = .001), poorer quality of life (P = .001), and lower hand-grip strength (P < .001). In multivariate analysis hand-grip strength (odds ratio .91; 95% confidence interval .87-.96, P < .001) and Barthel index (odds ratio .90; 95% confidence interval .82-.99, P = .024) were associated with frailty. Frailty, depression, and cognitive impairment are common in patients included in HT waiting list. Frailty is strongly associated with hand-grip strength.
