Pregnancy outcomes in pulmonary arterial hypertension in the modern management era. Previous studies have reported mortality rates of up to 56% associated with pregnancy in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) but the management of this disease has changed considerably in recent years. We compiled a multinational, prospective registry to examine the contemporary outcome of pregnancies in patients with PAH. During a 3-yr period, the 13 participating centres reported 26 pregnancies. Three (12%) females died and one (4%) developed right heart failure requiring urgent heart-lung transplantation. There were eight abortions; two spontaneous and six induced. 16 (62%) pregnancies were successful, i.e. the females delivered healthy babies without complications. These females had well controlled PAH (pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) 500 ± 352 dyn·s·cm(-5)); eight of them were long-term responders to calcium channel blockers. In contrast, the females who died or required transplantation had poorly controlled PAH (PVR 1,667 ± 209 dyn·s·cm(-5)). Pregnancy remains associated with a substantial mortality rate in PAH. However, our results indicate that the outcome of pregnancy in PAH has improved, at least when PAH is well controlled, and particularly in long-term responders to calcium channel blockers. These data must be confirmed by larger series before the general recommendation to avoid pregnancy in all patients with PAH is reconsidered.
