Bibliometric Analysis of the Top 100 Most Cited Articles in the First 50 Years of Heart Transplantation. The world celebrates over 50 years since the first human-to-human heart transplant. Bibliometric analysis is a statistical concept that has recently evolved, enabling scientists to study citation patterns and identify characteristics of highly cited scholarly work in different fields. Although it has been widely utilized, such analyses have not been conducted to date on heart transplant literature. We sought to assess the characteristics of the top 100 most referenced citations in the field of heart transplantation. We searched the Scopus database (www.scopus.com) to identify all articles relating to heart transplantation. The articles were arranged in descending order from most cited to least cited and selected articles were scrutinized for data extraction. One hundred articles were included in the final list. Of the total 40,660 citations identified, 3,210 (8.0%) were self-citations, which impacted the final rank order. The articles were published in 25 different journals between 1960 and 2013. The most productive 5-year time period was between 2000 and 2005, when 24 of the 100 most cited publications were produced. There was no correlation between the journals' impact factors and the number of articles produced per journal. The presence and type of funding were not associated with the number of citations. Over 85% of first and senior investigators were men. In conclusion, our study highlights key features of the most highly cited scientific literature on heart transplantation and provides insights into trends of published work in this field. Additionally, this work may serve as a useful guide to researchers and funding bodies by highlighting the most prolific areas of cardiac transplant research to date.
