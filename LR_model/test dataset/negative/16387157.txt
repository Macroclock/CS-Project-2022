Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome associated with left ventricular assist device. Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLES), previously known as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), is characterized by the presence of bilateral lesions located within the posterior border zones of the cerebral hemisphere and cerebellum. This condition commonly presents with headache, nausea, vomiting, decreased vision and level of consciousness, and seizures. RPLES has been associated with hypertensive encephalopathy, eclampsia, renal failure, and immunosuppressive therapy following transplant. We report the development of RPLES in a boy following implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). To our knowledge, this is the first report of RPLES in association with the use of LVAD.
