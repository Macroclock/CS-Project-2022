Modified Bicaval Technique in Orthotopic Heart Transplantation　- Comparison With Conventional Bicaval Technique. Orthotopic heart transplantation (HT) is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage heart failure (HF). The bicaval technique was introduced as a safe alternative minimizing modification of atrial geometry. The modification of bicaval anastomosis is suggested to compensate for caliber mismatch and small donor. The present study was performed to compare these 2 techniques in terms of postoperative CT scan and clinical outcomes. Methods and Results: Retrospectively, 158 consecutive patients with end-stage HF underwent orthotopic HT between January 2009 and June 2013 were analyzed. Of these, we excluded 3 patients with total HT. The study group was divided into modified technique (n=37) or conventional technique (n=118). A total of 113 patients (modified: n=29, conventional: n=84) were examined with cardiac CT. Discrepancy in the size of the vena cava compared with that of the anastomosis site was assessed. There was no significant difference in the complication and survival rates. There was 1 incident of moderate-to-severe tricuspid valve regurgitation in the modified group (n=1, 2.7%). Both the SVC ratio (1.07±0.13 vs. 1.28±0.32, P=0.001) and IVC ratio (1.06±0.07 vs. 1.13±0.19, P=0.009) were higher in the conventional group, which meant more stenotic imaging findings were observed in the conventional group. Orthotopic HT with modified bicaval anastomosis is an attractive alternative with easy orientation and equivocal outcomes. 'Caval anastomosis', 'Heart failure', 'Heart transplantation'
