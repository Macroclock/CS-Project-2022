Angiopoietin-1 protects against the development of cardiac allograft arteriosclerosis. Angiopoietin (Ang)-1 is an angiogenic growth factor that counteracts the permeability and proinflammatory effects of vascular endothelial growth factor and other proinflammatory cytokines. Recently, we demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor enhances cardiac allograft arteriosclerosis. Here, we studied the roles of Ang1, its natural antagonist Ang2, and their receptor Tie2 in rat cardiac allograft arteriosclerosis. Heterotopic cardiac allografts and syngrafts were transplanted from Dark Agouti (DA) to Wistar-Furth rats and from DA to DA rats, respectively. Immunohistochemistry disclosed that only a few mesenchymal cells expressed Ang1 in normal hearts and syngrafts, whereas no immunoreactivity was found in cardiac allografts undergoing chronic rejection. Ang2 and Tie2 immunoreactivity was induced mainly in capillaries and postcapillary venules in chronic allografts when compared with syngeneic controls, but no immunoreactivity was found in arterial endothelium. Intracoronary perfusion of cardiac allografts with a clinical-grade adenoviral vector encoding human Ang1 (Ad.Ang1) protected against the development of allograft arteriosclerosis. Ad.Ang1 perfusion reduced Ang2 expression in microcirculation, the numbers of graft-infiltrating leukocytes, and the level of immunoactivation and interstitial fibrosis, as well as both the incidence and intensity of intimal lesions. Ad.Ang1 perfusion also increased CD34+ stem cell counts in peripheral blood. Our findings suggest that the antiinflammatory properties of Ang1 may offer an entirely new therapeutic approach to prevent cardiac allograft arteriosclerosis.
