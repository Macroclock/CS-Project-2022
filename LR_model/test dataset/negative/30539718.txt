Heart Transplantation Cost Composition in Brazil: A Patient-Level Microcosting Analysis and Comparison With International Data. Advanced heart failure (HF) therapies, such as heart transplantation, are resource intensive and costly. In Brazil, only one-fifth of the estimated population need is fulfilled. We examined cost expenditures of heart transplants in a public institution in Brazil. We used microcosting analysis (time-driven activity-based costing) to examine total costs and individual cost components related to the index transplant hospital admission of all consecutive heart transplant recipients at a single center from July 2015 to June 2017. Average total cost for the 27 patients included was US$ 74,341 which exceeds the reimbursement value per patient by 60%. Major cost drivers were hospital structure and personnel, similarly to what is observed in the United States (US) and other developed countries. Total costs for index transplant admission were âˆ¼50% lower than in the US, but approximate to values reported in some European countries. Costs of heart transplantation in Brazil were lower than those reported for developed countries, and higher than national reimbursement values. Advanced microcosting methodologies represent an important quality contribution to economic studies in health care and may provide insights for transplant-related health care policies in developing countries.
