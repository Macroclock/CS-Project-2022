Angiographic regression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy after introducing sirolimus immunosuppression. We describe a 33-year-old heart transplant recipient who experienced several episodes of early Grade IIIA rejection and aggressive allograft vasculopathy, seen with serial coronary angiography. Two years after transplantation, we added sirolimus therapy to the patient's immunosuppressive regimen, and a further coronary angiogram 1 year later showed regression of the graft vasculopathy.
