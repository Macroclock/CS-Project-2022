Type B aortic dissection triggered by heart transplantation in a patient with Marfan syndrome. Heart transplantation in patients with Marfan syndrome is challenging and raises concerns with regards to the haemodynamic and immunosuppressive-induced effects on the inherently fragile aorta. Most aortic events following transplantation reported so far in the literature occurred in patients with pre-existent distal aortic dissection. We report a case of successful orthotopic heart transplantation in a patient with Marfan syndrome that was complicated by late-onset type B dissection in pre-existing mild and stable distal aortic dilation. Serial aortic imaging revealed progressive growth at the level of the descending thoracic aorta. An open thoracoabdominal aortic repair procedure was successfully performed 6 months after the transplantation.
