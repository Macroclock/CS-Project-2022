Regulatory T Cells Promote Natural Killer Cell Education in Mixed Chimeras. Therapeutic administration of regulatory T cells (Tregs) leads to engraftment of conventional doses of allogeneic bone marrow (BM) in nonirradiated recipient mice conditioned with costimulation blockade and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition. The mode of action responsible for this Treg effect is poorly understood but may encompass the control of costimulation blockade-resistant natural killer (NK) cells. We show that transient NK cell depletion at the time of BM transplantation led to BM engraftment and persistent chimerism without Treg transfer but failed to induce skin graft tolerance. In contrast, the permanent absence of anti-donor NK reactivity in mice grafted with F1 BM was associated with both chimerism and tolerance comparable to Treg therapy, implying that NK cell tolerization is a critical mechanism of Treg therapy. Indeed, NK cells of Treg-treated BM recipients reshaped their receptor repertoire in the presence of donor MHC in a manner suggesting attenuated donor reactivity. These results indicate that adoptively transferred Tregs prevent BM rejection, at least in part, by suppressing NK cells and promote tolerance by regulating the appearance of NK cells expressing activating receptors to donor class I MHC.
