Is biopsy-proven cellular rejection an important clinical consideration in heart transplantation? Immunosuppression strategies to prevent allograft rejection represent the cornerstone of long-term survival after heart transplantation. Endomyocardial biopsy has defined rejection in clinical cardiac transplantation and established a threshold for therapy. With the development of more effective immunosuppression modalities and the asymptomatic nature of most histologic rejection episodes, controversy exists regarding the need to augment immunosuppression based purely on histologic findings. The frequency of histologic rejection has declined with current immunosuppression. Resolution of lower grades of histologic rejection without treatment is the norm in both pediatric and adult heart transplant studies. Recurrent rejection episodes have been linked to the subsequent development of allograft coronary artery disease, and late rejection (even if asymptomatic) is associated with decreased survival in pediatric heart transplant recipients. Black race is a risk factor for recurrent rejection and reduced survival after late cellular rejection. Apoptosis of inflammatory cells is more evident during and after histologic rejection treated with corticosteroids. Despite numerous noninvasive modalities evaluated for the detection of rejection, to date noninvasive methods cannot reliably predict histologic rejection. Histologic rejection appears less common with current immunosuppressive strategies, and controversy exists about the need to treat asymptomatic rejection. It remains unproven whether non-treatment of moderate or greater rejection (>/=3A) increases the likelihood of recurrent rejection, which if present, may increase the risk of allograft coronary disease and/or reduced long-term survival.
