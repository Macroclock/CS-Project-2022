Combination antifungal therapy for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in a heart transplant recipient. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a severe complication after solid organ transplant, with a high mortality rate. We present a 45-year-old male heart transplant recipient who developed fever, progressive worsening of dyspnea, and productive cough without response to antibiotics. Diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was made based on clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings. The patient was treated successfully with combined antifungal therapy (voriconazole and micafungin). This case report highlights the importance of a high degree of clinical suspicion to allow curative treatment of invasive aspergillosis and the efficiency of new antifungal drugs.
