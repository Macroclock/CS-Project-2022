The Lebanese left ventricular assist device experience, a success story despite the odds. Heart failure is still a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Assist devices are reserved for advanced heart failure patients with no other therapeutic options. We aim in this paper to describe the characteristics and outcome of Lebanese left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients. From 2010 till December 2019, 78 patients were implanted with assist devices at the Beirut cardiac Institute, 82 pumps were used. To the most recent follow up after 10 years, 26 patients died (34%). 24 patients of 35 (68%) survived more than 5 years. Seven patients only (9%) died during one month of surgery. One year mortality was 19% (15 patients). The leading cause of early mortality was infection, whereas cerebrovascular accidents CVA were the leading cause of late mortality. Pump thrombosis occurred in 12% of the cases. The most serious long term complication was haemorrhagic CVA. Only seven patients (9%) received heart transplantation, with a mean time on support prior to transplantation of 1303 ± 213 days. In this manuscript we reported the characteristics and outcome of the largest population of LVAD patients in Lebanon. The survival rate was 81% at one year. These findings were comparable to the international registries except for rates of heart transplantation. More efforts should be made to encourage organ donation in Lebanon.
