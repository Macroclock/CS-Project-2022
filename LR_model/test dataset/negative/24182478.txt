Transcatheter aortic valve implantation for degenerative aortic valve regurgitation long after heart transplantation. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become a feasible therapeutic option for the management of high-risk patients with severe degenerative aortic stenosis. Recently it has been extended to high-risk patients with severe aortic regurgitation. Degenerative aortic valve disease is generally uncommon in heart transplant recipients. We report the case of a 75-year-old man in whom severe degenerative aortic regurgitation developed 14 years after heart transplantation (HTx). Because of multiple comorbidities and high surgical risk, TAVI was preferred. A 29-mm CoreValve prosthesis (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, MN) was successfully implanted using a transfemoral approach.
