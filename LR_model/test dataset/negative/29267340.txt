Clinical predictors of outcome in patients with inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy. The study objectives were to identify predictors of outcome in patients with inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMi). From 2004 to 2008, 55 patients with biopsy-proven DCMi were identified and followed up for 58.2Â±19.8 months. Predictors of outcome were identified in a multivariable analysis with a Cox proportional hazards analysis. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, heart transplantation and hospitalization for heart failure or ventricular arrhythmias. For the primary endpoint, a QTc interval >440msec (HR 2.84; 95% CI 1.03-7.87; p = 0.044), a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60ml/min/1.73m2 (HR 3.19; 95% CI 1.35-7.51; p = 0.008) and worsening of NYHA classification during follow-up (HR 2.48; 95% CI 1.01-6.10; p = 0.048) were univariate predictors, whereas left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline, NYHA class at entry, atrial fibrillation, treatment with digitalis or viral genome detection were not significantly related to outcome. After multivariable analysis, a GFR <60ml/min/1.73m2 (HR 3.04; 95% CI 1.21-7.66; p = 0.018) remained a predictor of adverse outcome. In patients with DCMi, a prolonged QTc interval >440msec, a GFR<60ml/min/1.73m2 and worsening of NYHA classification during follow-up were univariate predictors of adverse prognosis. In contrast, NYHA classification at baseline, left ventricular ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation, treatment with digitalis or viral genome detection were not related to outcome. After multivariable analysis, a GFR <60ml/min/1.73m2 remained independently associated with adverse outcome.
