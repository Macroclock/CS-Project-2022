Intoxicated Donors and Heart Transplant Outcomes: Long-Term Safety. The opioid crisis has led to an increase in available donor hearts, although questions remain about the long-term outcomes associated with the use of these organs. Prior studies have relied on historical information without examining the toxicology results at the time of organ offer. The objectives of this study were to examine the long-term survival of heart transplants in the recent era, stratified by results of toxicological testing at the time of organ offer as well as comparing the toxicology at the time of donation with variables based on reported history. The United Network for Organ Sharing database was requested as well as the donor toxicology field. Between 2007 and 2017, 23â€‰748 adult heart transplants were performed. United Network for Organ Sharing historical variables formed a United Network for Organ Sharing Toxicology Score and the measured toxicology results formed a Measured Toxicology Score. Survival was examined by the United Network for Organ Sharing Toxicology Score and Measured Toxicology Score, as well as Cox proportional hazards models incorporating a variety of risk factors. The number and percent of donors with drug use has significantly increased over the study period ( Among donors accepted for transplantation, neither history nor toxicological evidence of drug use was associated with significant differences in survival. Increasing use of such donors may help alleviate the chronic donor shortage. 'cocaine', 'heart transplantation', 'risk factor', 'survival', 'toxicology'
