Left atrial appendage occlusion using a Watchman device in a transplanted heart with biatrial anastomosis. A percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion using a Watchman device was performed in a patient with prior biatrial anastomosis orthotopic heart transplant (OHT). Due to the anatomical changes following biatrial anastomosis, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) imaging and transseptal puncture become technically challenging. We describe how the standard LAA views on TEE were obtained for device sizing, and how the transseptal puncture was modified to cross the scarred septum. This case demonstrates that LAA occlusion using a Watchman device in biatrial anastomosis OHT is safe and can successfully be done.
