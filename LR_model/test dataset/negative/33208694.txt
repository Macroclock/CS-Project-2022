Heart Donation From Donors After Controlled Circulatory Death. The gold-standard therapy for advanced-stage heart failure is cardiac transplantation. Since the first heart transplant in 1967, the majority of hearts transplanted came from brain death donors. Nevertheless, in recent years, the option of donation after circulatory death (DCD) is gaining importance to increase donor pool. Currently, heart-transplant programs using controlled donation after circulatory death (cDCD) have been implemented in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Australia, United States of America, and, recently, in Spain. In this article, we performed a concise review of the literature in heart cDCD; we summarize the pathophysiology involved in ischemia and reperfusion injury during this process, the different techniques of heart retrieval in cDCD donors, and the strategies that can be used to minimize the damage during retrieval and until transplantation. Heart transplant using DCD hearts is in continuous improvement and must be implemented in experienced cardiac transplant centers.
