Left ventricular systolic function and the pattern of late-gadolinium-enhancement independently and additively predict adverse cardiac events in muscular dystrophy patients. Cardiac involvement is a frequent finding in patients with Duchenne (DMD) and Becker (BMD) muscular dystrophies. With this study, we aimed at elucidating the relationship between the phenotypic expression of cardiac involvement and the occurrence of adverse cardiac events in DMD/BMD patients. Eighty-eight male DMD/BMD patients (age 29 ± 14 yrs) were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) comprising cine- and late-gadolinium-enhancement (LGE)-CMR at study entry and were subsequently followed-up for adverse cardiac events. The primary endpoint was defined as all-cause/cardiac death or cardiac transplantation. Secondary endpoints were (1) hospitalization for heart failure and/or (2) occurrence of non-/sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). During a mean follow-up time of 47 ± 18 months, the primary endpoint was observed in three (3%) and the secondary endpoint in 21 (24%) patients. On multivariable analysis, LV-EF (HR, 95% CI: 0.94, 0.89-0.97, p = 0.001) and the presence of "transmural" LGE (HR, 95% CI: 2.89, 1.09-7.68, p = 0.033) were the only independent predictors for secondary endpoints. A cut-off for LV-EF of 45% was associated with the highest hazard ratio (HR, 95% CI: 11.50, 4.49-29.43, p < 0.0001) in a Cox regression survival analysis. In the group of patients with a LV-EF (>45%), those patients already showing "transmural" LGE had a significantly lower event-free-survival (HR, 95% CI: 13.48, 1.89-96.12, p = 0.009) compared to those without. An impaired LV systolic function (LV-EF ≤45%) and a "transmural" pattern of myocardial fibrosis independently predict the occurrence of adverse cardiac events in DMD/BMD patients. Even in DMD/BMD patients with relatively preserved LV-EF (>45%), the simple and visually assessable parameter "transmural LGE" is of additive prognostic value.
