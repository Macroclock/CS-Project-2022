Majocchi's granuloma in solid organ transplant recipients. Superficial fungal infections are fairly prevalent in transplant recipients and the incidence increases with more intense graft-conserving immunosuppressive therapy. Majocchi's granuloma is a deep folliculitis caused by dermatophytes that involves deeper layers of the dermis. Only a few case reports of the condition have been documented in transplant recipients. After an extensive review of the medical literature, 21 cases were retrieved and are summarized here, together with a new case that occurred in a recent heart transplant recipient from our institution. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Majocchi's granuloma in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, with special focus on potential risk factors, offending pathogens, clinical presentation, therapeutic approaches, and outcome. General observations are presented emphasizing the relevance of close clinical and dermatologic follow-up in high-risk SOT patients with specific comments regarding treatment regimens and outcomes.
