Clinical characteristics and survival in cardiogenic shock admissions to a UK heart transplant unit. We describe the characteristics and outcomes of cardiogenic shock (CS) admissions to a UK transplant unit, which is previously unreported. Fifty-nine unselected, consecutive patients over a 38-month period in CS (INTERMACS ≤2) and potentially eligible for transplant were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were predominantly male (76.3%), young (mean age 42.2 years) and with severe end-organ dysfunction (acute liver/kidney injury 83%, mean lactate 3.5 mmol/l). 57.6% required mechanical support and 28.8% cardiac transplant. 30 days, discharge and 1-year survival were 78, 68 and 63%, respectively. Predictors of death included no transplant, increasing age and increasing creatinine. Patients with CS and potential for transplant require significant resource input but demonstrate favorable outcomes in our experience.
