Evaluation of Biventricular Functions in Transplanted Hearts Using 3-Dimensional Speckle-Tracking Echocardiography. Background The current study aims to validate the accuracy of 3-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (3D-STE) in evaluating biventricular functions against the accuracy of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and to explore the comprehensive characteristics and normal values for 3D-biventricular functions in transplanted hearts. Methods and Results A cohort of 35 heart transplant (HT) patients underwent both 3D echocardiography and CMR examination to validate the accuracy of 3D-STE in evaluating biventricular functions (Protocol 1). Then, 3D-STE derived biventricular functions were compared between 46 HT patients and 46 non-HT controls (Protocol 2). Protocol 1, validated that 3D-STE showed excellent accuracy in evaluating biventricular functions of transplanted hearts against CMR. Protocol 2, revealed lower (normal range) 3D-biventricular ejection fractions in HT patients than in controls ( '3‐dimensional speckle‐tracking echocardiography', 'biventricular function', 'cardiac magnetic resonance', 'heart transplant', 'myocardial strain'
