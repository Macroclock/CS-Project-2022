Quality of life in adult survivors greater than 10 years after pediatric heart transplantation. This study assessed quality of life (QOL) in adult survivors of pediatric heart transplantation who survived > or = 10 years after transplantation. Prospective data were collected from heart transplant recipients who were aged > or = 18 years and had survived > or = 10 years after transplantation (transplantation between July 3, 1986, and April 4, 1997). QOL data were collected from patients using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) Health Survey. Clinical data were collected from medical records. Statistical analyses included frequencies and measures of central tendency. Twenty-three patients (65% men, 91% white) completed the study. At the study initiation, they were a mean age of 9.0 +/- 7.1 years at transplantation, and were a mean age of 25.2 +/- 5.5 years (range, 18-34 years) and a mean of 16.2 +/- 3.0 years (range, 11-22 years) post-transplantation. Most were in school or working. Mean patient QOL scores from the SF-36v2 survey were 50.56 +/- 0.5 (range, 27.3-68.9) for physical health and 49.88 +/- 11.72 (range, 23.56-62.84) for mental health, similar to the general United States population. Late complications were frequent, including transplant coronary artery disease, 3; repeat heart transplantation, 2; post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, 6; kidney transplantation, 5; acute late rejection, 5; and arrhythmias, 4. This report of QOL in adult survivors of pediatric heart transplantation shows patient perception of physical and mental health is similar to the general population despite serious late complications. A multicenter study is planned to further evaluate QOL in this unique cohort.
