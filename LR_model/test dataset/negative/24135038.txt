The unsolved problem of organ allocation in times of organ shortage: the German solution? The concept of the International and Inter-Society Co-ordination Committee (I2C2) has been introduced at the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) annual meeting in Prague. It is a pivotal role of I2C2 to develop formal relationships with other societies involved in the field of thoracic transplantation to attain mutual benefits, share membership, and achieve common goals. This editorial is on behalf of an initiative of the I2C2 committee chairs to report about a specific problem related to thoracic transplantation in 1 European country and the approach chosen by the local national authorities, together with the transplant community, to address this issue.
