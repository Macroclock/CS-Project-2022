Immediate and long-term survival after surgery for lung cancer in heart transplant recipients. Lung cancer observed after heart transplantation is considered to have a poor prognosis. However, the results of surgical treatment have not yet been significantly evaluated. This retrospective study analyzed the immediate and long-term results after surgery. From May 1990 to December 2003, 25 heart transplant recipients underwent surgery for lung cancer. There were 22 men and 3 women, the mean age was 60.7 years (49-72). All patients had a smoking history. Lung tumors were discovered by routine chest roentgenograms and computed tomography scans in 17 patients (68%), because of clinical symptoms in 7 (28%), and incidentally in 1 (4%). The surgical procedures consisted of 23 lobectomies and 2 wedge resections. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 14.2 days (5-34). The morbidity rate was 28% (n = 7 patients). The mortality rate was 12% patients (n = 3 patients). The postoperative complications in 7 of 10 patients were mainly from infectious origin. Five-year survival rate was 40.9% with a median survival of 45 months. Seven patients died during follow-up (3 from cancer and 4 from other diseases). Significant better survival was observed in N0 patients than in N+ patients (median survival of 56.8 months in N0 vs 13.5 months in N+ patients (p = 0.017). Long-term results after surgery were satisfactory in early stage disease, despite a high risk for postoperative infection. Our results underline the efficiency of a close follow-up for transplant recipients with a smoking history, leading to cancer detection at an early stage.
