[The results of the artificial heart]. The artificial heart is no more a dream but a reality. Over the last 40 years, many circulatory assist devices have been developed. First were the pneumatic devices, external or implantable, providing uni- or biventricular support; next were the partially implantable electromecanical devices. We went from the first generation of devices with all components (pump, energy power, control system) outside of the body to the second generation of devices with the pump and the motor implanted inside the body. Recently, the third generation of artificial hearts appeared with all components implanted inside the body allowing better mobility and quality of life. Results depend on the indication and on the kind of artificial heart implanted: partial (native heart still in place) or total (native heart removed). Essentially developped as a bridge to transplant, the artificial heart is now allowed as destination therapy.
