[Selection of lung transplant candidates in France in 2019]. In 2015, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) published a consensus document for the selection of lung transplant candidates. In the absence of recent French recommendations, this guideline is useful in order to send lung transplant candidates to the transplantation centers and to list them for lung transplantation at the right time. The main indications for lung transplantation in adults are COPD and emphysema, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial diseases, cystic fibrosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The specific indications for each underlying disease as well as the general contraindications have been reviewed in 2015 by the ISHLT. For cystic fibrosis, the main factors are forced expiratory volume in one second, 6-MWD, PAH and clinical deterioration characterized by increased frequency of exacerbations; for emphysema progressive disease, the BODE score, hypercapnia and FEV1; for PAH progressive disease or the need of specific intravenous therapy and NYHA classification. Finally, the diagnosis of fibrosing interstitial lung disease is usually a sufficient indication for lung transplantation assessment. These new recommendations, close to French practices, help clinicians to find the right time for referral of patients to transplantation centers. This is crucial for the prognosis of lung transplantation.
