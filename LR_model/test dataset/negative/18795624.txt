[Effect of HOE642 on cardiac myocyte apoptosis in rat non heart-beating donors]. To investigate the effect of HOE642 on cardiac myocyte apoptosis of the heterotopic heart transplantation of rat non heart-beating donors. Totally 112 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 7 groups (n=16 in each group) C, the control group (normal hearts); S10, S30, and S45 (groups of transplanted hearts after 10, 30, and 45 minutes of asystole); and SH10, SH30, and SH45 (groups of transplanted hearts after 10, 30, and 45 minutes of asystole and infused with HOE642). After rata in the experimental groups were killed by warm ischemia the donators of the S10, S30 and S45 groups were infused with 5TH-1 for 30 minutes, and the dead rats in group SH10, SH30, and SH4 were infused with STH-1 and HOE642 (20 micromol/L) for 30 minutes. Heterotopic heart transplantation were processed by the method of neck Cuff. The heart specimens of S10, SH10, S30, and SH30 groups were taken after 48 hours of transplantation, and the heart specimens of S45 and SH45 groups were taken immediately after transplantation. Then apoptotic myocytes were detected with terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated deoxyuridine-biotin nick end labeling method and the expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, and Caspase-3 proteins were detected by immunohistochemistry. The rats were discerned death when cardiac electric wave vanished after 9-11 minutes of bloodletting by transsection of abdominal aorta. The number of positive cardiac muscle cells in S10 and S30 groups were significantly larger than those in group SH10 and SH30 (P < 0.05). The levels of Bcl-2 protein expression in S10 and S30 groups were significantly lower than those in SH10 and SH30 groups (P < 0.05). The levels of Bax and Caspase-3 protein expression were significantly higher than those in SH10 and SH30 groups (P < 0.05). The rat model of a heterotopic heart transplantation on the cervical part is a convenient animal model for cardiac muscle protection. HOE642 can suppress rat cardiac muscle cells apoptosis (within 30 min) after death caused by warm ischemia.
