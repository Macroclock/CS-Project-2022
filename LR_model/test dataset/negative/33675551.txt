Factors associated with degraded trabecular bone score in heart transplant recipients. Trabecular bone score (TBS) is a textural index that provides indirect evaluation of trabecular microarchitecture. It improves fracture risk assessment in several high-risk populations. We aimed to evaluate the role of TBS assessment in heart transplant recipients (HTR). In a cross-sectional study with 87 HTR (69 males and 18 females), we assessed TBS and evaluated potential associations between TBS and factors related to increased fracture risk. We also evaluated the correlations between the presence of vertebral fractures (VF) and degraded TBS. We confirmed degraded TBS in the majority of HTR. 27.6% of HTR had partially degraded, 27.6% had degraded TBS. HTR with degraded TBS were older, had higher body mass index, lower bone mineral density (BMD), and T-score. As opposed to stable BMD over different time points, TBS significantly differed among different post-transplant time periods. TBS did not correlate with current methylprednisolone or past zoledronic acid treatment, presence of hypogonadism or diabetes. TBS did not have additional value over BMD in predicting the presence of VF. Most fractures occurred in patients with osteopenia and in patients with partly degraded TBS. Studies with longitudinal designs and larger sample sizes are warranted to further assess the potential role of TBS in HRT.
