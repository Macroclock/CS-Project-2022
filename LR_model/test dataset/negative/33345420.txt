Survival after heart transplantation for Chagas cardiomyopathy using a conventional protocol: A 10-year experience in a single center. Heart transplant (HT) remains the most frequently indicated therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure that improves prognosis in Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCM). However, the lack of benznidazole therapy and availability of RT-PCR follow-up in many centers is a major limitation to perform this life-saving intervention, as there are concerns related with the risk of reactivation. We aimed to describe the outcomes of a cohort of patients with CCM who underwent HT using a conventional protocol with mycophenolate mofetil, without benznidazole prophylaxis or RT-PCR follow-up. Retrospective cohort study. Between 2008 and 2018, 43 patients with CCM underwent HT. A descriptive analysis to characterize outcomes as rejection, infectious and neoplastic complications and a survival analysis was carried out. Median of follow-up was 4.3 (IR 4.28) years. Survival at 1 month, 1 year, and 5 years was 95%, 85%, and 75%, respectively, infections being the main cause of death (60%). Reactivations occurred in only three patients (7.34%) and were not related to mortality. This cohort showed a favorable survival and a low reactivation rate without an impact on mortality. Our results suggest that performing HT in patients with CCM following conventional guidelines and recommendations for other etiologies is a safe approach.
