Differential Impact of Class I and Class II Panel Reactive Antibodies on Post-Heart Transplant Outcomes. Sensitized patients awaiting heart transplantation spend a longer time on the waitlist and have higher mortality. We are now able to further characterize sensitization by discriminating antibodies against class I and II, but the differential impact of these has not been assessed systematically. Using United Network for Organ Sharing data (2004-2015), we analyzed 17,361 adult heart transplant patients whose class I and II panel reactive antibodies were reported. Patients were divided into 4 groups: class I and II ≤25% (group 1); class I ≤25% and class II ˃25% (group 2); class II ≤25% and class I >25% (group 3); and both class I and II >25% (group 4). Outcomes assessed were treated rejection at 1-year mortality, all-cause mortality, and rejection-related mortality. Compared with group 1, only group 4 was associated with a higher risk of treated rejection at 1 year (odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.64), all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.06-1.46), and mortality owing to rejection (subhazard ratio 1.84, 95% CI 1.18-2.85), whereas groups 2 and 3 were not (P > .05). Combined elevation in class I and II panel reactive antibodies seem to increase the risk of treated rejection and all-cause mortality, whereas risk with isolated elevation is unclear.
