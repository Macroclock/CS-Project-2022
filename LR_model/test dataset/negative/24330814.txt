A mandatory modification in extracorporeal biventricular assist device (BIVAD) implantation: intercostal tunnel application: a case report. In this case, our patient was a heart transplant candidate connected to a respiratory system. An extracorporeal biventricular assist device (BIVAD) was the only option in order to bridge to transplantation. In routine procedures, it is recommended that Berlin Heart Excor cannulas be removed through the subfascial subcostal tunnel. As the severely dilated right ventricle compressed the apex of the left ventricle, which was also dilated to the mid-back zone of the left hemithorax, the whole length of the Extracorporeal BIVAD apical cannula had to remain within the thorax; however, the cannula was removed from the body by creating a tunnel at the 7th intercostal space. In the long-term follow-up, this compulsory modification has proven to be safe and effective.
