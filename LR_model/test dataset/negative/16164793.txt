A Dobutamine paradox: eosinophilic myocarditis in the explanted heart of a 9-year-old girl undergoing cardiac transplantation. We describe a 9-year-old girl who was noted to have eosinophilic myocarditis in her native heart after it was explanted during cardiac transplantation. On the basis of absence of evidence for primary or secondary eosinophilia, we suggest that the prolonged use of dobutamine prior to transplantation might have induced the eosinophilic myocarditis.
