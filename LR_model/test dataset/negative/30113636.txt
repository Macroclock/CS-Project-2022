Successful heart-lung-kidney and domino heart transplantation following veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. A 60-year-old man with cystic fibrosis, mediastinal shift and end-stage kidney disease underwent a heart-lung-kidney transplantation. His explanted heart was used for a domino heart transplantation. This case showed an excellent outcome, even with high preoperative acuity requiring veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and continuous veno-venous haemodialysis.
