Aspects of present and future data presentation in Scandiatransplant. Scandiatransplant is the Nordic organ exchange organization having existed for almost 40 years. With close collaboration between transplant centers in the Nordic countries, it has been valuable to ensure the optimal usage of available organs. The heart is the most often exchanged organ within the collaboration. It has been decided to create a priority for hyperimmunized kidney patients for compulsory exchange of organs from deceased donors. The age of the deceased organ donors has changed from younger to older donors. The evaluation of deceased kidney transplantations and deceased liver transplantations from 1995 to 2007 is shown for 4 countries. Iceland by itself is performing living donor kidney transplantations with great intensity. Scandiatransplant will make efforts to present more data than just transplantation to yield a more complete picture of organ transplantation.
