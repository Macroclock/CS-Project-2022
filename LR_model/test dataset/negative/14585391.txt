Value of circulating adhesion molecules in assessing cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Circulating adhesion molecules have been implicated in the development of spontaneous and transplant coronary artery disease. We analyzed soluble (s) intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1), and sE-selectin levels from the coronary sinuses of 25 cardiac allograft recipients, and we correlated these molecules with the degree of acute rejection detected in endomyocardial biopsy specimens and the presence of transplant vasculopathy assessed with coronary angiography. We found that sVCAM-1 significantly increased in patients with transplant vasculopathy compared with those without transplant vasculopathy, whereas sE-selectin and sICAM-1 did not. Therefore, increased coronary sinus levels of sVCAM-1 is a reliable marker in assessing cardiac transplant vasculopathy.
