Acute fulminant myocarditis in children and adolescents: the role of mechanical circulatory assist. We report children and adolescents in fulminant myocarditis undergoing prolonged circulatory support with different assist devices. Between 1994 and 2004, seven children and adolescents (aged 7-18 years, mean age 13.5 years) were treated with VADs (5 Thoratec, 1 Medos, 1 Novacor) for circulatory support. Three patients underwent left ventricular support; biventricular support was necessary in four patients. Four patients (three left VADs, one bi-VAD) could be successfully bridged to heart transplantation after a mean support time of 163 days (56-258 days). One 7-year-old girl (Medos-BVAD) died after a support time of 11 days because of irreversible multiorgan failure. One 18-year-old patient was successfully weaned from Thoratec BVAD after 66 days with complete recovery of left ventricular function. As good markers, atrial and brain natriuretic peptides were found which reached normal values after recovery of myocardial function. A 15-year-old girl is still on the device. In children or adolescents with irreversible shock in fulminant myocarditis with an anticipated mortality of 100%, both successful bridging to heart transplantation and successful bridging to recovery are possible. Young patients with fulminant myocarditis should be rapidly transferred to a clinic with a mechanical circulatory support program to offer this life-saving option.
