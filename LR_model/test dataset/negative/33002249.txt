Treatment of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in a heart transplant recipient with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) are a group of lesions that can complicate solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and are often associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The treatment of PTLD is dependent on the type of lesion and includes a wide range of therapies, but chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has not previously been reported as a treatment option for PTLD. We present a patient who developed refractory PTLD in her right retroperitoneum, right inguinal and iliac chains, and right axillary region shortly after heart transplantation and was treated with CAR T-cell therapy. She could not tolerate complete discontinuation of immunosuppression due to the risk of rejection of a life-supporting graft. The patient's PTLD responded to CAR T-cell therapy, and her heart was monitored throughout the treatment course without any signs of rejection or ventricular dysfunction. CAR T-cell therapy may be a viable treatment option in patients who develop PTLD after a solid organ transplant.
