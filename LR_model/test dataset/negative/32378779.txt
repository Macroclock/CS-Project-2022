Visfatin serum concentration is associated with cardiac allograft vasculopathy in heart transplant recipients. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) still is one of the most important limiting factors of long-term survival following heart transplant (HT). This study aimed to investigate the association between proinflammatory adipokine-visfatin and the incidence of CAV in HT recipients. After HT, 182 patients who had a follow-up visit at the Transplantation Clinic between 2016 and 2017 were analyzed. The median age was 60.5 years, and 76.4% were men. The incidence of CAV was 54.9%. According to the multivariable proportional hazard regression analysis, visfatin level (1.795 [1.539-2.094]; P < .001) was significantly associated with CAV, and statin use was protective against CAV (0.504 [0.32-0.793]; P = .003). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve indicated an excellent discriminatory power of visfatin (0.9548 [0.9281-0.9816]) for CAV detection. The cutoff value of 5.42 ng/mL for visfatin yielded a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 91%. This is the first study to demonstrate that visfatin serum concentrations are independently associated with the incidence of CAV in HT recipients. Visfatin allows for simple and cheap detection of CAV given its excellent discriminatory ability and high sensitivity and specificity. In addition, we have found an independent association between the statin use and a lower risk of CAV.
