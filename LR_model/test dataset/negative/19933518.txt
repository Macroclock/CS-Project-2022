Three-dimensional electroanatomic entrainment map in atypical atrial flutter late after heart transplantation. Atrial flutter in the donor part of orthotopic heart transplants has been reported and successfully treated by radiofrequency ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus, but mapping and ablation of atypical flutter circuits may be challenging.(1) Entrainment mapping has been used in combination with activation mapping to define the mechanism of atypical atrial flutter. Here, we report a case where colour-coded three-dimensional (3D) entrainment mapping allowed us to accurately determine and visualize the 3D location of the reentrant circuit and to plan the ablation of a left atrial flutter without the need for activation mapping.
