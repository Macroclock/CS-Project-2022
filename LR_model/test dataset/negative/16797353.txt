Hybrid pulmonary artery conduit angioplasty for heterotopic heart transplantation. Heterotopic heart transplantation is rare in clinical practices. It carries technical difficulty not only during transplantation procedures, but also in the postoperative surveillance. We report two cases of heterotopic heart transplantation, which were complicated by pulmonary artery conduit stenosis within 2 years. We applied a less invasive approach combining cardiovascular surgeons with an interventional cardiologist. Through the donor heart right ventricular outflow tract, we performed balloon angioplasty and stent deployment. An excellent angiographic result with minimal residual pressure gradient was achieved in both patients.
