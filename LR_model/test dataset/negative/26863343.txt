A Novel Microsurgical Model for Heterotopic, En Bloc Chest Wall, Thymus, and Heart Transplantation in Mice. Exploration of novel strategies in organ transplantation to prolong allograft survival and minimizing the need for long-term maintenance immunosuppression must be pursued. Employing vascularized bone marrow transplantation and co-transplantation of the thymus have shown promise in this regard in various animal models. Vascularized bone marrow transplantation allows for the uninterrupted transfer of donor bone marrow cells within the preserved donor microenvironment, and the incorporation of thymus tissue with vascularized bone marrow transplantation has shown to increase T-cell chimerism ultimately playing a supportive role in the induction of immune regulation. The combination of solid organ and vascularized composite allotransplantation can uniquely combine these strategies in the form of a novel transplant model. Murine models serve as an excellent paradigm to explore the mechanisms of acute and chronic rejection, chimerism, and tolerance induction, thus providing the foundation to propagate superior allograft survival strategies for larger animal models and future clinical application. Herein, we developed a novel heterotopic en bloc chest wall, thymus, and heart transplant model in mice using a cervical non-suture cuff technique. The experience in syngeneic and allogeneic transplant settings is described for future broader immunological investigations via an instructional manuscript and video supplement.
