The concept of quality of life in organ transplantation. The goal of organ transplantation is not only to ensure the survival of individuals with end-stage heart, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas, and small bowel diseases, but also to offer patients the health they enjoyed before the disease, achieving a good balance between the functional efficacy of the graft and the patient's psychological and physical integrity. Quality of life (QoL) assessments are used to evaluate the physical, psychological, and social domains of health, seen as distinct areas that are influenced by a person's experiences, beliefs, expectations, and perceptions, and QoL is emerging as a new medical indicator in transplantation medicine too.
