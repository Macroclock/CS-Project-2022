IL-6 promotes cardiac graft rejection mediated by CD4+ cells. IL-6 mediates numerous immunologic effects relevant to transplant rejection; however, its specific contributions to these processes are not fully understood. To this end, we neutralized IL-6 in settings of acute cardiac allograft rejection associated with either CD8(+) or CD4(+) cell-dominant responses. In a setting of CD8(+) cell-dominant graft rejection, IL-6 neutralization delayed the onset of acute rejection while decreasing graft infiltrate and inverting anti-graft Th1/Th2 priming dominance in recipients. IL-6 neutralization markedly prolonged graft survival in the setting of CD4(+) cell-mediated acute rejection and was associated with decreased graft infiltrate, altered Th1 responses, and reduced serum alloantibody. Furthermore, in CD4(+) cell-dominated rejection, IL-6 neutralization was effective when anti-IL-6 administration was delayed by as many as 6 d posttransplant. Finally, IL-6-deficient graft recipients were protected from CD4(+) cell-dominant responses, suggesting that IL-6 production by graft recipients, rather than grafts, is necessary for this type of rejection. Collectively, these observations define IL-6 as a critical promoter of graft infiltration and a shaper of T cell lineage development in cardiac graft rejection. In light of these findings, the utility of therapeutics targeting IL-6 should be considered for preventing cardiac allograft rejection.
