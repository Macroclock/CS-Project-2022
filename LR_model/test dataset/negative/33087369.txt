Living with a left ventricular assist device: psychological burden and coping: protocol for a cross-sectional and longitudinal qualitative study. Due to technological progress and persistent shortage of donor hearts, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have become established in the treatment of advanced heart failure. Accordingly, more patients live with LVADs for prolonged periods. Related research focused primarily on clinical issues and little is known about psychosocial aspects of living with an LVAD. This study aims to explore psychological burden and coping following LVAD implantation. An exploratory qualitative study with cross-sectional and longitudinal elements will be carried out. At least 18 patients with LVAD who have the device implanted from a few weeks to more than 3 years will be interviewed in the cross-sectional component using an interview guide. A subsample of patients who live with the LVAD for up to 3 months when recruited will be interviewed two additional times in the following year. The cross-sectional interviews will be analysed using an inductive qualitative content analysis to describe psychological burden, coping resources and behaviour from the patient's perspective. Based on the findings, the longitudinal interviews will be analysed with a deductive content analysis to explore psychological adjustment during the first year after implantation. The findings will provide a deeper understanding of the complex and specific situation of patients with LVAD and of psychological adjustment to living with a life-sustaining implant. This can help clinicians in considering individual aspects to promote patient outcomes and is the basis for further research on healthcare interventions or technical solutions to reduce burden and for developing rehabilitation measures to promote psychosocial outcomes. Ethical approval was obtained from the ethics committee of the School of Medicine and Health Sciences at the University of Oldenburg (2019-023). Study findings will be disseminated at national and international conferences and through peer-reviewed journals. German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00016883).
