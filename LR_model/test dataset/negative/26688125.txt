Mycobacterium genavense infection in a solid organ recipient: a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Renal transplant recipients are highly susceptible to infections caused by uncommon pathogens because of their immunocompromised state. We report a case of disseminated Mycobacterium genavense infection in a patient with a combined renal and cardiac transplant. Diagnosing M. genavense infections remains a challenge because of the absence of specific clinical symptoms in combination with the difficulties of culturing the organism using standard mycobacterial culture procedures. This clinical case demonstrates the importance of molecular techniques as part of the initial work-up in order to rapidly establish the diagnosis.
