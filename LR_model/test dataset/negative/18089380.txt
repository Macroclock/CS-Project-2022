A prospective cross-over study comparing the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine A and its metabolites after oral versus short-time intravenous cyclosporine A administration in pre-heart transplant patients. Sometimes intravenous administration of cyclosporine (CsA) is essential before oral administration is possible. There are only a few reports available on the interindividual variability of CsA metabolism and different metabolite pattern depending on intravenous versus oral administration of CsA in heart transplant (HTx) patients. For effective inhibition of calcineurin we used a short infusion reaching peak concentrations after 2 hours. In a prospective cross-over study we compared the pharmacokinetics of CsA and its metabolites after oral (2.0 mg/kg body weight) versus intravenous (0.7 mg/kg body weight; 2-hour infusion) CsA administration (single test dose) in 7 pre-HTx patients. The pharmacokinetic parameters of CsA and its metabolites were analyzed using high-pressure liquid chromatography. The pharmacokinetic parameter area under the concentration time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) of CsA after intravenous administration was significantly lower (2903 ng*h*mL(-1)) than that after oral administration (4344 ng*h*mL(-1); P=.01). Peak concentrations, time to peak concentration, and terminal elimination half life were not significantly different. Short-time infusion of CsA resulted in a significant decrease in the AUC of the metabolites AM1 (3-fold), AM9 (10-fold), and AM1c (3-fold). A 2-hour infusion of CsA is just as effective as oral administration and the reduced amount of metabolites is advantageous for the patient.
