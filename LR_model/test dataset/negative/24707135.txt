Clinical management of inflammatory bowel disease in the organ recipient. There was estimated a higher incidence of de novo inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) after solid organ transplantation than in the general population. The onset of IBD in the organ transplant recipient population is an important clinical situation which is associated to higher morbidity and difficulty in the medical therapeutic management because of possible interaction between anti-reject therapy and IBD therapy. IBD course after liver transplantation (LT) is variable, but about one third of patients may worsen, needing an increase in medical therapy or a colectomy. Active IBD at the time of LT, discontinuation of 5-aminosalicylic acid or azathioprine at the time of LT and use of tacrolimus-based immunosuppression may be associated with an unfavorable outcome of IBD after LT. Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) therapy for refractory IBD may be an effective and safe therapeutic option after LT. The little experience of the use of biological therapy in transplanted patients, with concomitant anti-rejection therapy, suggests there be a higher more careful surveillance regarding the risk of infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, and neoplasms. An increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) is present also after LT in IBD patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). An annual program of endoscopic surveillance with serial biopsies for CRC is recommended. A prophylactic colectomy in selected IBD/PSC patients with CRC risk factors could be a good management strategy in the CRC prevention, but it is used infrequently in the majority of LT centers. About 30% of patients develop multiple IBD recurrence and 20% of patients require a colectomy after renal transplantation. Like in the liver transplantation, anti-TNFα therapy could be an effective treatment in IBD patients with conventional refractory therapy after renal or heart transplantation. A large number of patients are needed to confirm the preliminary observations. Regarding the higher clinical complexity of this subgroup of IBD patients, a close multidisciplinary approach between an IBD dedicated gastroenterologist and surgeon and an organ transplantation specialist is necessary in order to have the best clinical management of IBD after transplantation.
