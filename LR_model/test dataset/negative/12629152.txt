Differentiation of stress, metabolism, communication, and defense responses following transplantation. The biological complexity of allograft rejection and alloantigen-independent mechanisms is poorly understood. Therefore, we analyzed four components of the biological response following transplantation by global gene analysis. A comparative and kinetic approach was used to identify gene expression profiles. Biological processes were assigned to genes displaying the largest alterations in expression. Metabolism, stress response, and cell organization were the predominant, biological processes associated with ischemia and systemic stress. Innate and adaptive immune responses induced a transcriptional shift toward defense and cell communication. The kinetic analysis showed a shift from innate toward adaptive responses in the post-transplant course.
