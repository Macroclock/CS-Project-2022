Racial and Ethnic Disparities Persist in the Current Era of Pediatric Heart Transplantation. Previous studies have demonstrated that children in the United States who were of racial and ethnic minorities have inferior waitlist and post-heart transplant (HT) outcomes. Whether these disparities still exist in the contemporary era of increased ventricular assist device use remains unknown. All children (age <18 years) in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database listed for HT from December 2011 to February 2019 were included and were separated into 5 races/ethnicities: Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, Asian, and Other. Differences in clinical characteristics and survival among children of different racial/ethnic groups were compared at listing and at HT. The waitlist cohort consisted of 2134 (52.2%) Caucasian, 840 (20.5%) African American, 808 (19.8%) Hispanic, 161 (3.9%) Asian, and 146 children of Other races (3.6%). At listing, Asian children mostly had cardiomyopathy (70.8%), whereas Caucasian children had congenital heart disease (58.7%). African American children were most likely to be listed as Status 1A and to have renal dysfunction and hypoalbuminemia at listing. African American and Hispanic children were most likely to be on Medicaid. After multivariable analysis, it was found that only African American children were at increased risk for waitlist mortality as compared to Caucasian children (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.25; P = 0.029). Post-HT, there were no disparities in early and midterm graft survival among groups, but African American children had increased numbers of rejection episodes compared to Caucasian and Hispanic children. African American children continue to experience increased waitlist mortality and have increased rejection episodes post-HT. Studies exploring barriers to health care access and implicit bias as reasons for these disparities need to be conducted.
