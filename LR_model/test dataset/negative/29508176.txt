Factor VIIa administration in orthotopic heart transplant recipients and its impact on thromboembolic events and post-transplant outcomes. Recombinant, activated factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is used during cardiac surgeries to mitigate refractory coagulopathic bleeding. The purpose of this study was to examine whether rFVIIa use in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients was associated with a higher incidence of thromboembolic (TE) events compared to patients who did not. A single-center, retrospective, cohort study was performed on OHT recipients who received rFVIIa for refractory coagulopathic bleeding from January 2013 to December 2015. Patients were evaluated for up to 6 months after transplantation and assessed for TE events, rejection, readmissions, graft survival, and patient survival. Categorical variables were analyzed using the Chi square test while student's t or ANOVA testing was utilized for continuous variables. Of the 62 patients who met inclusion criteria, 27 patients received rFVIIa, and 35 patients were selected for the control group. The overall incidence of TE events was not significantly different between patients who received rFVIIa compared to patients in the control group (14.8% vs 11.4%) (p = 0.69). Within 14 days, 14.81% of rFVIIa patients suffered a TE event compared to 5.7% of the control group (p = 0.23). Rejection, readmissions, graft survival, and patient survival were not significantly different at any time points. Use of rFVIIa in heart transplantation showed no difference in the overall rate of TE events, however, there was a nonsignificant trend toward higher risk of early TE development in the rFVIIa group compared to the control group.
