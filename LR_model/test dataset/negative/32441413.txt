Outcomes of the Treatment with Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir following heart transplantation utilizing hepatitis C viremic donors. The use of direct-acting antivirals (DAA) has expanded transplantation from hepatitis C viremic donors (HCV-VIR). Our team has conducted an open-label, prospective trial to assess outcomes transplanting HCV viremic hearts. Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB) was our sole DAA. Serial quantitative hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA PCR was obtained to assess HCV viral titers. Between January 2018 and June 2019, a total of 50 recipients were transplanted. Of these, 22/50 (44%) were from HCV-VIR, the remaining 28 from non-viremic (HCV NON-VIR) donors. An 8-week course of GLE/PIB was initiated at 1 week post-transplant. There was no difference in demographic or clinical parameters between groups. All 22 recipients of HCV-VIR transplants became viremic. GLE/PIB was effective in decreasing viremia to undetectable levels by 6 weeks post-transplant in all patients. The median time to first undetectable HCV quantitative PCR was (4.3 weeks, IQR: 4-5.7 weeks). All patients demonstrated sustained undetectable viral load through 1-year follow-up. There was no difference in survival at one year between HCV NON-VIR 28/28: (100%) vs HCV-VIR 21/22 (95%) recipients. Our center reports excellent outcomes in transplanting utilizing hearts from HCV-VIR donors. No effect on survival or co-morbidity was found. An 8-week GLE/PIB course was safe and effective when initiated approximately 1 week post-transplant.
