Does the episode of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in cardiac donors increase the risk of heart transplantation? The aim of this study is to evaluate the risk of accepting cardiac donors after an episode of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Since 1997, 13 resuscitated donor hearts (10 M, 3 F, age 15-54 years) after sudden cardiac arrest have been transplanted. The retrospective analysis was used. Allografts after resuscitation episode were implanted in 13 patients (6 M, 7 F, age 31-65 years). 11 patients were on the urgency list and two of them required periodically intravenous inotropic therapy. Two patients (P.A, B.J) died in the first 24 hours after procedure (cause of death: pulmonary embolism, extensive cardiac ischemia). During follow up (6-48 months, avg. 25.1 +/- 15.9 months) none of the 11 patients died. All patients are NYHA functional class I or I/II. Total time of cardiopulmonary resuscitation did not influence the time of reperfusion (p > 0.05). Analysis of cardiac index Cl (l/min/m2) at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 72 hours after heart transplantation showed correct values during following days. Echocardiographic and invasive examinations (8 patients) do not show any abnormalities. These results suggest that acceptance of cardiac donors after cardiopulmonary resuscitation may not increase the risk of heart transplantation.
