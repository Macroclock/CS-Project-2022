Mild acute cellular rejection and development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy assessed by intravascular ultrasound and coronary angiography in heart transplant recipients-a SCHEDULE trial substudy. To evaluate the association between mild acute cellular rejection (ACR) and the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) after heart transplantation (HTx). Substudy of the SCHEDULE trial (n = 115), where de novo HTx recipients were randomized to (i) everolimus with early CNI elimination or (ii) CNI-based immunosuppression. Seventy-six patients (66%) were included based on matched intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) examinations at baseline and year 3 post-HTx. Biopsy-proven ACR within year 1 post-HTx was recorded and graded (1R, 2R, 3R). Development of CAV was assessed by IVUS and coronary angiography at year 3 post-HTx. Median age was 53 years (45-61), and 71% were male. ACR was recorded in 67%, and patients were grouped by rejection profile: no ACR (33%), only 1R (42%), and ≥2R (25%).
