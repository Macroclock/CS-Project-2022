Intentional ABO-incompatible heart transplantation: a case report of 2 adult patients. In 2009, we started to screen all patients on the heart transplant waiting list for the presence of blood group anti-A or anti-B antibodies. From our experience with ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation, we know that transplantation can safely be performed if the antibody level is reduced to a titer of immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1:8. We decided to accept all patients with anti-A or anti-B antibody titer â‰¤1:8 for ABO-incompatible heart transplantation without any special pre-treatment and patients with antibody titers of IgG 1:16 and 1:32, provided 1 apheresis session could be performed immediately before transplantation. We found 6 of 13 patients were suitable for this program, and 2 ABO incompatible patients underwent successful transplantation with a follow-up of 1 year. In heart transplant candidates where there are problems obtaining a compatible heart and who are not suitable for ventricular assist device support, ABO-incompatible heart transplantations can be considered using our protocol, provided that the levels of anti-A or anti-B antibodies are low.
