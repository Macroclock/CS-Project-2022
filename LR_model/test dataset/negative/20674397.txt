Aortic valve pathophysiology during left ventricular assist device support. The increased applicability and excellent results with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have revolutionized the available treatment options for patients with advanced heart failure. Pre-existing valve abnormalities are common in this population, and subsequent development of valve abnormalities after LVAD placement is also often noted. Although native mitral and tricuspid valve disease is more common in heart failure patients before LVAD placement, aortic valves are much more likely to generate abnormal pathophysiology in the LVAD patient during as well as after LVAD placement. The aim of this comprehensive review is to review aortic valve function in LVAD patients and highlight the consideration of pre-existing valve disease on patient treatment at the time of LVAD implant. The basis for structural changes leading to valve pathophysiology during and after LVAD placement will be described, providing a basis for improved clinical understanding and new strategies to prevent these conditions.
