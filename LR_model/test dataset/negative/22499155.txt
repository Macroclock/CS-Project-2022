Cardiac sarcoid: a clinician's review on how to approach the patient with cardiac sarcoid. Cardiac sarcoid is an infiltrative, granulomatous disease of the myocardium. It is more prevalent entity than once believed, especially subclinical disease. It affects heart mechanics causing ventricular failure, and disrupts the cardiac electrical system leading to third degree heart block, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. This makes early diagnosis and treatment of this devastating disease essential. Based on reviewed literature this paper proposes step-wise diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms for patients with suspected cardiac sarcoidoisis who do or do not have prior history of systemic sarcoidosis.
