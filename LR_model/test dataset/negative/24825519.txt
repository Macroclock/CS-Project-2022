Gene transfer of the S24F regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted-chemokine ligand 5 variant attenuates cardiac allograft rejection. Regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES)-chemokine ligand 5 plays a key role in mediating heart transplant rejection. Suppression of RANTES-mediated signals can reduce leukocyte recruitment and mitigate transplant rejection severity. The present study describes the construction of an adenovirus overexpression vector encoding a natural S24F RANTES variant as a means of reducing leukocyte recruitment, resulting in the prevention of allograft rejection. The in vitro transendothelial chemotaxis assay was used to compare RANTES-induced transmigration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells across human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultured on the upper Transwell chamber. Intracoronary delivery of Ad-S24F, Ad-Null, or phosphate-buffered saline was performed in BALB/c donor hearts that were transplanted into the abdominal cavity of C57BL/6 recipients as a measure of allograft survival. Intragraft inflammatory cell infiltrates and associated proinflammatory cytokine expression profiles were detected by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction on day 6 after transplantation, respectively. Regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted-induced peripheral blood mononuclear cell transendothelial chemotaxis is inhibited by S24F (Ad-S24F, 9.2%±0.02%; Ad-Null, 17.7%±0.02%; medium control, 15.1%±0.01%; P<0.05). Cardiac allograft survival was prolonged after delivery of 1×10 plaque-forming units of Ad-S24F (13.00±0.33 days compared with 9.38±0.60 and 9.00±0.38 days after Ad-Null or phosphate-buffered saline treatment, respectively, P<0.05). S24F gene transfer reduced the number of intragraft CD8 T lymphocytes, monocyte-macrophages, and T-cell receptor αβ cell infiltrates (P<0.05) and decreased transcripts for RANTES and interferon-γ (P<0.05). S24F is an important component of the chemokine network involved in regulating the biologic activity of RANTES, and its expression can be used in the prevention and treatment of cardiac allograft rejection.
