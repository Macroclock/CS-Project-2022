Single center experience of aortic bypass graft for aortic arch obstruction in children. The purpose of this study is to access the outcomes of aortic bypass graft placement in children. This is a retrospective review of all children having aortic bypass graft placement for aortic arch obstruction for the first time between 1982 and 2013 at a single institution. The actuarial survival and the freedom from aortic arch reoperation were calculated and compared between the groups. Seventy consecutive children underwent aortic bypass graft placements. The median age and body weight at the operation were 14 days and 3.6 kg. There were 7 early deaths, 6 late deaths, and 7 heart transplants during the median follow-up of 10.8 years (0.0-31.5 years). The actuarial transplant free survival was 64.7 % at 20 years and the freedom from aortic arch reoperation was 50.5 % at 10 years. Between the children younger than 1 year old and older than 1 year old, there were significant differences in actuarial transplant free survival (56.4 vs. 100 % at 15 years, p = 0.0042) and in the freedom from aortic arch reoperation (18.7 vs. 100 % at 10 years, p < 0.001). The children who received aortic bypass graft larger than 16 mm in size had no aortic arch reoperation at 15 years. The aortic bypass graft placement for aortic arch obstruction can be done with low mortality and morbidity for children who can receive bypass graft larger than 16 mm in size. However, it should be avoided for the neonates and infants except selected situations. 'Aortic arch', 'Coarctation', 'Congenital heart disease', 'Outcomes'
