Post-heart transplant tumors: chronology and impact on survival. Tumors are the second leading cause of death beyond the first year heart transplantation (HT). The aim of our study was to establish a chronology for the occurrence and the impact on overall survival of de novo neoplasms after HT. We included 597 patients undergoing HT from January 1987 to December 2008. De novo tumors were classified into groups: Kaposi's sarcoma, melanoma, epidermoid skin carcinoma, other skin tumors, lung neoplasms, bladder tumors, prostate adenocarcinoma, digestive tumors, lymphomas, and other tumors. We based the study on the median value and interquartile range of the tumors to estimate their occurrence. Survival rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank tests. We included only patients with survivals beyond 1 year after HT. A total of 109 tumors developed during the follow-up. There were no differences in the survival of patients who lived more than 1 year regarding the development or not of a tumor (155±8 vs 179±6 months; P=.177). The incidence of tumor occurrence after HT was high (18.25%). There were several periods in which the occurrence of certain tumors was more frequent, while other periods appeared to be tumor-free. As most tumors were skin cancers, their impact on overall survival was low.
