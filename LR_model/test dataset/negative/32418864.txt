Risk assessment of chronic lung allograft dysfunction phenotypes: Validation and proposed refinement of the 2019 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation classification system. Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is a heterogeneous condition. Characterization of CLAD phenotypes is essential to enhance the understanding of pathogenesis and guide new therapies. The study objective was to validate the new International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) CLAD classification system and further explore patients who do not fall into the defined CLAD sub-categories. We performed a single-center, retrospective cohort study of adult, first, bilateral lung transplants performed from 2010 to 2015. Patients with CLAD were classified on the basis of the 2019 ISHLT consensus document. CLAD phenotypes and other potential predictors of survival after CLAD onset were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Among the 174 subjects with CLAD, 104 (59.8%) had bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), 16 (9.2%) restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS), 9 (5.2%) mixed, and 19 (10.9%) undefined phenotype. A total of 26 patients (14.9%) did not match any of these 4 categories and remained unclassified. Allograft survival post-CLAD onset was longer for patients with BOS (median, 500 days) than patients with RAS (median, 372 days) or mixed (median, 328 days). The 45 patients (26.8%) with undefined/unclassified phenotype were combined and recategorized on the basis of the presence or absence of characteristic RAS-like opacities on chest imaging; those with RAS-like opacities had significantly worse allograft survival than patients with BOS (hazard ratio, 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-3.93; p = 0.014) and similar survival to RAS or mixed phenotype. The new ISHLT CLAD phenotype classification is informative with regards to post-CLAD outcomes. Chest imaging demonstrating persistent parenchymal or pleural fibrosis may be used for risk-stratification of patients who do not match the major CLAD phenotypes.
