Risk factors for failed staged palliation after bidirectional Glenn in infants who have undergone stage one palliation. The bidirectional Glenn procedure (BDG) is a routine intermediary step in single-ventricle palliation. In this study, we examined risk factors for death or transplant and failure to reach Fontan completion after BDG in patients, who had previously undergone stage one palliation (S1P). All patients at our institution, who underwent BDG following S1P between 2002 and 2009 (n=194), were included in the analysis. Transplant-free survival through 18 months post BDG was 91%. Univariable competing risk analyses showed atrioventricular valve regurgitation (AVVR) >mild, age ≤ 3 months at BDG, ventricular dysfunction >mild, and prolonged hospital stay after S1P to be associated with increased risk of death or orthotopic heart transplant. Multivariable competing risk analysis through 5 years of follow-up showed >mild AVVR (hazard ratio (HR) 7.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.0-18.8), prolonged hospitalization after S1P (HR 4.5, 95% CI 1.8-11.5), and age ≤ 3 months at BDG (HR 6.8, 95% CI 2.3-20.0) to be independent risk factors for death or transplant. Concomitantly, > mild AVVR and age ≤ 3 months were independently associated with an overall decreased rate of Fontan completion. Pre-BDG AVVR, age ≤ 3 months at time of BDG, and prolonged hospitalization after S1P are independently associated with decreased successful progression of staged palliation in midterm follow-up after BDG.
