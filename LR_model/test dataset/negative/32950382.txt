Cocaine use in organ donors and long-term outcome after heart transplantation: An International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation registry analysis. Cardiac allografts from donors with a history of cocaine use (DHCU) are often discarded owing to concerns regarding organ quality. We investigated long-term outcomes of de novo adult heart transplantation (HTx) using DHCU. Using the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Thoracic Organ Transplant Registry, we identified 24,430 adult recipients of primary, deceased donor, heart-alone transplants between January 1, 2000, and June 30, 2013. Transplants were categorized on the basis of DHCU. Survival rates were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. A total of 3,246 (13.3%) HTx were performed using DHCU during the study period. Of these, 1,477 (45.5%) were classified as current users. Organs from DHCU were transplanted at a later sequence number (data from a sub-group of patients transplanted in the United States) than those from the non-cocaine use group (mean sequence number 16.1 ± 55.6 vs 11.5 ± 38.2; p < 0.001), suggesting higher decline rates by centers. Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were not different between groups (p = 0.16), with post-transplant survival rates at 1, 5, and 10 years of 88.1%, 75.8%, and 58.5%, respectively, in the non-cocaine use group and 90.0%, 76.7%, and 59.7%, respectively, in the DHCU group. On multivariate analysis, DHCU were not associated with mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.88-1.00; p = 0.050), cardiac allograft vasculopathy (HR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.94-1.11; p = 0.56), or allograft rejection (HR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.92-1.05; p = 0.61). Our findings demonstrate that adult HTx performed using DHCU is not associated with an adverse impact on long-term clinical outcomes. These findings should spur efforts to reduce discard rates of organs from DHCU. 'cardiac allograft vasculopathy', 'cardiac rejection', 'cocaine', 'survival', 'transplantation'
