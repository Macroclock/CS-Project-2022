Outcome of the first successful heart-lung transplantation in the Baltic countries. Successful heart-lung complex transplantation was performed in a 48-year-old man. During the postoperative period, M. tuberculosis infection was diagnosed, and the treatment subsequently started. One year after, the patient was urgently hospitalized due to myocardial infarction. However, despite the best efforts, the patient died. Antituberculosis treatment is recommended to all the patients with confirmed active tuberculosis. Treatment of tuberculosis in transplant recipients is similar to that of the general population, with the exclusion of rifamycins in the regimen and longer duration of treatment.
