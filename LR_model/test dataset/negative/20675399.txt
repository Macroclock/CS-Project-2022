Giant left atrial thrombus 17 years after orthotopic heart transplantation. We present the case of a 66-year-old woman who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation 17 years earlier for dilated cardiomyopathy. After 7 years allograft coronary vasculopathy developed requiring coronary artery angioplasty. In year 15 postoperatively she experienced congestive heart failure and she became symptomatic requiring diuretics and digoxin treatment. In year 16 postoperatively a routine coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography study revealed a giant thrombus in the left atrium. The patient had had no thromboembolic-related symptoms. Anticoagulation therapy was introduced and the patient has not presented any thromboembolic-related complication. As the symptoms of cardiac insufficiency worsened we decided to evaluate the patient for re-transplantation.
