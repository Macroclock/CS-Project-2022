Long-Term Renal Function Between Left Ventricular Assist Device Therapy and Heart Transplantation. I have read with a great interest the article written by Arshad etÂ al titled "Comparison of Renal Outcomes in Patients With Left Ventricular Assist Device and Heart Transplantation," which demonstrates better 1-year renal function among those with left ventricular assist device compared with recipients of heart transplantation. These findings would help clinicians determine which therapeutic options may be best for patients with renal dysfunction. Data regarding immunosuppressant type, including everolimus, would help better clarify the respective effect on renal function. Second, long-term data beyond 12 months would be beneficial to best understand if one therapy definitively prevails over the other in regard to renal function.
