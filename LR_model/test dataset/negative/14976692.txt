A retrospective study of left ventricular assist device-related infections. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) represent considerable technological advancements, which are increasing survival and maintaining the highest quality of life for patients with chronic heart failure. A retrospective analysis of outcomes was conducted on 90 patients during LVAD support with either a Thoratec (n = 41) or HeartMate (n = 49) device, with a median of 56 days (range 3-350 days). Device-related infections occurred in 18 of the 90 subjects (20%). A significant increase in device-related infections was noted with the HeartMate LVAD (chi 2 analysis, P < .05). The drive line was the most common site of device-related infections, accounting for 52.1%, with 31.1% occurring in the pocket and 15.1% in the LVAD itself. There was little if any correlation that existed between time spent in the hospital prior to implantation of an LVAD and the development of device-related infections.
