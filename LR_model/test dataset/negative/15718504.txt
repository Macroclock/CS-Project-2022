Mixed messages: transcription patterns in failing and recovering human myocardium. In previous studies, mechanical support of medically refractory hearts with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has induced regression of many morphological and functional abnormalities characteristic of failing human hearts. To identify transcriptional adaptations in failing and LVAD-supported hearts, we performed a comprehensive transcription analysis using the Affymetrix microarray platform and 199 human myocardial samples from nonfailing, failing, and LVAD-supported human hearts. We also used a novel analytical strategy that defines patterns of interest based on multiple intergroup comparisons. Although over 3088 transcripts exhibited significantly altered abundance in heart failure, most of these did not exhibit a consistent response to LVAD support based on our analysis. Of those 238 with a consistent response to LVAD support, more than 75% exhibited persistence or exacerbation of HF-associated transcriptional abnormalities whereas only 11%, 5%, and 2% exhibited partial recovery, normalization, and overcorrection responses, respectively. Even among genes implicated by previous reports of LVAD-associated myocardial improvements, partial or complete normalization of transcription did not predominate. The magnitude of differences in transcript abundance between nonfailing and failing hearts, and between failing an LVAD-supported hearts, tended to be low with changes greater than or equal to 2-fold infrequently observed. Our results indicate that morphological or functional myocardial improvements may occur without widespread normalization of pathological transcriptional patterns. These observations also suggest that many failure-associated transcriptional changes have only a limited role in regulating cardiac structure and function and may represent epiphenomena and/or nonspecific myocardial plasticity responses. Differences in mRNA localization, translation efficiency, and posttranslational protein modifications or interactions may be more pivotal in regulating myocardial structure and function.
