Acute Isolated Coronary Artery Dissection Causing Massive Acute Myocardial Infarction and Leading to Unsuccessful Coronary Bypass, Extracorporeal Life Support, and Successful Cardiac Transplantation. Described herein is a 42-year-old woman who suddenly developed a spontaneous isolated coronary arterial dissection which led to massive acute myocardial infarction with shock, unsuccessful coronary artery bypass grafting, transiently successful extracorporeal life support, and finally successful heart transplant. Such a sequence of events is exceedingly rare for patients with coronary dissection and prompted this report.
