Nonstandard usage of a left ventricular assist device in a patient with severe heart failure complicated by pulmonary artery thrombosis - case report. Heart failure complicated by pulmonary embolism is an extremely rare condition described in the literature. We report a case of very young patient with advanced heart failure against the background of dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology with the presence of blood clots in both ventricles. The course of treatment was complicated by acute pulmonary embolism. In emergency setting the patient was qualified for combine surgery pulmonary embolization and implantation of a continuous flow pump as a bridge for heart transplantation. The post-operative course is described in detail as well as reimplantation of the pump due to early thrombosis. Performed surgical procedures combined with alteration in anticoagulant drugs was sufficient to stabilize the clinical condition.
