ISHLT Primary Graft Dysfunction Incidence, Risk Factors, and Outcome: A UK National Study. Heart transplantation (HTx) remains the most effective long-term treatment for advanced heart failure. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) continues to be a potentially life-threatening early complication. In 2014, a consensus statement released by International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) established diagnostic criteria for PGD. We studied the incidence of PGD across the United Kingdom. We analyzed the medical records of all adult patients who underwent HTx between October 2012 and October 2015 in the 6 UK heart transplant centers Preoperative donor and recipient characteristics, intraoperative details, and posttransplant complications were compared between the PGD and non-PGD groups using the ISHLT definition. Multivariable analysis was performed using logistic regression. The incidence of ISHLT PGD was 36%. Thirty-day all-cause mortality in those with and without PGD was 31 (19%) versus 13 (4.5%) (P = 0.0001). Donor, recipient, and operative factors associated with PGD were recipient diabetes mellitus (P = 0.031), recipient preoperative bilateral ventricular assist device (P < 0.001), and preoperative extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (P = 0.023), female donor to male recipient sex mismatch (P = 0.007), older donor age (P = 0.010), and intracerebral haemorrhage/thrombosis in donor (P = 0.023). Intraoperatively, implant time (P = 0.017) and bypass time (P < 0.001) were significantly longer in the PGD cohort. Perioperatively, patients with PGD received more blood products (P < 0.001). Risk factors identified by multivariable logistic regression were donor age (P = 0.014), implant time (P = 0.038), female: male mismatch (P = 0.033), recipient diabetes (P = 0.051) and preoperative ventricular assist device/extracorporeal membranous oxygenation support (P = 0.012). This is the first national study to examine the incidence and significance of PGD after HTx using the ISHLT definition. PGD remains a frequent early complication of HTx and is associated with increased mortality.
