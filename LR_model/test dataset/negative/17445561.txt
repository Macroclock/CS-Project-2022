First case of simultaneous heart plus kidney transplantation in Chile: case report. Advanced renal disease is a formal contraindication to heart transplantation, and heart failure may make a patient ineligible for kidney transplantation. The International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation has reported 336 simultaneous heart and kidney transplantations with a 70% rate of 5 year survival. Herein we have presented the first case of simultaneous heart plus kidney transplantation in Chile. The patient is a 62-year-old man with diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension who in 1997 had a myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock and acute renal failure. He underwent a coronary bypass but developed progressive heart failure, with an ejection fraction less than 20% and moderate mitral regurgitation. He required chronic hemodialysis and survived a cardiac arrest, receiving an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Transplantation was performed in 2004 in 2 phases: initially a heart, followed by a kidney transplantation. Immunosuppression included Daclizumab, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and steroids. He developed acute renal failure but did not receive dialysis. He left the hospital at 25 days posttransplantation. Two years following double transplantation, he has not shown acute rejection episodes of either the cardiac or the kidney graft. Both cardiac and renal functions are normal. In conclusion, simultaneous heart plus kidney transplantations offer a good alternative treatment for patients with advanced disease of both organs.
