[Prognostic value of hyperuricemia in chronic heart failure]. Hyperuricemia has been proposed as a risk marker in chronic heart failure, but its value as an independent prognostic is not well established. To determine the prognostic value of hyperuricemia, in patients with chronic stable heart failure. Forty six male patients with chronic heart failure, aged 62 +/- 13 years, were studied. Their election fraction was less than 40% and their serum creatinine was less than 2 mg/dl. Serum uric acid and catecholamines, maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) and left ventricular ejection fraction were measured. Mortality and the need for cardiac transplant were recorded as endpoints during a mean follow up of 39 +/- 18 months. The relationship between basal measures and the occurrence of events was analyzed using univariate and multivariate methods. Basal VO2 max and left ventricular ejection fraction were 16 +/- 4.6 ml/kg/min and 22 +/- 7% respectively. Eighteen patients died and three required transplantation during the follow up. Patients reaching these endpoints had a lower VO2 max and left ventricular ejection fraction and higher uric acid levels. Multivariate analysis accepted left ventricular ejection fraction (relative risk 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.97) and serum uric acid (relative risk 1.335 95% CI 1.02-1.74) as significant predictors of events. The relative risk for cardiac transplantation was 7.07 times higher among those with a serum uric acid over 7 mg/dl. A high serum uric acid is an independent predictor of bad prognosis in patients with stable chronic heart failure.
