The new concept of ''interventional heart failure therapy'': part 2--inotropes, valvular disease, pumps, and transplantation. Recent advances in heart failure therapy include a variety of mechanical and device-based technologies that target structural aspects of heart failure that cannot be treated with drug therapy alone; these newer therapies can collectively be described as interventional heart failure therapy. This article is the second in a 2-part series reviewing interventional heart failure therapy. Interventions included in this discussion include those indicated for the treatment of end-stage refractory heart failure, including interventional medical therapy, interventional treatment of valvular disease, mechanical assist devices, and heart transplantation. Also included is a review of the currently available catheter-based pumps, which are intended to provide temporary support in patients with acute hemodynamic compromise. The use of cellular or stem cell therapy for the treatment of heart failure is an emerging interventional therapy and data supporting its use for the treatment heart failure will also be presented, as will a discussion of the role of palliative care and self-care in heart failure therapy.
