Heart transplantation in a patient with recurrent early extensive endocarditis. Active valvular endocarditis could be considered a contraindication to heart transplantation. Nevertheless, there have been some reports of success with this form of treatment, despite the characteristics of the infection and its aggressive nature. Here, we describe the case of a patient with acute bicuspid aortic valvular endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus and with a periannular abscess. Cryopreserved aortic homograft replacement of the aortic root was initially carried out, in addition to debridement and reconstruction of the interventricular septum with a pericardial patch. Early recurrence occurred, however, with extensive tissue destruction, a periaortic abscess and involvement of multiple valves, associated with severe sepsis. In view of the failure of 'conventional' surgery, an emergency heart transplantation was decided on after discussing the case with the Spanish National Transplant Organization (ONT), because of the theoretical contraindication of transplantation in this case. Transplantation was finally carried out after a waiting period of 3 days, in emergency code conditions, and the postoperative course proved uneventful, with no reinfection during the follow-up period. The present case suggests that heart transplantation may be an alternative option in patients suffering aggressive endocarditis with extensive involvement of the heart structures.
