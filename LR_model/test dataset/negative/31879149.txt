Efficacy of Early Goal-Directed Renal Replacement Therapy for the Treatment of Acute Kidney Injury After Heart Transplantation: A Single-Center 10-Year Experience. Acute kidney injury (AKI) after heart transplantation is a common and serious complication. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of early goal-directed renal replacement therapy (GDRRT) for the treatment of AKI after heart transplantation. Retrospective, observational study. Grade A tertiary hospital that performs more than 4,000 cardiac surgery procedures per year. Patients who underwent heart transplantation with postoperative AKI and received renal replacement therapy from January 2008 to June 2018. Patients were divided into a late GDRRT group (LGDRRT) (January 2008-September 2012) or an early GDRRT group (EGDRRT) (October 2012-June 2018). The LGDRRT group comprised 30 patients, and the EGDRRT group comprised 46 patients. Duration between surgery to renal replacement therapy (RRT) initiation in the EGDRRT group was significantly shorter than in the LGDRRT group (1 [1-3] d v 2 [2-3] d; p = 0.020). The in-hospital mortality in the EGDRRT group was significantly lower than that of the LGDRRT group (39.1% v 63.3%; p = 0.039). After multivariate adjustment for confounding factors, the hazard ratio for death in the LGDRRT group relative to the EGDRRT group was 2.028 (95% confidence interval 1.072-3.655; p = 0.048). Length of intensive care unit and hospital stays in the EGDRRT group was significantly shorter than that of the LGDRRT group (26 ± 18 d v 38 ± 20 d; p = 0.008 and 38 ± 33 d v 64 ± 45 d; p = 0.005, respectively). The complete renal recovery rate was much greater in the EGDRRT group than that of the LGDRRT group (50.0% v 20.0%; p < 0.001). Serum creatinine at discharge was significantly less in the EGDRRT group than that of the LGDRRT group (134.8 ± 97.3 μmol/L v 220.7 ± 113.6 μmol/L; p < 0.001). Cost of RRT in the EGDRRT group was significantly less than that of the LGDRRT group (0.54 ± 0.10 v. 0.63 ± 0.11 ten thousand USD; p < 0.001). For heart transplantation recipients with AKI, EGDRRT can reduce the in-hospital mortality and the length of intensive care unit and hospital stays, improve the complete renal recovery rate, and reduce the cost of RRT.
