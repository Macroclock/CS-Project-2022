Primary cutaneous plasmacytoma (posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, plasmacytoma-like) in a heart transplant patient. Extramedullary plasmacytomas in posttransplant patients are rarely encountered. We present the fifth case of a primary cutaneous plasmacytoma (posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, plasmacytoma-like) that developed in a heart transplant patient. The tumor presented as a solitary nodule of the skin 10 years after transplantation. It subsequently involved 2 other cutaneous sites and remained confined to the skin for 5 years. The neoplastic cells were Epstein-Barr virus small RNAs (EBER 1,2) positive and EBV-latent membrane protein 1 (LMP 1) negative, corresponding to type I EBV latency. The direct role of EBV in the development of the tumor remains uncertain.
