Hierarchical immunogenicity of donor MHC class I peptides in allotransplantation. The recognition of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) allopeptides by recipient MHC class II-restricted CD4(+) T cells via indirect pathway is a prerequisite for the generation of an immune response to the allograft. We tested 13-mer to 24-mer peptides from the MHC class I molecule for their possible immunogenicity in a fully MHC-mismatched rat strain combination. Our results confirm the hierarchical distribution of the immunogenicity of donor MHC class I peptides in the T cell alloactivation via indirect pathway. In addition, we show that allopeptide-induced immune response is critical for acute rejection of heart allografts. Among the seven allopeptides tested, peptide P1 was identified as immunodominant; it induced the greatest T cell proliferation and cytokine production in vitro as well as a significant reduction in allograft survival time. The TCR repertoire of T cells involved in the in vitro and in vivo responses induced by the dominant allopeptide P1 was found to be limited to the Vbeta10 and Vbeta 19 gene families. The identification of dominant allopeptides should greatly facilitate characterization of the specific T cell population responsible for allograft rejection and may be used to modulate the alloimmune response through antigen-specific therapy.
