The Relationship Between Spiritual Health and Quality of Life of Heart Transplant Candidates. The heart transplantation is a stressful event, and its waiting time is often associated with worsening of clinical conditions and deterioration of the patient's quality of life. Spirituality plays an important role in mental health, so the present study was conducted to investigate the relationship between spiritual health and quality of life of patients undergoing cardiac transplantation. The present descriptive study was performed on 48 patients undergoing cardiac transplantation at the Shahid Rajaee Cardiovascular Center in Tehran during the first half of 2016. The data were collected by Ellisan-Palutzian Spiritual Well-Being Scale, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) and Iranian Heart Failure Quality of Life Questionnaire (IHF-QOL). We used the SPSS v.20 software to analyze the data via descriptive statistics, parametric and non-parametric correlation and regression tests. The majority of patients (60.4%) had high spiritual health with a median score of 105, and its religious dimension was reported better (P < 0.001 and r = 0.591). With a mean of 63.23 ± 23.25, the quality of life of the majority of patients (75%) was at a poor level based on the Minnesota questionnaire. According to the IHF-QOL, the median total score was 39.50. There was a significant relationship between spiritual health score and quality of life in both questionnaires (MLHFQ: P = 0.006 and r = - 394; IHF-QOL: P = 0.022 and r = 0.329). Considering the positive relationship between spiritual health and quality of life of patients in this study, it is recommended to implement spiritual care and provide fulfillment for various needs of patients along with other medical care services.
