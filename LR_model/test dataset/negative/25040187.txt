Graft-derived CCL2 increases graft injury during antibody-mediated rejection of cardiac allografts. The pathogenic role of macrophages in antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) remains unclear. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) is a potent chemotactic factor for monocytes and macrophages. The current studies used a murine model of AMR to investigate the role of graft-derived CCL2 in AMR and how macrophages may participate in antibody-mediated allograft injury. B6.CCR5−/−/CD8−/− recipients rejected MHC-mismatched WT A/J allografts with high donor-reactive antibody titers and diffuse C4d deposition in the large vessels and myocardial capillaries, features consistent with AMR. In contrast, A/J.CCL2−/− allografts induced low donor-reactive antibody titers and C4d deposition at Day 7 posttransplant. Decreased donor-reactive CD4 T cells producing interferon gamma were induced in response to A/J.CCL2−/− versus WT allografts. Consequently, A/J.CCL2−/− allograft survival was modestly but significantly longer than A/J allografts. Macrophages purified from WT allografts expressed high levels of IL-1β and IL-12p40 and this expression and the numbers of classically activated macrophages were markedly reduced in CCL2-deficient allografts on Day 7. The results indicate that allograft-derived CCL2 plays an important role in directing classically activated macrophages into allografts during AMR and that macrophages are important contributors to the inflammatory environment mediating graft tissue injury in this pathology, suggesting CCL2 as a therapeutic target for AMR.
