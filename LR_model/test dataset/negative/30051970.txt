Protein-losing enteropathy in an adult with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy: complete reversal by heart transplantation. Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) due to leakage of lymph into the gut sometimes occurs in young patients after Fontan palliation but is very rarely reported with other aetiologies of chronic heart failure (HF). PLE leads to severe hypoalbuminemia and immunodeficiency and is associated with poor prognosis. The mechanisms and the predispositions to PLE are poorly understood. Here, we report an adult patient with advanced HF due to non-ischaemic non-dilated hypocontractile cardiomyopathy who developed severe PLE, probably owing to increased ventricular stiffness and constraint by atypically placed epicardial electrode encircling both ventricles. Importantly, both PLE and immunodeficiency completely resolved after heart transplantation. 'Cardiac transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Protein-losing enteropathy'
