Validation of the usefulness of 2-dimensional strain parameters to exclude acute rejection after heart transplantation: a multicenter study. Two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography has emerged as a promising alternative to endomyocardial biopsy to rule out acute cellular rejection after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) in single center studies. In an original cohort, 15.5% and 17% of cutoff points for left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) and free-wall right ventricular longitudinal strain, respectively, achieved 100% negative predictive value to exclude moderate or severe acute cellular rejection (ACR ≥ 2R). Our objective was to demonstrate the usefulness of speckle-tracking and validate these cutoff points in an external cohort. A prospective, multicenter study that included patients who were monitored during their first year after OHT was conducted. Echocardiographic studies analyzed by local investigators were compared with simultaneous paired endomyocardial biopsies samples. A total of 501 endomyocardial biopsy-echocardiographic studies were included in 99 patients. ACR≥2R was present in 7.4% of samples. LVGLS and free-wall right ventricular longitudinal strain were significantly reduced during ACR≥2R on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, LVGLS was independently associated with the presence of ACR≥2R. The original cutoff points demonstrated a negative predictive value of 94.3% to exclude ACR≥2R. This study maintained a strong negative predictive value to exclude ACR≥2R after OHT and LVGLS was independently associated with the presence of ACR≥2R. We propose the use of speckle-tracking, especially LVGLS, as part of the noninvasive diagnosis and management of ACR.
