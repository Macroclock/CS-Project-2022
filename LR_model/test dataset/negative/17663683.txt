Cardiac retransplantation in high risk pediatric patients. Cardiac retransplantation is often the only therapy to treat GV or other causes of allograft failure. Previous reports of retransplantation have conflicting results. In this series of 18 re-transplants in 16 patients from 1984-2005, indications for retransplantation were: GV (67%); GV with cellular rejection (28%); acute graft failure (2.5%); and chronic graft failure (2.5%). Mean age at retransplantation was 12.3 (range: 0.7-22) years with a mean primary graft survival of 5.3 years (range: 8 days-10.5 years). There was no short-term mortality with only three deaths at 4, 10, and 16 years post-retransplantation. Fourteen of 18 patients had risk factors for adverse outcomes following retransplantation: ECMO support in one patient prior to retransplantation; impaired renal function in three patients; elevated panel reactive antibody screen in seven patients; a history of PTLD in five patients; and a recent episode of rejection (13-36 days) in four patients. One-, five- and ten-year survival after retransplantation was 100%, 83% and 66%, respectively, comparable to survival after primary transplantation. Freedom from rejection was not significantly different between primary and retransplantations. All patients who underwent treatment for PTLD had excellent results after retransplantation with one recurrence 16 months after retransplant. Overall, patients had excellent survival after retransplantation even in those with risk factors for poor outcome.
