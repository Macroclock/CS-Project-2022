Multidisciplinary insights into optimizing adherence after solid organ transplantation. Nonadherence to medical treatment in transplant recipients is a major risk factor for graft rejection episodes, and it has significant financial implications. Despite its importance, there is a lack of common understanding across the disciplines involved of the key issues driving nonadherence. A qualitative study, comprising a multidisciplinary workshop, followed by a consultation exercise to validate its outcomes, was initiated to gain further insight into nonadherence behavior and to identify priorities for optimizing adherence to posttransplantation regimens. Eight statements relating to actions necessary to maximize adherence to posttransplantation medication were developed and offered for validation. All but one of these attracted a median score of 9 on an agreement scale of 1 to 10, where 10 was the highest level of agreement. The outcomes generate a structure that will facilitate communication and understanding and informing clinical practice and future research.
