A team-based approach to patients in cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock is a common clinical condition with high in-hospital mortality. Early application of appropriate interventions for cardiogenic shock-including medical therapies, revascularization, temporary hemodynamic support devices, and durable mechanical circulatory support-may improve outcomes. The number and complexity of therapies for cardiogenic shock are increasing, making time-dependent decision-making more challenging. A multidisciplinary cardiogenic shock team is recommended to guide the rapid and efficient use of these available treatments. Â© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
