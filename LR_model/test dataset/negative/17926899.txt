[Angina pectoris in patients who underwent stent implantations for severe atherosclerotic coronary lesions 16 years after heart transplantation]. The case was a 56-year-old male who underwent heart transplantation due to dilated cardiomyopathy abroad in 1990. In 2006, he suffered from anginal chest pain on effort. The coronary angiogram showed severe atherosclerotic lesions in the middle of left descending artery. A drug eluting stent, Cypher 3.5 x 23 mm was deployed, followed by balloon dilatations (4 x 8 mm). The procedure was successful without any complications. Furthermore, the 8-month follow-up angiogram showed no significant restenosis in the target vessel. There have been several reports on the outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for cardiac allograft vasculopathy. According to them, the drug eluting stent, as is used in the present case, might be a promising procedure after further evaluations.
