Paclitaxel drug-eluting stent placement for pulmonary vein stenosis as a bridge to heart-lung transplantation. Congenital pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) presents as an isolated lesion or in association with other congenital heart anomalies. The most extensive forms of the disease are uniformly fatal because neither surgical repair nor transcatheter therapy results in long-term relief of the stenosis. A case is presented involving single-ventricle physiology associated with extensive and recurrent congenital PVS despite multiple attempts with surgical therapy. Heart-lung transplantation was ultimately performed after drug-eluting stents were placed in pulmonary veins as a bridge to the transplantation.
