[Postoperative monitor of hemodynamics of orthotopic heart transplantation and treatment of its disorders]. To study the postoperative hemodynamics after heart transplantation and treatment for disorders due to denervated transplanted hearts in order to improve the short term outcome of heart transplantation. Forty one patients with endstage cardiopathy underwent orthotopic cardiac transplantation. The changes in the graft function were closely monitored during the postoperative period in order to maintain the stability of hemodynamics of the allografts. All recipients received vasoactive drug therapy and 6 recipients died of acute dysfunction of the right ventricle of the allograft during the postoperative period. The remaining patients survived well and led a life with rather good quality. The hemodynamic characteristics of a denervated grafted heart are unique. Close monitoring and good nursing care with rational administration of vasoactive drugs are the key measures for the prevention of acute dysfunction of the allograft in the early postoperative period.
