Right-to-left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ratio and prediction of right ventricular failure with continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices. Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation is an accepted therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure. Post-operative right ventricular failure (RVF) still remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. This study sought to identify echocardiography parameters to select patients with high risk of RVF after LVAD implantation. Prospectively collected pre-operative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and clinical data were evaluated in patients pre-selected for isolated LVAD or biventricular assist device (BiVAD) implantation. According to prevalence of RVF during the first post-operative 48 hours, patients were divided into those who developed RVF (isolated LVAD with RVF) and those who did not (isolated LVAD without RVF). Echocardiographic parameters for RV geometry, RV function, LV geometry, and the RV-to-LV end-diastolic diameter ratio (R/L ratio) were evaluated. For identification of the optimal cutoff of R/L ratio, receiver operating characteristics curves were constructed. An isolated LVAD was implanted in 115 patients and BiVAD in 22 patients. RVF developed in 15 patients (13%) after isolated LVAD implantation. The R/L ratio was markedly increased in the isolated LVAD with RVF and BiVAD groups compared with the isolated LVAD without RVF group. According to the receiving operating curve, the cutoff for the R/L ratio to predict RVF was 0.72. The odds ratio that RVF will develop is 11.4 in patients with an R/L ratio >0.72 (p = 0.0001). Increased R/L ratio successfully identifies patients with high risk of RVF after isolated LVAD implantation. Beyond standard measurements of RV function, the consideration of R/L ratio may be useful to improve risk stratification in patients before isolated LVAD implantation.
