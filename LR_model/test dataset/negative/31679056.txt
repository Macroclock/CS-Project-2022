Implantation of a HeartMate 3 in a 13-Year-Old Child with Dilated Cardiomyopathy. Left ventricular assist device is a well-established therapy in heart failure adults, but less in children.

Despite the size limitation, the HM3 shows promising results and our case supports its feasibility in children. 'Bridge to transplant', 'Heart failure', 'HeartMate 3', 'LVAD'
