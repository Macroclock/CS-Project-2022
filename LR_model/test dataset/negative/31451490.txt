Comparative Prognostic and Diagnostic Value of Myocardial Blood Flow and Myocardial Flow Reserve After Cardiac Transplantation. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a major cause of graft failure after cardiac transplantation. CAV is characterized by diffuse involvement of epicardial coronary arteries and the microvasculature. PET allows quantification of absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial flow reserve (MFR), which may be accurate markers of CAV severity. We compared the diagnostic and prognostic utility of stress MBF and MFR after cardiac transplantation.  'PET', 'heart transplantation', 'myocardial blood flow', 'myocardial flow reserve'
