Severe vitamin D deficiency among heart and liver transplant recipients. Although patients with end-stage organ failure are at high risk for vitamin D deficiency because of limited sunlight exposure and hepatic dysfunction, few studies have measured 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) at the time of transplantation. We measured serum 25OHD immediately after transplantation in 69 heart and liver transplant recipients. Forty-six heart and 23 liver transplant recipients were evaluated (mean age 53 yr). Mean 25OHD was well below the lower limit of the normal range (43.2 +/- 21.2 nmol/L). Ninety-one percent had levels below 75 nmol/L, the threshold commonly used to denote sufficiency, and 71% had levels below 50 nmol/L. Severe deficiency (25OHD <25 nmol/L) was found in 16%. Vitamin D levels did not differ by race, age, gender, or season. Mean 25OHD was lower among liver than heart transplant recipients (34.4 +/- 17.5 vs. 47.7 +/- 20.7 nmol/L; p < 0.03). Among liver transplant recipients, 22% had undetectable levels (<17 nmol/L). Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among heart and liver transplant recipients; those with liver failure are at greatest risk. As vitamin D deficiency has many serious skeletal and extra-skeletal sequelae, physicians who treat transplant patients should maintain a high degree of vigilance for this problem.
