Dynamic pulmonary artery obstruction causing right ventricular failure after cardiac transplantation in a patient with Mustard-Senning corrected d-transposition of the great arteries. Patients with congenital d-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA) undergoing palliative atrial baffle surgery in infancy often develop systemic ventricular failure in adulthood. If they undergo cardiac transplantation, they are prone to morphologic right ventricular (RV) failure secondary to severe pulmonary hypertension as a result of systemic ventricular failure. We report a case of a patient with d-TGA and biventricular ventricular failure requiring heart transplantation (HT) that developed RV failure postoperatively because of dynamic pulmonary artery (PA) obstruction at the anastomotic site of PA. Obstruction at the site of PA anastomosis due to torsion or redundancy of the donor or recipient PA is a rare but treatable cause of postoperative RV failure. In this case, rapid identification of the etiology of RV failure and implementation of corrective therapies before the development of end-organ dysfunction, resulted in complete RV recovery and normal allograft function. This case represents the first known report of dynamic PA anastomoticobstruction resulting in RV failure after HT that was corrected with pulmonary arterioplasty, and RV assist device resulting in complete recovery.
