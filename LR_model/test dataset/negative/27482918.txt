The Paradox of Waiting for Heart Transplant: Between Control and Fate. Understanding a patient's perspective has received increased attention. Awaiting heart transplant remains a great challenge, not only for patients and their families but also for health professionals. This particular challenge has multiple aspects, the most important being the psychological one. Understanding candidates for heart transplant is vital for all caregivers. In this study, our aim was to present the individual's experience of awaiting heart transplant. Structured interviews and the Pictorial Representation of Illness and Self Measure, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Illness Cognition Questionnaire, and the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised measurements were performed in 2 male patients (60 and 61 years old) who were on heart transplant wait list. The patients expressed their concerns and perceived severe consequences of heart disease. They also demonstrated the importance of significant others and hope. The results suggest the existence of realistic cognitive pictures of the disease. The patients revealed high sense of control along with the awareness of being dependent on fate. The lack of severe anxiety and depressive symptoms along with high perceived benefits' scores suggest the existence of an adaptation process. Awaiting heart transplant appears to be a multidimensional phenomenon. The paradoxic configuration of a high sense of control along with the awareness of being dependent on fate was apparent. Significant others and hope seem to be of great importance. The Pictorial Representation of Illness and Self Measure allows a better understanding of a patient's perspective and allows the patient to share personal views. The individual approach provides opportunities that go far beyond routine clinical assessment.
