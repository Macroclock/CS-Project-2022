Pulmonary hypertension: Barrier or just a bump in the road in transplanting adults with congenital heart disease. Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of death in adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD). Identification of disease progression and timing of referral for advanced therapies is often delayed. However, increased awareness and understanding of ACHD and improvements in the approach to treatment have led to improved outcomes. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common barrier to HT. In ACHD, the approach to PH and HT is quite complicated, given the anatomic heterogeneity and lower prevalence and experience. However, in some cases, PH is a result of elevated systemic filling pressures and low output. We describe the approach used to successfully transplant an ACHD patient with severe pre-HT PH performing HT alone. We review the literature and describe the one patient's journey from primarily palliative, to a combined heart-lung transplant candidate, to successful HT patient. We discuss the methodology used to successfully transplant a patient, with significantly elevated pulmonary pressures and an initial pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) > 13 Wood units. There are a number of complexities associated with the ACHD population and it is of utmost importance to carefully identify the underlying hemodynamic milieu and inform the appropriate treatment course in order to have successful transplant outcomes.
