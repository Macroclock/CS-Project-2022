Repeat organ transplantation in the United States, 1996-2005. The prospect of graft loss is a problem faced by all transplant recipients, and retransplantation is often an option when loss occurs. To assess current trends in retransplantation, we analyzed data for retransplant candidates and recipients over the last 10 years, as well as current outcomes. During 2005, retransplant candidates represented 13.5%, 7.9%, 4.1% and 5.5% of all newly registered kidney, liver, heart and lung candidates, respectively. At the end of 2005, candidates for retransplantation accounted for 15.3% of kidney transplant candidates, and lower proportions of liver (5.1%), heart (5.3%) and lung (3.3%) candidates. Retransplants represented 12.4% of kidney, 9.0% of liver, 4.7% of heart and 5.3% of lung transplants performed in 2005. The absolute number of retransplants has grown most notably in kidney transplantation, increasing 40% over the last 10 years; the relative growth of retransplantation was most marked in heart and lung transplantation, increasing 66% and 217%, respectively. The growth of liver retransplantation was only 11%. Unadjusted graft survival remains significantly lower after retransplantation in the most recent cohorts analyzed. Even with careful case mix adjustments, the risk of graft failure following retransplantation is significantly higher than that observed for primary transplants.
