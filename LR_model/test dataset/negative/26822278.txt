Donor-derived exosomes induce specific regulatory T cells to suppress immune inflammation in the allograft heart. To inhibit the immune inflammation in the allografts can be beneficial to organ transplantation. This study aims to induce the donor antigen specific regulatory T cells (Treg cell) inhibit the immune inflammation in the allograft heart. In this study, peripheral exosomes were purified from the mouse serum. A heart transplantation mouse model was developed. The immune inflammation of the allograft heart was assessed by histology and flow cytometry. The results showed that the donor antigen-specific T helper (Th)2 pattern inflammation was observed in the allograft hearts; the inflammation was inhibited by immunizing the recipient mice with the donor-derived exosomes. Purified peripheral exosomes contained integrin MMP1a; the latter induced CD4(+) T cells to express Fork head protein-3 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î² via inhibiting the Th2 transcription factor, GATA binding protein 3, in CD4(+) T cells. Administration with the donor-derived exosomes significantly prolonged the allograft heart survival. We conclude that the donor-derived peripheral exosomes have the capacity to inhibit the immune inflammation in the allograft heart via inducing specific Treg cells, implicating that administration with the donor-derived exosomes may be beneficial to cardiac transplantation.
