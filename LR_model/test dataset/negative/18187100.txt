Right-to-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale left open in the management of acute right heart failure after heart transplantation.

Various treatment modalities have been used in the management of pulmonary hypertension in the peri-operative period. We report a case of successful management of acute right heart failure after orthotopic heart transplantation by decompression of the right ventricle through the patent foramen ovale of the donor heart and inhalation of iloprost.
