Overview of tacrolimus-based immunosuppression after heart or lung transplantation. Transplantation has evolved into an accepted treatment for end-stage heart or lung disease. Acute rejection, complications related to immunosuppressive protocols, and the development of chronic rejection continue to challenge the long-term success of heart and lung transplantations. Wide acceptance of tacrolimus as an important immunosuppressant in renal and hepatic transplantations has led subsequently to its investigation as primary immunosuppression in heart and lung transplant recipients, either combined with azathioprine or with the newer agents mycophenolate mofetil or rapamycin. Studies have shown that tacrolimus is an effective therapeutic alternative to cyclosporine for primary immunosuppression in heart or lung transplantation and demonstrates equivalent if not improved prophylaxis of acute rejection, and more recently demonstrates a potential influence on chronic rejection, particularly in lung transplant recipients. Of importance, the enhanced immunosuppressive activity of tacrolimus is achieved without increased risk of infection or malignancy. Differences in tolerability profiles and side effects between tacrolimus and cyclosporine may be used in selecting the optimal immunotherapy after thoracic transplantation. In particular, the lesser propensity of tacrolimus to cause hypertension and hyperlipidemia potentially offers decreased cardiovascular risk for heart and lung transplant recipients.
