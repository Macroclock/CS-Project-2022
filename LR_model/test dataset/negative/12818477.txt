Relationships between hemodynamic parameters and myocardial energy and antioxidant status in heart transplantation. The relationships between high-energy phosphate levels, oxidative insult and mechanical function represent a key point in heart transplantation and related post-ischemic functional recovery. We evaluated myocardial purine compounds and glutathione antioxidant defence mechanism during 19 heart transplant operations. Heart biopsies were taken before harvesting on beating heart (t1), at the end of cold static preservation (t2) and 30 min after implantation and reperfusion (t3); perchloric extracts of the tissue were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (CE). Correlation analyses were performed with hemodynamic parameters evaluated 90 min after aortic declamping (T90), 6 h following admission in intensive care unit (T6A) and 1 d post-operation (D1). We evidenced that AMP levels measured at T1 negatively correlate with both cardiac index (CI) and oxygen delivery index (DO2I) evaluated at T6A, respectively. The same behavior was evident plotting IMP levels measured at T3 with CI and DO2I evaluated at D1. After t2 the nucleotide/(nucleoside + base) ratio was in positive correlation with hemodynamic parameters at T6A. Energy charge and GSH/GSSG ratio measured before harvesting were in positive correlation with DO2I evaluated at T90. The present research shows that despite the complexity of the high-energy phosphate metabolism and that of the events associated to a clinical heart transplantation, there are some parameters that, besides reflecting the degree of myocardial preservation, also represents predictive parameters for the following organ functional recovery. It also suggests that heart preservation strategies should carefully take into account the sub-optimal nature of the donor heart at the time of procurement, through a broad spectrum of purine compound and glutathione antioxidant system measurements.
