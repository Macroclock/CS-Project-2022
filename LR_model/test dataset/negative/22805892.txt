Mechanical circulatory support in children: bridge to transplant versus recovery. The number of children and adolescents suffering from heart failure is increasing dramatically. Some of these patients will progress to need advanced therapies in the form of mechanical circulatory support (MCS). Over the past few years, increased attention has been focused on clinical use of existing devices as well the development of pediatric-specific ventricular assist devices (VADs). As in adult populations, these devices offer unique opportunities to successfully support children as a bridge-to-transplant, but increasing data suggest that bridge-to-recovery and bridge-to-destination are also viable options in select pediatric populations. Herein, we will review existing approaches as well describe future potential MCS options.
