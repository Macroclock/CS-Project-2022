Percutaneous RVAD with the Protek Duo for severe right ventricular primary graft dysfunction after heart transplant. Right ventricular primary graft dysfunction after heart transplant is a serious life-threatening condition. The severe form, refractory to maximal medical therapy, has traditionally required temporary mechanical support through veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or central right ventricular support. The Protek Duo is a dual lumen cannula recently introduced in the market, which allows for the institution of a percutaneous right ventricular support. We present the first promising case series of the use of this novel support in patients with right ventricular primary graft dysfunction after heart transplant.
