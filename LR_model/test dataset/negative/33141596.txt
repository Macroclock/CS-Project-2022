Minimally invasive single-incision temporary biventricular assist device. New short-term devices have been developed to allow percutaneous insertion. However, in some cases, open insertion becomes necessary. Less invasive insertion of short-term devices has been described previously, using two incisions. We present the case of a patient who underwent minimally invasive insertion of a biventricular device, using a single incision.
