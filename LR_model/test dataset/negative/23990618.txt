CentriMag short-term ventricular assist as a bridge to solution in patients with advanced heart failure: use beyond 30 days. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) offer very valuable therapeutic options for patients with advanced heart failure. CentriMag (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA, USA) is an extracorporeal short-term circulatory assist device Conformité Européenne-marked in Europe for use up to 30 days. Retrospective analysis of 41 patients with advanced heart failure who, from 2003 to 2011, were supported with CentriMag for >30 days as a bridge to recovery, long-term VAD or transplantation. Forty-one adult patients were supported with 46 CentriMag devices for a total of 2695 days with a mean support time of 59 (range: 31-167) days. Indications were post-cardiotomy cardiogenic shock (PC = 4), primary graft failure (PGF = 7) and refractory heart failure (RHF = 35). Six devices were used to support the left ventricle, 19 to support the right ventricle and 21 to support both the ventricles (biventricular support considered as single device unit). In the PC cohort, 3 (75%) patients were weaned from support, while 4 (57%) were weaned from support in the PGF cohort. In the RHF cohort, 8 patients were bridged to long-term VAD and 5 were bridged to transplantation; heart function recovered and device explanted in 14, while 8 patients died on support. There were no device failures. Overall, 34 (74%) patients were recovered or bridged, with a 1-year survival of 54%. CentriMag proved to be a versatile, safe and effective short-term circulatory support for patients with advanced heart failure as a bridge to solution. Its use over 30 days is associated with acceptable survival and does not increase device-related complications. 'CentriMag', 'End-stage heart failure', 'Ventricular assist device'
