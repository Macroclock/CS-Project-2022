Comparison of the efficacy and safety of Consupren solution and Sandimmun Neoral solution, 50 ml in stable heart transplant patients. Cyclosporine A (CyA) is a standard component of immunosuppressive regimen after heart transplantation in most centres. The widespread clinical use of cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive regimens since 1983 has led to significant improvements in the survival of cardiac allograft recipients due to decreased mortality from infections and rejections. (1-3) CyA has been shown to be safe and effective. Owing to its success when used after the heart transplantation the number of patients has also risen. This caused growing financial demands on health insurance companies in the Czech Republic where the immunosuppressive drugs are fully reimbursed. A prospective randomized study in 11 stable heart transplant patients was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of Consupren (IVAX-CR) a Sandimmun Neoral (Novartis) solution based immunosuppressive regimen. The results suggest that Consupren solution can be used as an alternative treatment to Sandimmun Neoral in CyA based regimen.
