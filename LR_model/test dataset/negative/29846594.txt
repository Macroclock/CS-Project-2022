Use of durable mechanical circulatory support on outcomes of heart-kidney transplantation. Previous studies have demonstrated that preheart transplant mechanical circulatory support (MCS) can lead to a small but significant increase in mortality. However, data on outcomes of patients with MCS who require simultaneous heart-kidney transplant are limited. A retrospective review of simultaneous heart-kidney transplantations (HKTxs) performed at a single institution over a 5-year period was performed. Patients were divided based on the preoperative use of durable MCS. Renal graft-related end points were evaluated, including glomerular filtration rate following transplantation, prevalence of delayed renal graft function and freedom from antibody and cellular-mediated graft rejection. Patient-specific outcomes, including survival and frequency of non-fatal major adverse cardiac events at 1 year, were additionally assessed. During the study period, 50 HKTxs were performed, 14 of which had preoperative MCS. HKTx patients with and without MCS implantations had a similar prevalence of delayed graft function (57.1% vs 50.0%; P = 0.757). A numerical trend was observed towards a reduced glomerular filtration rate 1-month post-transplant in patients without an MCS device (81.2 ± 32.8 vs 64.4 ± 27.5; P = 0.072), but no significant difference was observed at 6 and 12 months. No significant difference was observed on the need for post-transplant renal replacement therapy, non-fatal major adverse cardiac events, freedom from graft rejection and overall survival at 1 year. The use of preoperative MCS in patients undergoing combined HKTx was not found to affect renal graft function post-transplantation and does not seem to be associated with increase in morbidity or mortality.
