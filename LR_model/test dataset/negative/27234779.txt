Case Series: Heart Transplantation After Fontan Operation-Single-Center Experience. Fontan failure (FF) occurs rarely. In patients with Fontan failure, heart transplantation is believed to be the most effective therapy. We review our experience in heart transplantations after the Fontan operation. From July 1987 to December 2014, 4 of 513 patients underwent orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). Among them, 4 were due to FF. We reviewed these 4 cases via retrospective chart review. Clinical history, laboratory data, surgical technique, perioperative variables, and outcomes of long-term follow-up are presented herein. The primary outcomes were hospital mortality, 1-year-survival rate, and 4-year-survival rate. The secondary outcome is the improvement in patients with protein-losing enteropathy. The hospital mortality rate was 0% in the 4 FF patients receiving OHT. No surgically related hemorrhage or infection was observed. The 1-year-survival rate was 100% (n = 4) and the 4-year-survival rate 50% (n = 2). One patient died of posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder. Hypoalbuminemia improved in 1 of 3 patients 4 months after OHT. Despite technical challenges, heart transplantation can be performed successfully in patients with Fontan operation. However, protein-losing enteropathy might not be resolved quickly after heart transplantation.
