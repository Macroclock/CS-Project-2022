A novel 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivative as selective inhibitor of protein kinase C theta prevents allograft rejection in a rat heart transplant model. Protein kinase C theta (PKCθ) plays a critical role in T cell signaling and is an attractive target for the treatment of T cell-mediated diseases such as transplant rejection and autoimmune disease. To identify PKCθ inhibitors, we focused on the 2,6-diamino-3-carbamoyl-5-cyanopyrazine derivative 2, which exhibited moderate PKCθ inhibitory activity. Optimization of 2 identified the 2,4-diamino-5-cyanopyrimidine derivative 16c, which exhibited potent PKCθ inhibitory activity and showed good selectivity against other PKC isozymes. Compound 16c prolonged graft survival in an in vivo rat heterotopic cardiac transplant model. 'Immunosuppressant', 'Protein kinase C theta (PKCθ)', 'Selective'
