Pneumocystis Cytochrome b Mutants Associated With Atovaquone Prophylaxis Failure as the Cause of Pneumocystis Infection Outbreak Among Heart Transplant Recipients. Although trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the more efficient drug for prophylactic and curative treatment of pneumocystosis, atovaquone is considered a second-line prophylactic treatment in immunocompromised patients. Variations in atovaquone absorption and mutant fungi selection after atovaquone exposure have been associated with atovaquone prophylactic failure. We report here a Pneumocystis jirovecii cytochrome b (cyt b) mutation (A144V) associated with such prophylactic failure during a pneumocystosis outbreak among heart transplant recipients. Analyses of clinical data, serum drug dosage, and molecular modeling of the P. jirovecii Rieske-cyt b complex were performed to investigate these prophylactic failures. The cyt b A144V mutation was detected in all infected, heart transplant recipient patients exposed to atovaquone prophylaxis but in none of 11 other immunocompromised, infected control patients not treated with atovaquone. Serum atovaquone concentrations associated with these prophylactic failures were similar than those found in noninfected exposed control patients under a similar prophylactic regimen. Computational modeling of the P. jirovecii Rieske-cyt b complex and in silico mutagenesis indicated that the cyt b A144V mutation might alter the volume of the atovaquone-binding pocket, which could decrease atovaquone binding. These data suggest that the cyt b A144V mutation confers diminished sensitivity to atovaquone, resulting in spread of Pneumocystis pneumonia among heart transplant recipients submitted to atovaquone prophylaxis. Potential selection and interhuman transmission of resistant P. jirovecii strain during atovaquone prophylactic treatment has to be considered and could limit its extended large-scale use in immucompromised patients.
