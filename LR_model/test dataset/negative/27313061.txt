Pregnancy in cardiac transplant recipients. Successful pregnancy following cardiac transplantation has been described, although outcome data from individual centers are relatively sparse. We investigated maternal and fetal outcomes including change in left ventricular (LV) function and calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) dose in women who became pregnant from our institution. We identified every female patient <49 years at the time of transplant who survived >3 months post-surgery, between 1985 and 2014. Those who conceived had a review of their medical records and transplant charts. Those currently alive were interviewed. There were 22 pregnancies in 17 women with 20 live births (91%). Mean time from transplantation was 98±62.4 months. Rejection complicated one pregnancy, and LV function remained normal in all others. Hypertension complicated 3 (13.6%), preeclampsia 3 (13.6%), and cholestasis 1 (4.5%). Mean birthweight was 2447±608 grams at 34.1±3.6 weeks. Four women died following pregnancy. A significant increase in total daily dose of tacrolimus and cyclosporine A was required to maintain therapeutic levels through pregnancy (CyA, P<.001; and Tac, P=.001), with no deterioration in serum creatinine. We report a 91% live birth rate post-cardiac transplantation. Meticulous individualized care with frequent monitoring of CNI levels and LV function is necessary to optimize the maternal and fetal outcomes.
