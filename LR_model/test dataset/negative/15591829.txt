Processing of cardiovascular allografts: effectiveness of European Homograft Bank (EHB) antimicrobial treatment (cool decontamination protocol with low concentration of antibiotics). To assess the effectiveness of antimicrobial treatment by using cool decontamination protocol with low concentration of antibiotics during processing of cardiovascular allografts, 948 allografts processed during a 2-year period were analysed. Five hundred and fourty one donors aged <62 years were classified in: multiorgan donors (MOD) with non-transplantable hearts; recipients of cardiac transplantation (RHT); and non-beating heart cadavers with a warm ischemic time of less than 6 h (NBHD). During processing three samples for bacteriology testing were taken A (sampling before decontamination); B (sampling after decontamination); C (sampling on the final product). Samples A were positive in 348 cases (36.4%), respectively 36% for MOD, 21.6% for RHT and 78.1% for NBHD. All the allografts were immersed in a cocktail of four antibiotics at 4 degrees C. After exposure to antibiotics the rate of decontamination of those with A positive was 90.4, 92.5, 82.5% respectively for MOD, RHT, NBHD. At the end of processing, 57 allografts (6%) were positive in B and/or C, 15 allografts remained contaminated with the same bacteria as in A, 42 were contaminated during processing. The overall rate of sterility in the end of processing is 94% and for each group this is: 95.4% for MOD, 96.8% for RHT and 86.3% for NBHD. Analysis shows that there is no influence of time of exposure in AB in the rate of decontamination for MOD and RHT. The most predominant germ in contamination is Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (CNS) (53.4% alone, 8.9% with other bacteria). 83.3% of MOD; 88.5% of RHT were contaminated with one germ, while 40.4% of NBHD were contaminated with more than one.
