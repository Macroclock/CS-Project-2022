Transplantation of purified iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes in myocardial infarction. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) can be differentiated into cardiomyocytes and represent a possible autologous cell source for myocardial repair. We analyzed the engraftment and functional effects of murine iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) in a murine model of myocardial infarction. To maximize cardiomyocyte yield and purity a genetic purification protocol was applied. Murine iPSCs were genetically modified to express a Zeocin™ resistance gene under control of the cardiac-specific α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC, MYH6) promoter. Thus, CM selection was performed during in vitro differentiation. iPSC-CM aggregates ("cardiac bodies", CBs) were transplanted on day 14 after LAD ligation into the hearts of previously LAD-ligated mice (800 CBs/animal; 2-3x106 CMs). Animals were treated with placebo (PBS, n = 14) or iPSC-CMs (n = 35). Myocardial remodeling and function were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), conductance catheter (CC) analysis and histological morphometry. In vitro and in vivo differentiation was investigated. Follow up was 28 days (including histological assessment and functional analysis). iPSC-CM purity was >99%. Transplanted iPSC-CMs formed mature grafts within the myocardium, expressed cardiac markers and exhibited sarcomeric structures. Intramyocardial transplantation of iPSC-CMs significantly improved myocardial remodeling and left ventricular function 28 days after LAD-ligation. We conclude that iPSCs can effectively be differentiated into cardiomyocytes and genetically enriched to high purity. iPSC derived cardiomyocytes engraft within the myocardium of LAD-ligated mice and contribute to improve left ventricular function.
