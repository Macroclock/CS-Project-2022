Hypothermic, oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) provides cardioprotection via succinate oxidation prior to normothermic perfusion in a rat model of donation after circulatory death (DCD). In donation after circulatory death (DCD), cardiac grafts are subjected to warm ischemia in situ, prior to a brief period of cold, static storage (CSS) at procurement, and ex situ, normothermic, machine perfusion (NMP) for transport and graft evaluation. Cold ischemia and normothermic reoxygenation during NMP could aggravate graft injury through continued accumulation and oxidation, respectively, of mitochondrial succinate, and the resultant oxidative stress. We hypothesized that replacing CSS with hypothermic, oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) could provide cardioprotection by reducing cardiac succinate levels before NMP. DCD was simulated in male Wistar rats. Following 21 minutes in situ ischemia, explanted hearts underwent 30 minutes hypothermic storage with 1 of the following: (1) CSS, (2) HOPE, (3) hypothermic deoxygenated perfusion (HNPE), or (4) HOPE + AA5 (succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor) followed by normothermic reperfusion to measure cardiac and metabolic recovery. After hypothermic storage, tissue ATP/ADP levels were higher and succinate concentration was lower in HOPE vs CSS, HNPE, and HOPE + AA5 hearts. After 60 minutes reperfusion, cardiac function was increased and cellular injury was decreased in HOPE compared with CSS, HNPE, and HOPE + AA5 hearts. HOPE provides improved cardioprotection via succinate oxidation prior to normothermic reperfusion compared with CSS, and therefore is a promising strategy for preservation of cardiac grafts obtained with DCD.
