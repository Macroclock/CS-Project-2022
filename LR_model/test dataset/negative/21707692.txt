CD44/CD70 blockade and anti-CD154/LFA-1 treatment synergistically suppress accelerated rejection and prolong cardiac allograft survival in mice. Current treatments that are efficient in controlling effector T cell responses to allografts have limited efficacy on the accelerated rejection mediated by memory T cells. Effective targeting of alloreactive memory T cells may therefore be explored to improve therapeutic approaches towards solving this problem. In this study, we investigated the synergistic effect of CD44/CD70 blockade and anti-CD154/LFA-1 treatment on the accelerated rejection mediated by memory T cells. While CD44/CD70 blockade had limited effects on the alloresponses of effector T cells in vivo, it diminished the expansion of both CD4(+)  and CD8(+)  memory T cells in recipients adoptively transferred with donor-sensitized T cells. In combination with anti-CD154/LFA-1 treatment, CD44/CD70 blockade significantly prolonged cardiac allograft survival in adoptive transfer recipients. We demonstrated that treatment with the combination of all four antibodies (anti-CD154/LFA-1/CD44/CD70) inhibited accelerated rejection by markedly suppressing the alloresponses of effector and memory T cells and reducing the number of graft-infiltration lymphocytes in adoptive transfer recipients. Meanwhile, CD44/CD70 blockade and anti-CD154/LFA-1 treatment synergically enhanced regulatory T cells (Tregs) by increasing the proportion of splenic Tregs and the expression of IL-10 in these recipients. Our findings contribute to the potential design of therapies for accelerated allograft rejection.
