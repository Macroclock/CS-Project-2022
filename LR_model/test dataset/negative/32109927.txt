Arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in post-cardiac transplant patients. Orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) significantly improves morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage heart disease. Despite advances in surgical technique, immunosuppressive therapies, and patient monitoring, long-term risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the denervated heart remains unchanged. SCD is responsible for approximately 10% of all posttransplant deaths with a pooled incidence rate of 1.30 per 100 person years and is strongly associated with cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). Risk factors for SCD and CAV include higher donor age, younger recipient age, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Little is known about the time course between CAV and SCD. Although some registry data establish ventricular fibrillation as a documented terminal rhythm, the arrhythmia may not be the mechanism of SCD. In this review, we identify risk factors and general independent predictors of arrhythmia and SCD and discuss the utility of implantable cardiac defibrillators in post-cardiac transplant patients.
