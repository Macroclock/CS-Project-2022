An exploratory study of the cognitive, academic, and behavioral functioning of pediatric cardiothoracic transplant recipients. Limited information is available regarding the cognitive, academic, and behavioral outcomes of pediatric cardiothoracic transplant recipients. To examine the cognitive, behavioral, and academic functioning of a group of children who have received heart, heart/lung, or lung transplants. An exploratory cross-sectional outcomes study of surviving pediatric cardiothoracic transplant recipients at a Midwestern pediatric hospital. Transplant recipients completed measures of cognitive and academic functioning. Parents and teachers completed measures of behavioral functioning. Parents and transplant recipients also provided qualitative data regarding their main concerns after transplantation. On measures of cognitive functioning, 46% showed significant delays (> 2 SD below the normative population). Of those eligible for academic testing, 78% fell within the average range (within 1 SD of the normative population) for reading and spelling, and 57% fell within the average range for math. Twenty-seven percent of mothers, 11% of fathers, and 17% of teachers rated subjects as having significant behavioral concerns. Results highlight the need for close contact between transplant teams and school personnel to optimize outcomes. In addition, patients and families may benefit from psychological intervention after transplantation as there are ongoing concerns regarding life expectancy and quality of life.
