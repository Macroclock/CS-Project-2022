Peritransplant Cardiometabolic and Mitochondrial Function: The Missing Piece in Donor Heart Dysfunction and Graft Failure. Primary graft dysfunction is an important cause of morbidity and mortality after cardiac transplantation. Donor brain stem death (BSD) is a significant contributor to donor heart dysfunction and primary graft dysfunction. There remain substantial gaps in the mechanistic understanding of peritransplant cardiac dysfunction. One of these gaps is cardiac metabolism and metabolic function. The healthy heart is an "omnivore," capable of utilizing multiple sources of nutrients to fuel its enormous energetic demand. When this fails, metabolic inflexibility leads to myocardial dysfunction. Data have hinted at metabolic disturbance in the BSD donor and subsequent heart transplantation; however, there is limited evidence demonstrating specific metabolic or mitochondrial dysfunction. This review will examine the literature surrounding cardiometabolic and mitochondrial function in the BSD donor, organ preservation, and subsequent cardiac transplantation. A more comprehensive understanding of this subject may then help to identify important cardioprotective strategies to improve the number and quality of donor hearts.
