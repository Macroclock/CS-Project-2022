Feasibility of Assessing Adolescent and Young Adult Heart Transplant Recipient Mental Health and Resilience Using Patient-Reported Outcome Measures. Although adolescents and young adults may be particularly prone to mental health symptoms after heart transplant, screening practices are variable. To assess the feasibility of using patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures to assess mental health, functional status, and resiliency in posttransplant adolescents and young adult patients. Patients transplanted between ages 15 and 25 years at 3 centers completed 6 PRO instruments via web-based platforms: PROMIS instruments for anxiety, depression, satisfaction with social roles, and physical functioning; the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, version 5; and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10. Feasibility (completion, time to completion, and measure missingness) and PRO results were described and compared between patients with congenital heart disease and cardiomyopathy. Nineteen patients (median age at transplant 17.7 y [interquartile range 16.3, 19.2 y], 84% male) were enrolled at an average of 3 ± 1.8 years after transplant. Enrollment was 90% among eligible patients. Measure missingness was zero. The average completion time was 12 ± 15 minutes for all instruments. Timely PRO completion was facilitated by in-clinic application. The PRO results indicated that 9 patients (47%) had at least mild posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (≥11 points on Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, version 5). Among them, 4 patients had scores >28 suggestive of probable posttraumatic stress disorder. Two (11%) and 6 (32%) patients had anxious and depressive symptoms, respectively. The cardiomyopathy cohort had a higher median Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, version 5 score than that of the congenital heart disease subgroup (11.0 vs 6.0; P = 0.015). Twelve (63%) had resiliency scores that were lower than the population average. No significant differences were found in PRO results between patients with cardiomyopathy and congenital heart disease apart from the posttraumatic stress disorder assessment. This novel PRO-based approach to psychiatric screening of adolescents and young adult patients after transplant appears feasible for assessing mental health, functional status, and resiliency, with excellent enrollment and completion rates. These instruments characterized the burden of mental health symptoms within this adolescents and young adult heart transplant cohort, with a high prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Resiliency scores were lower than in a comparison population. Electronically-administered PRO administration could facilitate more consistent mental health screening in this at-risk group.
