Identification of the immunological profile in rejection-free heart transplantation. Tolerance induction following organ transplantation can be achieved by adoptive cell transfer of regulatory T-cells (T Blood samples of long-term rejection-free HTx patients (LT-HTx, n = 20) and patients on the HTx waiting list (pre-HTx, n = 20) were compared. Flow cytometric and multiplex analyses of DCs, T Plasmacytoid DCs expressing blood DC antigen (BDCA) 2 and BDCA4 were significantly increased in LT-HTx patients (BDCA2 In conclusion, we defined the immune status of pre-HTx patients and the target immunological profile of LT-HTx patients. These data may help to establish a monitoring tool that is based on a multiparametric dataset. 'Dendritic cells', 'Flow cytometry', 'Heart transplantation', 'Regulatory T-cells', 'Tolerance induction'
