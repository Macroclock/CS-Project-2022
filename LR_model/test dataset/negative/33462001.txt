Profound diarrhoea and weight loss in an immunocompromised patient. A 75-year-old man was admitted with a 3-month history of worsening diarrhoea and weight loss. He was on long-term immunosuppression following cardiac transplantation. Investigations revealed herpes simplex oesophagitis and stool samples were positive for norovirus. Treatment with acyclovir and nitazoxanide resulted in a complete resolution of symptoms. Norovirus is a common cause of infectious gastroenteritis, but immunosuppressed patients may present with chronic diarrhoea rather than an acute illness. This case highlights the importance of a low clinical threshold for testing for norovirus infection in immunocompromised patients.
