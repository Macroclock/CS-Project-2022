Improving acute cardiac transplantation rejection therapy using ultrasound-targeted FK506-loaded microbubbles in rats. Targeted delivery of immunosuppressants to allografts can increase the concentrations of drugs in pathological tissues, improve therapeutic effects and reduce unfavorable side effects. Therefore, we synthesized FK506-loaded microbubbles (FK506-MBs) for site-specific release of FK506 into transplanted hearts by the ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) technique. The average particle size of FK506-MBs was 1.65 ± 0.32 μm and they had high drug loading and encapsulation efficiency. The in vivo drug concentration in transplanted hearts that were treated with FK506-MBs plus UTMD was about 1.64-fold higher than that in grafts that received free FK506 at the same dosage. The degree of graft rejection in the FK506-MB plus UTMD group was lower than those of other groups. Both infiltration of T cells and secretion of inflammatory cytokines were significantly reduced in the FK506-MB plus UTMD group. More importantly, the mean survival time of the grafts was significantly longer (16.00 ± 0.89 day) than those of the PBS group (6.66 ± 1.36 day) and the FK506 group (12.83 ± 1.17 day). In addition, we also found that the concentration of FK506 in whole blood was lower in the FK506-MB plus UTMD group than that in the FK506 group, which would be beneficial for reducing the side effects. Hence, our results showed that combining FK506-MBs with UTMD was an effective strategy to deliver FK506 to transplanted hearts, which can increase the local drug concentration and enhance its efficacy on rejection. Ultrasound-targeted drug release is safe and radiation-free, with great potential for clinical transformation, and could also be extended to the treatment of other graft rejection cases, such as liver transplantation, kidney transplantation and so on.
