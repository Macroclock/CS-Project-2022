Risk Stratification for Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy in Heart Transplant Recipients - Annual Intravascular Ultrasound Evaluation. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) limits long-term success after heart transplant. We assessed the post-transplant risk factors for CAV development. Patients who underwent heart transplant between May 1999 and December 2013 were included in this study. Patients (n=54) were divided into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of CAV progression after transplant. Coronary angiogram and intravascular ultrasound were conducted within 5-11 weeks after transplant, at 12 months, and annually thereafter. Scheduled endomyocardial biopsies were performed after transplant or whenever acute cellular rejection (ACR) or antibody-mediated rejection was suspected. Twenty-five of 54 patients (46.2%) had CAV progression. ACR ≥ International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade 2 (ACR ≥ 2) and donor age >50 years were significantly associated with CAV development compared with ACR <2 and donor age <50 years. Patients with no history of ACR ≥ 2 and donor age ≤50 years had a significantly low risk of developing CAV compared with the other groups. Donor age and history of ACR ≥ 2 are independent risk factors for CAV development. Identifying patients at risk of developing CAV is important for appropriate direction of resources and intensity of follow-up.
