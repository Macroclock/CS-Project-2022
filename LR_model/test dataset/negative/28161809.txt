Alteration of Cardiac Deformation in Acute Rejection in Pediatric Heart Transplant Recipients. The objective of this study is to assess changes in cardiac deformation during acute cellular- and antibody-mediated rejection in pediatric HT recipients. Pediatric HT recipients aged ≤18 years with at least one episode of biopsy-diagnosed rejection from 2006 to 2013 were included. Left ventricular systolic S (SS) and SR (SSr) data were acquired using 2D speckle tracking on echocardiograms obtained within 12 h of right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. A mixed effect model was used to compare cardiac deformation during CR (Grade ≥ 1R), AMR (pAMR ≥ 2), and mixed rejection (CR and AMR positive) versus no rejection (Grade 0R and pAMR 0 or 1). A total of 20 subjects (10 males, 50%) with 71 rejection events (CR 35, 49%; AMR 21, 30% and mixed 15, 21%) met inclusion criteria. The median time from HT to first biopsy used for analysis was 5 months (IQR 0.25-192 months). Average LV longitudinal SS and SSr were reduced significantly during rejection (SS: -17.2 ± 3.4% vs. -10.7 ± 4.5%, p < 0.001 and SSr: -1.2 ± 0.2 s 'Pediatric heart transplant', 'Rejection', 'Systolic strain', 'Systolic strain rate'
