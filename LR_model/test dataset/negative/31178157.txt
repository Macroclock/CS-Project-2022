Impact of the Opioid Epidemic on Heart Transplantation: Donor Characteristics and Organ Discard. The national opioid epidemic has expanded the donor pool for heart transplantation, but concerns remain regarding infectious risk and allograft function. This study compared donor and recipient characteristics, outcomes, and reasons for organ discard between overdose-death donors (ODDs) and donors with all other mechanism of death. Data on adult cardiac transplants from 2010 to 2017 were provided by the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. Cardiac allografts used in multiple organ transplantations were excluded. Recipient and donor characteristics and organ discard were analyzed with regard to ODDs. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests described mortality survival. A total of 1,710 of 15,904 (10.8%) cardiac transplantations were from ODDs, approximately a 10-fold increase from 2000 (1.2%). ODDs were more frequently older than 40 years of age (87.2% vs 70.1%; p < 0.001), had higher rates of substance abuse, were more likely hepatitis C positive (1.3% vs 0.2%; p < 0.001), and less frequently required inotropic support at the time of procurement (38.4% vs 44.8%; p < 0.001). Overall survival was not different between the groups (p = 0.066). Discarded ODD allografts were more likely to be hepatitis C positive (30.8% vs 5.3%; p < 0.001) and to be identified as conveying increased risk by the Public Health Services (63.3% vs 13.2%; p < 0.001), but they were less likely to be discarded because of a diseased organ state (28.2% vs 36.1%; p < 0.001). Rates of ODDs have increased corresponding with the worsening opioid epidemic. Even though ODDs have higher rates of hepatitis C, cardiac allograft quality indices are favorable, and recipient outcomes are similar when compared with non-ODDs, a finding indicating that greater use of this donor pool may be appropriate.
