HeartWare and HeartMate II left ventricular assist devices as bridge to transplantation: a comparative analysis. The purpose of this study is to comparatively analyze outcomes of heart transplant patients bridged to transplantation with HeartWare (HW-VAD) versus HeartMate II (HMII-VAD) left ventricular assist devices. The United Network for Organ Sharing Database was reviewed to identify first-time heart transplant recipients who were bridged to transplantation with either HW-VAD (n=141) or HMII-VAD (n=1824) from January 2009 through July 2012. Recipients of HW-VAD had a higher proportion of female patients (27.0% versus 18.9%; p=0.019), a lower body surface area (2.01±0.25 m2 versus 2.06±0.25 m2; p=0.035), and a trend toward a higher peak percentage of panel reactive antibody against human leukocyte class I antigens (40.4%±32.8% versus 33.0%±30.4%; p=0.070). Pretransplantation recipient cardiac index (2.33±0.66 L⋅min(-1)⋅m(-2) versus 2.33±0.68 L⋅min(-1)⋅m(-2)), serum creatinine (1.21±0.43 mg/dL versus 1.26±0.57 mg/dL), and total bilirubin (1.34±3.45 mg/dL versus 1.06±1.84 mg/dL) were comparable between the two groups (p>0.05 for all comparisons). After transplantation, there were no significant differences in freedom from rejection or freedom from cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Posttransplant graft survival rates were similar between the HW-VAD group and the HMII-VAD group at 1, 2, and 3 years (88.4% versus 87.8%, 79.9% versus 83.8%, and 77.4% versus 79.9%, respectively; p=0.843). These findings suggest similar hemodynamic unloading, pretransplant end-organ function, and posttransplant outcomes in patients bridged to transplantation with both the HW-VAD and HMII-VAD. '27', '34'
