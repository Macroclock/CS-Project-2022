Endocan Concentration and Chronic Inflammatory Process Among Heart Transplant Recipients. Endocan is a novel soluble dermatan sulfate proteoglycan derived from endothelium. It has the capacity of binding to different biologically active molecules associated with cellular signaling, adhesion, and regulating proliferation, differentiation, migration, and adhesion of different cell types in health and pathology. Its elevated level is connected with endothelial activation, neovascularization, and inflammation or carcinogenesis. The level of serum endocan among 131 heart transplant recipients on 3-drug immunosuppression (calcineurin inhibitor, mycophenolate mofetil/mycophenolic acid, steroid) in correlation with other markers of endothelial damage was determined. In addition, 22 healthy volunteers were studied. In cross-sectional study, markers were measured with the use of commercially available assays of endothelial damage-endocan and von Willebrand factor (VWF)-inflammation-high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin (IL) 6-and kidney function-cystatin C. The endocan, VWF, IL-6, hsCRP, and cystatin C levels were significantly higher in heart transplant recipients compared with healthy volunteers. In our cohort, endocan level was correlated with renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate: r = -0.21; P < .05), creatinine (r = 0.21; P < .05), erythrocyte count (r = -0.24; P < .01), hemoglobin (r = -0.33; P < .01), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (r = 0.25; P < .01), cholesterol (r = -0.22; P < .05), LDL (r = -0.21; P < .05), New York Heart Association functional class (r = 0.21; P < .05), hsCRP (r = 0.32; P < .01), IL-6 (r = 0.31; P < .01), and VWF (r = 0.27; P < .01). In multifactorial analysis, the predictors of endocan levels were cholesterol level, cystatin C, and IL-6, predicting 54% of variability. Endocan concentration among heart transplant recipients is potentially connected with endothelial damage caused by subclinical inflammation resulting from hyperlipidemia.
