The xenoantibody response and immunoglobulin gene expression profile of cynomolgus monkeys transplanted with hDAF-transgenic porcine hearts. Recent work has indicated a role for anti-Gal alpha 1-3Gal (Gal) and anti-non-Gal xenoantibodies in the primate humoral rejection response against human-decay accelerating factor (hDAF) transgenic pig organs. Our laboratory has shown that anti-porcine xenograft antibodies in humans and non-human primates are encoded by a small number of germline IgV(H) progenitors. In this study, we extended our analysis to identify the IgV(H) genes encoding xenoantibodies in immunosuppressed cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) transplanted with hDAF-transgenic pig organs. Three immunosuppressed monkeys underwent heterotopic heart transplantation with hDAF porcine heart xenografts. Two of three animals were given GAS914, a poly-L-lysine derivative shown to bind to anti-Gal xenoantibodies and neutralize them. One animal rejected its heart at post-operative day (POD) 39; a second animal rejected the transplanted heart at POD 78. The third monkey was euthanized on POD 36 but the heart was not rejected. Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and serum were obtained from each animal before and at multiple time points after transplantation. We analyzed the immune response by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to confirm whether anti-Gal or anti-non-Gal xenoantibodies were induced after graft placement. Immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (V(H)) cDNA libraries were then produced and screened. We generated soluble single-chain antibodies (scFv) to establish the binding specificity of the cloned immunoglobulin genes. Despite immunosuppression, which included the use of the polymer GAS914, the two animals that rejected their hearts showed elevated levels of cytotoxic anti-pig red blood cell (RBC) antibodies and anti-pig aortic endothelial cell (PAEC) antibodies. The monkey that did not reject its graft showed a decline in serum anti-RBC, anti-PAEC, and anti-Gal xenoantibodies when compared with pre-transplant levels. A V(H)3 family gene with a high level of sequence similarity to an allele of V(H)3-11, designated V(H)3-11(cyno), was expressed at elevated levels in the monkey that was not given GAS914 and whose graft was not rejected until POD 78. IgM but not IgG xenoantibodies directed at N-acetyl lactosamine (a precursor of the Gal epitope) were also induced in this animal. We produced soluble scFv from this new gene to determine whether this antibody could bind to the Gal carbohydrate, and demonstrated that this protein was capable of blocking the binding of human serum xenoantibody to Gal oligosaccharide, as had previously been shown with human V(H)3-11 scFv. DAF-transgenic organs transplanted into cynomolgus monkeys induce anti-Gal and anti-non-Gal xenoantibody responses mediated by both IgM and IgG xenoantibodies. Anti-non-Gal xenoantibodies are induced at high levels in animals treated with GAS914. Antibodies that bind to the Gal carbohydrate and to N-acetyl lactosamine are induced in the absence of GAS914 treatment. The animal whose heart remained beating for 78 days demonstrated increased usage of an antibody encoded by a germline progenitor that is structurally related, but distinct from IGHV311. This antibody binds to the Gal carbohydrate but does not induce the rapid rejection of the xenograft when expressed at high levels as early as day 8 post-transplantation.
