Extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae infection in heart and lung transplant recipients and in mechanical circulatory support recipients. Extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative bacilli are increasingly reported in patients with a variety of risk factors including prior cephalosporin and antibiotic usage, prolonged hospitalizations, existence of comorbid conditions, and critical illness. Retrospective review of infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was performed in heart transplant (HTx), lung transplant (LTx), and mechanical circulatory support (MCS) device recipients at a large transplant center. Among 1065 patients transplanted/implanted, the incidence of ESBL-related infections (bacteremia, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, central venous catheter-associated infection, and wound infections) in HTx, LTx, and MCS device recipients was reported at 2.2%, 5.5%, and 10.7%, respectively, caused by ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Citrobacter freundii. Early detection and adequate duration of therapy for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in solid organ transplants and MCS device recipients are essential in successful patient outcomes including prevention of recurrent infection.
