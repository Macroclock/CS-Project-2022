Experience of percutaneous coronary intervention in the management of pediatric cardiac allograft vasculopathy. In a retrospective study, we examined the procedural success rate and the short-, intermediate-, and long-term outcomes of coronary interventional procedures in children with cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Seven patients underwent 13 interventional procedures: balloon angioplasty alone (n = 3), angioplasty with stenting (n = 9), or angioplasty with brachytherapy (n = 1), with procedural success in all. Two major complications (cardiac arrest) and a single death occurred in the immediate postprocedural period. Five (83%) of the remaining 6 patients developed moderate to severe restenosis, diffuse disease, or progressive vasculopathy; 3 have been retransplanted, 1 died from progressive cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and 1 is awaiting retransplantation, 40 months after the procedure.
