Post-transplantation body mass index in heart transplant recipients: determinants and consequences. Heart transplantation (HTx) is an important treatment for end-stage chronic heart failure. After HTx, recipients frequently become obese. Gaining weight measured by body mass index (BMI) has been reported as a common phenomenon for patients before and after solid organ transplantation, becoming specifically significant for the long-term follow up after organ transplantation. In the long term following HTx, overweight and obesity may lead to increased risk of cardiovascular complications, developing metabolic syndrome-a topic well documented in previous studies. The aims of this study were to calculate the BMI in patients after HTx with follow up in our center and to assess potential predictors for overweight and obesity as well as their consequences. A complete assessment of the BMI among all available heart transplant (HT) recipients (n = 169) was performed. Data were retrieved from patients' charts. Data were statistically analyzed. The sample mean age was 55.12 ± 13.34 years, mean years since transplantation being 10.70 ± 5.26 years and the majority of study subjects were males (76.33%). Overall BMI was mean 26.33 ± 3.79. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, 32.54% were normal, 46.74% were overweight, and 18.34% were obese. We did not observe a statistical difference between BMI before and after transplantation, between immunosuppressive protocol, and receipt of steroids. We observed an association between BMI and level of fasting glucose (r = 0.35; P < .05) and difference between BMI and gender as well as the presence of cardiovascular diseases. Overweight and obesity after HTx are common and reflect a risk factor for cardiac allograft vasculopathy and other cardiovascular diseases as well as metabolic syndrome among HT recipients.
