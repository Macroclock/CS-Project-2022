In vivo Treg expansion under costimulation blockade targets early rejection and improves long-term outcome. CTLA4Ig has been shown to improve kidney allograft function, but an increased frequency of early rejection episodes poses a major obstacle for more widespread clinical use. The deleterious effect of CTLA4Ig on Treg numbers provides a possible explanation for graft injury. Therefore, we aimed at improving CTLA4Ig's efficacy by therapeutically increasing the number of Tregs. Murine cardiac allograft transplantation (BALB/c  to B6) was performed under CTLA4Ig therapy modeled after the clinically approved dosing regimen and Tregs were transferred early or late after transplant. Neither early nor late Treg transfer prolonged allograft survival. Transferred Tregs were traceable in various lymphoid compartments but only modestly increased overall Treg numbers. Next, we augmented Treg numbers in vivo by means of IL2 complexes. A short course of IL2/anti-IL2-complexes administered before transplantation reversed the CTLA4Ig-mediated decline in Tregs. Of note, the addition of IL2/anti-IL2-complexes to CTLA4Ig therapy substantially prolonged heart allograft survival and significantly improved graft histology on day 100. The depletion of Tregs abrogated this effect and resulted in a significantly diminished allograft survival. The increase in Treg numbers upon IL2 treatment was associated with a decreased expression of B7 on dendritic cells. These results demonstrate that therapy with IL2 complexes improves the efficacy of CTLA4Ig by counterbalancing its unfavorable effect on Tregs.
