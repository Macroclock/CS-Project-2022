Oxidative stress and antioxidant defense systems in patients after heart transplantation. Heart transplantation ranks among those surgical interventions associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury to the donor heart as well as to the recipient. These events are connected with increased production of reactive oxygen species which evoke metabolic, structural and functional disturbances. Twenty-four transplant patients were investigated for oxidative stress (plasma levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS) and antioxidant capacity (plasma total antioxidant status, TAS), and for activities of erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) during the first year after heart transplantation. The post-transplant period was characterized by progressive decrease of plasma TAS, indicating a significant long-term drop of antioxidant reserves in patients after successful heart transplantation. The decrease in plasma TAS is accompanied by long-lasting increase of TBARS levels, which may represent oxidative stress of the organism. We conclude that additional therapy with antioxidant substances should be an important component of the complex therapeutic programme of patients after heart transplantation.
