B-cell tolerance following ABO-incompatible infant heart transplantation. Infant heart transplantation is highly successful therapy for severe congenital heart malformations and cardiomyopathies. However the donor organ shortage is particularly crucial for this age group. We have demonstrated that some aspects of human immaturity can be exploited for infant organ transplantation, allowing safe transplantation of organs that would be "incompatible" in mature individuals, and as a window of continued susceptibility to induction of immunologic tolerance.
