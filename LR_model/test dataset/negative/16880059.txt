The path not taken: social and cultural barriers to thoracic transplantation. Religious beliefs, misperceptions, and distrust of the health care system have been cited as barriers to organ donation or transplantation in minorities. Improved training of hospital staff on donation protocols has been demonstrated to increase consent rates for or-gan donation. Increased interaction of minorities with ethnically appropriate transplant candidates, recipients, and donation or procurement personnel has a positive effect on donor rates. Programs using such practices must be expanded to overcome significant barriers to the transplantation of solid organs. Research into additional ways to improve acceptance of organ transplantation by minorities is needed to increase participation rates.
