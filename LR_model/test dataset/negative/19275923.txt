Lack of significant de novo HLA allosensitization in ventricular assist device recipients transfused with leukoreduced, ABO identical blood products. Ventricular assist devices provide support for a failing heart and often serve as a bridge to transplantation. The use of these devices has also been associated with allosensitization to HLA antigens because of transfusion of blood products. Our program established a protocol mandating the use of leukoreduced, irradiated and ABO identical products, including platelets, in patients receiving initial implantations of VADs as a bridge to transplantation. Recipients were tested for anti-HLA antibodies before VAD implantation and monthly post-implantation by cytotoxicity and solid phase assays. We observed minimal de novo anti-HLA sensitization (<10%) in this population of 55 patients, each receiving a mean of 90 blood components, using this approach. No patient developed broad sensitization (PRA>50%). In conclusion, The use of leukoreduced, irradiated, ABO identical blood products abrogates broad allosensitization in this highly transfused population.
