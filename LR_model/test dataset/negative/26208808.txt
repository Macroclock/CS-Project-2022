[Successful ablation of an atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia ablation 2 years after orthotopic heart transplantation]. We report the case of a 48-year-old woman with an orthotopic heart transplantation. Two years after transplantation, the patient reported intermittent palpitations and dyspnea. The results of the 12-lead electrogram provided suspicion of AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), which was confirmed in the electrophysiological examination. The AVNRT was successfully eliminated without complications by radiofrequency catheter ablation of the slow pathway. The case shows that an AVNRT, even with existing sinus rhythm of the original heart, can also occur on the transplanted heart and ablation is safe and feasible.
