Does the antibody mediated rejection grading scale have prognostic prediction? Yes, but the picture is still blurry. Antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) is a condition difficult to diagnose and treat, which may significantly impair the outcome of heart transplant recipients. In clinical practice, diagnosis is based on immunopathology grading of endomyocardial biopsies (EMB). Despite its value, the current diagnostic system has several pitfalls that have been addressed in recent literature. Pathology grading of ABMR (pAMR) has a relevant prognostic factor. However, it does not capture several nuances, such as chronic vs. acute ABMR, mixed rejection or microvascular inflammation. Molecular biology-based assays are shedding new light on the mechanisms of ABMR, which could improve the precision of ABMR diagnosis. These new findings have the potential to rearrange EMB grading system and to guide more precisely decision-making, but studies validating the therapeutic management based on molecular-pathology coupling are still missing.
