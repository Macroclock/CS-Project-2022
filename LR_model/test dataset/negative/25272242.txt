Donor-transmitted malaria after heart transplant managed successfully with artesunate. Donor-transmitted malaria is a rare complication in solid organ transplantation, which causes high mortality. Data concerning the use of artesunate in solid organ transplant recipients are lacking. We report a heart transplant patient who developed donor-derived severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria, successfully treated with artesunate. Transmission of malaria to 2 of the other transplant recipients from the same donor was also documented.
