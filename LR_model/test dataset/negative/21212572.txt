A case of multiple focal nodular hyperplasia in the liver which developed after heart transplantation. An 18-year-old woman, who had undergone cardiac allograft transplantation, developed continuous back pain two months after surgery. Abdominal computed tomography showed multiple enhanced lesions in her liver, which were not present before transplantation. One tumor bulged from the surface of the liver and compressed the stomach. Partial resection of the liver was performed and her symptoms improved. The pathological diagnosis was focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). To our knowledge, this is the first report of multiple FNH after heart transplantation. Transplant clinicians may need to keep this possibility under consideration following heart transplantation.
