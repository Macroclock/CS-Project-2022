Transvenous Endomyocardial Biopsy: A Comparison of 2 Approaches. Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is a well-established procedure for the diagnosis of specific myocardial diseases and represents the gold standard in monitoring allografts after heart transplantation. In our study, we compared 2 different approaches for harvesting EMB in order to optimize patient safety and efficacy of the procedure. As a standard approach for harvesting EMB, a venous introducer sheath was inserted percutaneously via the internal jugular vein using the Seldinger technique. Thereafter, a bioptome was repeatedly introduced throughout this sheath into the right ventricle (RV), each time passing the tricuspid valve (TV). Alternatively, a coronary sinus catheter was inserted via an introducer sheath placed in the subclavian vein and only once was introduced into RV cavity. Hence, just a unique passage of TV was required. Thereafter, a bioptome was introduced via this catheter and precisely guided to the targeted biopsy site. A standard approach was used with 34 patients, and a modified technique was used with 37 patients. Patient characteristics were comparable in both cohorts, and analyses of peri-procedural parameters identified only marginal differences between the groups. Interestingly, the number of harvested tissue samples per procedure was higher in the modified approach compared to the standard approach. No complications occurred. The modified approach for EMB is a safe procedure. The facilitated bioptome-guidance and enhanced protection of TV may prevent periprocedural complications.
