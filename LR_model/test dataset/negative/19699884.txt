Short- and long-term survival of patients transferred to a tertiary care center on temporary extracorporeal circulatory support. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) with temporary, extracorporeal assist devices restores hemodynamics in patients with refractory cardiogenic shock. These devices are frequently used in community hospitals, with subsequent referral to tertiary care centers. We sought to determine the outcomes of such referrals and identify prognostic variables that may influence management decisions. We performed a single-institution retrospective review of 59 consecutive patients transferred on temporary, extracorporeal MCS from 1997 to 2008. Demographics, medical history, laboratory data, and clinical status were obtained, with survival determined from the medical record and the Social Security Death Index. Univariable and multivariable analysis were performed and survival estimates were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. Median age was 49.6 years (range, 14 to 77 years). Forty-five patients (76%) were supported for postcardiotomy failure, and 34 (58%) required biventricular support. Twenty-five (42%) survived to hospital discharge, 11 after cardiac recovery (44%), 9 with long-term implantable MCS devices (39%), and 5 after heart transplantation (22%). Eight patients discharged with implantable MCS devices underwent heart transplantation and 1 remains alive on long-term implantable MCS support. Survival was 42% +/- 6% at 1 year and 38% +/- 6% at 5 years. Age and renal function were independent predictors of death. Nearly half of all patients transferred on temporary extracorporeal MCS survive to discharge. Most of the long-term survivors received a heart transplant. Age and renal function were independent predictors of death, suggesting that survival is maximized by considering eligibility for cardiac transplantation.
