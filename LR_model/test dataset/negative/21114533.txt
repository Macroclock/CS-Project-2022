Dynamic changes in Th1, Th17, and FoxP3+ T cells in patients with acute cellular rejection after cardiac transplantation. Previously, studies suggest that CD4(+) effector T-cell subsets participate in allograft rejection. However, the dynamic changes and relative roles of these CD4(+) effector T-cell subsets, especially Th17 cells, have not been systemically examined in patients with acute rejection after cardiac transplantation. In this study, we have studied and compared these CD4(+) T-cell subsets in peripheral blood and endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) in patients with stable-graft and acute cellular rejection. We observed that the gene expressions including T-bet, IFN-γ, RORγt, IL-17, IL-23, and FoxP3, the functional marker of Th1, Th17, and FoxP3(+) CD4(+) T cells, were elevated in EMB samples from patients with acute graft rejection. Accordingly, the percentages of circulating Th1, Th17, and FoxP3(+) CD4(+) T cells were also significantly increased. The data suggest that Th1, Th17, and FoxP3(+) CD4(+) T cells are associated with acute graft rejection in patients with cardiac transplantation.
