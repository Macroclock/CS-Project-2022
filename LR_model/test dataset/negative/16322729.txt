Computational design and experimental performance testing of an axial-flow pediatric ventricular assist device. The Virginia Artificial Heart Institute continues to design and develop an axial-flow pediatric ventricular assist device (PVAD) for infants and children in the United States. Our research team has created a database to track potential PVAD candidates at the University of Virginia Children's Hospital. The findings of this database aided with need assessment and design optimization of the PVAD. A numerical analysis of the optimized PVAD1 design (PVAD2 model) was also completed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to predict pressure-flow performance, fluid force estimations, and blood damage levels in the flow domain. Based on the PVAD2 model and after alterations to accommodate manufacturing, a plastic prototype for experimental flow testing was constructed via rapid prototyping techniques or stereolithography. CFD predictions demonstrated a pressure rise range of 36-118 mm Hg and axial fluid forces of 0.8-1.7 N for flows of 0.5-3 l/min over 7000-9000 rpm. Blood damage indices per CFD ranged from 0.24% to 0.35% for 200 massless and inert particles analyzed. Approximately 187 (93.5%) of the particles took less than 0.14 seconds to travel completely through the PVAD. The mean residence time was 0.105 seconds with a maximum time of 0.224 seconds. Additionally, in a water/glycerin blood analog solution, the plastic prototype produced pressure rises of 20-160 mm Hg for rotational speeds of 5960 +/- 18 rpm to 9975 +/- 31 rpm over flows from 0.5 to 4.5 l/min. The numerical results for the PVAD2 and the prototype hydraulic testing indicate an acceptable design for the pump, represent a significant step in the development phase of this device, and encourage manufacturing of a magnetically levitated prototype for animal experiments.
