A bridge to transplantation: The life experiences of patients with a left ventricular assist device. The Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) is a rapidly spreading treatment given to patients with advanced heart failure due to organ donor shortage. Thus, there is a need to study the life experience of patients who underwent LVAD implantation as a bridge to transplantation. To examine the life experiences of patients who underwent LVAD implantation as a bridge to transplantation. This qualitative, phenomenological research was carried out with 13 patients who underwent LVAD implantation as a bridge to transplantation. Data were collected through semi-structured in-depth interviews. Interviews were recorded through an audio recorder, transcribed verbatim, and evaluated using the inductive content analysis method. Two main themes (fear and coping), each with four sub-themes, were obtained after data were analyzed. Participants' fears and coping strategies for these were identified. In this study, fears and coping strategies came to the forefront in the life experiences of patients who underwent LVAD implantation as a bridge to transplantation.
