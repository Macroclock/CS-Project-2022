Long-term biventricular support following myocardial infarction from anterior descending coronary artery damage due to stabbing: A case report. The use of dual continuous-flow assist devices for biventricular support remains novel with only small case series or reports documenting outcomes. We describe a 21-year-old woman suffered stabbing with damage of coronary artery with subsequent myocardial infarction and severe postinfarction heart failure with impaired right ventricular function. The patient underwent implantation of two continuous-flow ventricular assist devices. The early postoperative period was followed by severe respiratory insufficiency and an asthenic syndrome, which required prolonged intensive care and mechanical ventilation. After prolonged hospital stay, she was discharged home waiting for heart transplantation. With the continuing miniaturization of pump designs, less invasive, more durable and cost-effective pumps have become available for dual assist device therapy in in these critically ill heart failure patients.
