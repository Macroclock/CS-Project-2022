Coronary Pan-Ischemia as a First Sign of a Fulminant Host-Versus-Graft Reaction Eight Years After Orthotopic Heart Transplantation. Acute graft rejection in patients after heart transplantation can cause arrhythmias and acute angina pectoris with electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation. We report a case of a 53-year old female patient who had undergone cardiac transplantation 8 years previously. She developed bradycardia with co-existent ST-segment elevation caused by a histologically proven acute graft rejection. After administration of methylprednisolone and immune absorption leading to initial clinical improvement, the patient died unexpectedly. The reasons remain unclear, but a degeneration of the conduction system as well as impaired blood flow in the right coronary caused by cellular and humoral rejection most likely have both contributed.
