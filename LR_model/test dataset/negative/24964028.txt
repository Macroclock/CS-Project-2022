Iron metabolism in transplantation. Recipient's iron status is an important determinant of clinical outcome in transplantation medicine. This review addresses iron metabolism in solid organ transplantation, where the role of iron as a mediator of ischemia-reperfusion injury, as an immune-modulatory element, and as a determinant of organ and graft function is discussed. Although iron chelators reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury in cell and animal models, these benefits have not yet been implemented into clinical practice. Iron deficiency and iron overload are associated with reduced immune activation, whose molecular mechanisms are reviewed in detail. Furthermore, iron overload and hyperferritinemia are associated with poor prognosis in end-stage organ failure in patients awaiting kidney, or liver transplantation. This negative prognostic impact of iron overload appears to persist after transplantation, which highlights the need for optimizing iron management before and after solid organ transplantation. In contrast, iron deficiency and anemia are also associated with poor prognosis in patients with end-stage heart failure. Intravenous iron supplementation should be managed carefully because parenterally induced iron overload could persist after successful transplantation. In conclusion, current evidence shows that iron overload and iron deficiency are important risk factors before and after solid organ transplantation. Iron status should therefore be actively managed in patients on the waiting list and after transplantation.
