Advanced heart failure due to cancer therapy. Certain chemotherapeutic agents and mediastinal irradiation can be cardiotoxic and place cancer survivors at risk for developing advanced heart failure (HF). Anthracyclines are the prototypical agents associated with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Newer agents including trastuzumab and certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sunitinib can also cause cardiomyopathy. Cancer survivors with advanced HF refractory to standard medical management should be considered for advanced therapies, including mechanical circulatory support (MCS) and transplantation. While overall outcomes after MCS and transplantation are similar in cancer survivors compared to other etiologies of HF, patients with radiation-induced restrictive cardiomyopathy have a significantly worse prognosis after transplantation. The increased need for right ventricular (RV) support after MCS in cancer survivors necessitates a careful evaluation for pre-operative RV dysfunction. Special consideration must also be given to the risk for recurrent malignancy, neurocognitive dysfunction, and increased psychological needs in this patient population.
