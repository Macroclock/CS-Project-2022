Cardiomyocyte injury to transplant: pediatric management. Cardiomyocyte injury in pediatric patients has a vast number of causes, which are often distinct from the causes of adult heart failure. However, the management of pediatric heart failure and heart transplantation has generally been inferred from adult studies. New therapies show great promise for the neurohormonal regulation of heart failure and the ability to control immunosuppression after heart transplantation. Large, randomized, multicenter, controlled clinical trials are needed to determine the efficacy of these therapies in this population. This article reviews the current recommendations and evidence-based medicine, where available, for the medical management of myopathic dysfunction and transplantation in pediatric patients.
