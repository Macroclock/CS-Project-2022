Refractory Ventricular Tachycardia in a Patient With a Left Ventricular Assist Device Successfully Treated With Stellate Ganglion Phototherapy. Neuraxial modulation therapies, such as stellate ganglion block, thoracic epidural anaesthesia, and cardiac sympathetic denervation, are effective for ventricular arrhythmias. However, these treatments can increase the risk of bleeding and infection. In this case report, stellate ganglion phototherapy was safely and effectively performed for refractory ventricular tachycardias in a patient with a history of left ventricular assist device implantation. Stellate ganglion phototherapy may have the potential to treat refractory ventricular arrhythmias as an additive therapy or bridge therapy.
