Hybrid treatment of inferior vena cava obstruction after orthotopic heart transplantation. Caval stenosis with subsequent thrombosis may occur after orthotopic heart transplantation (HT). Management of this complication may include a percutaneous approach or an open surgical one. Here, we report the case of an obstruction and severe thrombosis of the inferior vena cava, following orthotopic HT, that was managed in a hybrid fashion with surgical venous thrombectomy, inferior vena cava stenting, and atrio-caval patch-plasty.
