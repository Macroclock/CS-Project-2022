Repair of congenital heart disease: a primer--Part 2. This review, the second of two parts, describes the repair of aortic arch anomalies, left-to-right shunts, valvular disease, tetralogy of Fallot, and truncus arteriosus. Cardiac transplantation is also discussed. Advances in the surgical management of congenital heart disease have led to improved patient survival and quality of life. Improvements in technology in computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have resulted in increasing utilization of cross-sectional imaging in these patients. Perioperative care necessitates that radiologists have a basic understanding of the surgical treatment and the resultant postoperative anatomy. Because many patients with treated congenital heart disease are being followed up into the 4th and 5th decades of life, this is information that will fall within the domain of all radiologists who interpret cross-sectional images of the thorax.
