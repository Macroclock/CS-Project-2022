Vitamin D3 combined with antibody agents suppresses alloreactive memory T-cell responses to induce heart allograft long-term survival. The pre-stored memory T cells in organ transplant patient carry a high risk of allograft rejection. The current study aimed to determine whether the allogenic response of adoptively transferred memory T cells in mice was suppressed by vitamin D3 monotherapy alone or in combination with monoclonal antibody treatment. Prior to vascularized heterotopic heart transplantation, naïve C57BL/6 mice were primed with memory T cells. Recipient mice were administered vitamin D3 alone or in combination with monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD40L/ anti-LFA-1). Memory T cells and CD4 Vitamin D3 in conjunction with anti-CD40L/ anti-LFA-1 antibodies were administered according to the median survival time from 6.5 to 80 days. The results revealed that grafts were protected through the prevention of inflammatory cell infiltration. Combined treatment decreased the mRNA levels of IL-2, IFN-γ and IL-10 and increased the mRNA levels of IL-4, Foxp3 and TGF-β in the allograft. Rejection was suppressed by a reduction of CD4 Vitamin D3 efficiently protected allografts from memory T-cell allo-responses when combined with anti-CD40L/anti-LFA-1 antibodies therapy.
