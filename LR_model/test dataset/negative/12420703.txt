Mycotic cerebral vasculitis in a paediatric cardiac transplant patient excludes misadventure. We present the case of a 10-year-old girl with cardiomyopathy who received a heart transplant. Due to organ rejection, the dosage of immunosuppressive agents was increased postoperatively. The patient complained of intermittent headaches in the following days and developed a haemorrhagic necrosis of the left thalamus. A week later, an oral dose of cyclosporin A was accidentally given intravenously, and 2 weeks later a recurrent subarachnoid haemorrhage of unknown origin was diagnosed. The clinical course was then characterised by progressive deterioration resulting in coma, fluctuating brain stem symptoms and the development of a massive cerebral oedema with subsequent brain death. A coroner's autopsy was instigated to investigate a claim of medical misadventure. Neuropathological investigations found a focal infiltration of fungal hyphae in the left posterior cerebral artery resulting in necrosis of the vascular wall and thus explaining the source of the recurrent subarachnoid haemorrhage which eventually resulted in the girl's death. Medical misadventure due to the administration of cyclosporin was not directly responsible for the death of this patient. This case illustrates that it is of paramount importance to copiously sample and investigate the basal cerebral arteries in cases of subarachnoid haemorrhage of unknown origin, in particular in a medico-legal context.
