[Prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus infection in heart transplantation]. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common complication after heart transplantation, affecting almost half of all recipients. The clinical spectrum of this infection includes, in order of greater to lesser severity, latent infection, asymptomatic viremia, CMV syndrome and CMV disease. CMV is associated with rejection and vascular graft disease and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The factors most frequently involved in susceptibility to this infection and its severity are donor and recipient CMV serological status, the intensity of immunosuppression and the type of immunosuppressive agents used. The management strategies of this infection include universal or targeted prophylaxis, preemptive therapy and treatment of established disease. The use of preventive measures significantly reduces the incidence of symtomatic infection or CMV disease, which has been reported to be less than 3% in some recent series.
