Studies of LDL particle size and susceptibility to oxidation and association with glucose metabolism in children after heart transplantation. Increased concentrations of serum triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol are common after heart transplantation (HTx). These abnormalities may promote transplant vascular disease and atherosclerosis, especially if LDL is small, dense, and oxidized. There have been no previous studies of LDL particle size and LDL susceptibility to oxidation in children after HTx. Twenty-three HTx recipients (aged 3-19 years) who received triple-drug immunosuppression therapy after HTx and 181 controls within the same age range participated in the study. Total, high-density lipoprotein, and LDL-cholesterol concentrations; triglyceride concentration, and glucose and insulin concentrations during oral glucose tolerance tests were determined an average of 3 years after HTx (range, 1-7 years). Moreover, we determined serum lipoprotein (a) concentration, apolipoprotein E phenotype, LDL particle size, and indices of LDL susceptibility to copper-induced oxidation in 12 HTx recipients. We found hypertriglyceridemia in 56.5% and hyperinsulinemia in 30.4% of patients. Triglyceride concentration and body mass index were associated significantly with insulin concentration (p < 0.008 for both). Low-density lipoprotein particle size, LDL susceptibility to in vitro oxidation, and lipoprotein (a) concentrations did not differ significantly between HTx patients and controls. Low-density lipoprotein particle size was associated inversely with cyclosporine through level (Neoral, r = -0.59, p = 0.045), whereas weight-adjusted dosage of cyclosporine correlated positively with longer lag time of LDL oxidation (r = 0.69, p = 0.013). Hypertriglyceridemia and hyperinsulinemia were common in children receiving triple-drug immunosuppression therapy after HTx. Increased cyclosporine through concentration was associated with small LDL particle size but did not increase LDL susceptibility to oxidation.
