Early Outcomes After Heart Transplantation in Recipients Bridged With a HeartMate 3 Device. Left ventricular assist devices are increasingly used as bridge-to-transplantation in eligible patients. The HeartMate 3 (HM3; Abbott Laboratories, Abbot Park, IL) is the latest device to obtain US Food and Drug Administration approval as bridge-to-transplantation. This study examines early outcomes of transplant recipients after HM3 in comparison with recipients bridged with the HeartMate 2 (HM2; Abbott Laboratories) and HeartWare Ventricular Assist System (HVAD; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) devices. Using the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database, we identified all adult patients who were slated for bridge-to-transplantation with a continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (HM2, HVAD, or HM3) between April 1, 2015 and January 31, 2018. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality 6 months after transplantation. The independent influence of the bridging device on outcomes was determined using Cox proportional hazard models. Patients (N = 1,978) were successfully bridged to transplantation with the HM2 (n = 881), HVAD (n = 920), or HM3 (n = 177) device. Six-month mortality rates were similar across these devices (HM2, 5.9%; HVAD, 7.7%; HM3, 4.7%; log-rank p = 0.30). On average HM2 patients were on a left ventricular assist device for 2 months longer (p < 0.01). The HVAD had the lowest rate of device exchange before transplant (p = 0.01). The HM3 had no events of pump thrombosis (p < 0.01). HVAD patients had the lowest rate of device malfunction before to transplant (p < 0.01). Panel reactive antibodies at the time of transplantation were lower for HM3 patients (p < 0.01); however rates of graft rejection at 6 months were not different (p = 0.25). The HM3 device provides excellent early outcomes as a bridge to transplantation and may be associated with a reduction in comorbidities. Longer follow-up is needed to better define differences between durable left ventricular assist devices.
