Transplantation for Congenital Heart Disease: Focus on the Impact of Functionally Univentricular Versus Biventricular Circulation. Varying single center data exist regarding the posttransplant outcomes of patients with single ventricle circulation, particularly following the Fontan operation. We sought to better elucidate these results in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) through combining two national databases. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) transplantation database was merged with the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS), an administrative database with 71% of UNOS patients matched. Patients undergoing transplantation at a PHIS hospital from 2006 to 2017 were categorized as single ventricle or biventricular strategy based on their diagnoses and procedures in 90% of patients. When known, single ventricle patients were further analyzed by their palliative stage post-Glenn or post-Fontan (known in 31%). A total of 1,517 CHD transplantations were identified, 67% with single ventricle strategy (1,016). Single ventricle, biventricular, and indeterminate patients had similar survival (log-rank  Single ventricle patients, as a group, experience similar outcomes as biventricular patients with CHD undergoing transplantation, and this extends to Fontan patients. Risk factors for mortality correlate with end-organ dysfunction as well as race and ABO blood type incompatibility in the CHD population.
