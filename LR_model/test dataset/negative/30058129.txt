Initial experience with bosentan for the management of pulmonary hypertension after heart transplantation. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) after heart transplantation (HT) is associated to right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and increased morbidity and mortality. We present our experience with bosentan for the treatment of PH after HT. A retrospective evaluation of patients with PH receiving bosentan post-transplant was performed. Pulmonary hemodynamics before and after bosentan (BG) and clinical outcomes were assessed and compared to a historical control group (CG) not receiving bosentan. Between 2013 and 2016, 21 patients were treated post-transplant with bosentan. Twenty-four hours after bosentan initiation, there were significant decreases in systolic (42.5 ± 8 to 38.1 ± 8 mm Hg, P = 0.015), diastolic (21.4 ± 4 to 17.8 ± 6 mm Hg, P = 0.008) and mean (29.6 ± 5 to 25 ± 6 mm Hg, P = 0.001) pulmonary artery pressures (PAP), transpulmonary gradient (13.1 ± 3 to 9.7 ± 4 mm Hg, P < 0.001), diastolic gradient (5.2 ± 4 to 2.3 ± 3 mm Hg, P = 0.001) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (2.2 ± 1 to 1.6 ± 1WU, P = 0.015). This effect was maintained at day 3. Compared with CG, BG showed significantly more decrease in PVR (0.7 ± 0.9 vs 0.3 ± 1.7WU, P = 0.025) and mean PAP (4.6 ± 5.2 vs 1.5 ± 4.4 mm Hg, P = 0.040). RV function 7 days post-transplant was significantly better in BG compared to CG, P = 0.004. There were not clinically significant interactions between bosentan and immunosuppressive treatment. Bosentan, initiated early post-transplant, was associated with a significant decrease in PVR. Bosentan was well tolerated and did not interact with immunosuppressive treatment.
