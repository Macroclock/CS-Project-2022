Cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) for the monitoring of the atherosclerosis after heart transplantation. Atherosclerosis has been reported to progress rapidly after heart transplantation. A quantitative diagnosis is required for the diagnosis of atherosclerosis after heart transplantation. In this study, we compared brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) for the diagnosis. The average values of both baPWV and CAVI in the seven cases after heart transplantation were found to be signif-icantly large in comparison to the average values of the normal healthy people of the same age group. When comparisons were made before and after the heart transplantation in a particular case, CAVI was stable and baPWV changed sharply. A lot of parameters such as blood pressure, blood volume, etc. have been reported to influence baPWV. The results of this study suggested that CAVI was a stable parameter in comparison to baPWV even after heart transplantation. Thus, CAVI may be useful in the diagnosis of arteriosclerosis after heart transplantation.
