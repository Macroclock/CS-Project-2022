Comparing parents' and children's views of children's quality of life after heart transplant. The purpose of this focused ethnographic study was to explore the quality of life (QOL) of school-age heart-transplant recipients. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 11 parent-child dyads. Data were analyzed using content analysis and constant comparison. Participants identified key factors impacting the children's QOL including: participation in normal activities, normalcy, staying healthy, sources of strength and support, and struggles (parents' perspectives) and doing what kids do, being with family and friends, and being a heart transplant kid (children's perspectives). Interventions focusing on the key factors identified by participants may impact the QOL of school-age heart-transplant recipients.
