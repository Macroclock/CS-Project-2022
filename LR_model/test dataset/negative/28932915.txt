Outcomes in patients with advanced heart failure and small body size undergoing continuous-flow left ventricular assist device implantation. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have become a preferred treatment option for patients with end-stage heart failure when used as a bridge to transplant or as a destination therapy. However, the association between small body size and postoperative outcomes for continuous-flow (CF) LVAD recipients is still being studied. We sought to determine whether body surface area (BSA) is associated with patient outcomes after CF-LVAD implantation. The study cohort of our single-center, retrospective review consisted of all patients (n = 526) who underwent CF-LVAD implantation (n = 403 HeartMate II, n = 123 HeartWare) between November 2003 and March 2016 regardless of indication. Patients were stratified into 2 cohorts according to their BSA measurements: small BSA (<1.5 m 'Body mass index (BMI)', 'Body surface area (BSA)', 'Heart failure', 'Left ventricular assist device (LVAD)', 'Obesity'
