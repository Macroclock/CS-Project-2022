Unusual pacemaker implantation through a left sided superior vena cava via anonymous vein after heart transplantion. We report the case of a 56-year-old male heart transplant recipient, who underwent postoperative pacemaker implantation through a left sided superior vena cava (LSVC) via anonymous vein. We describe our successful management of this case. We suggest that the specific anatomic conditions should be considered in all heart transplant recipients with LSVC if pacemaker implantation is necessary postoperatively.
