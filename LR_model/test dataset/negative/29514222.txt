Short-term mechanical circulatory support for severe primary graft dysfunction following orthotopic heart transplant. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is a devastating complication and the most common cause of early death following a heart transplant. The goal of this study was to report our experience of using mechanical circulatory support to manage severe PGD. Following 208 heart transplants performed between January 2007 and May 2017, 14 (6.7%) patients presented with severe PGD. We provided haemodynamic support using the following approaches: a venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation device, left ventricular assist device, right ventricular assist device and biventricular assist device. Primary complications included severe PGD, which resulted in hospital deaths and late survival. The mean follow-up was 3.7 ± 2.7 years. Fourteen (6.7%) heart transplant recipients presented with severe PGD. Seven patients received a venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation device; 1 patient received a left ventricular assist device; 4 patients received a right ventricular assist device; and 2 patients received a biventricular assist device. Mean device support and explantation times were 4.7 ± 2 and 6.3 ± 2 days, respectively. Weaning with cardiac recovery was successful in 57.1% of the patients. The hospital mortality rate was 50%. Postoperative causes of morbidity included renal failure that necessitated dialysis in 28.5%, surgical re-exploration due to postoperative bleeding in 57.1%, pneumonia in 28.5%, sepsis in 14.2%, sternal wound infection in 14.2% and mediastinitis in 7.1% of the patients, respectively. There were no deaths following hospital discharge or later follow-up appointments. Mechanical support devices such as venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation specifically offer a reliable therapeutic approach. Recognizing the relatively high number of deaths in-hospital, patients who have cardiac recovery and a successful hospital discharge can expect a favourable late outcome.
