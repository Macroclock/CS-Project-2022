Cryptococcal disease presenting as necrotizing cellulitis in transplant recipients. Disseminated cryptococcosis uncommonly presents with skin lesions in immunocompromised hosts. Necrotizing fasciitis, necrotizing vasculitis, myositis, or necrotizing soft tissue infection are even more rare presentations. We report 3 cases of cryptococcal necrotizing soft tissue infection, 2 in renal transplant patients, and 1 in a heart transplant patient, and discuss similar cases from the literature. Cryptococcus neoformans should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cellulitis or necrotizing soft tissue infections in immunocompromised patients.
