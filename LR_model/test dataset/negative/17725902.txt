[Organ donation from alcohol and opioid-abusing patient]. A case of a 37-year old obese patient with alcohol, sedative and opioid abuse as well as previous admissions with chest pain is presented. The patient suffered from a large subarachnoid haemorrhage and the clinical diagnosis of brain death was made. He had substantial signs of organ failure. The patient was registered as a potential organ donor in the Danish Registry for Organ Donation, and his heart and kidneys were donated. Considering all brain dead patients as potential organ donors is important.
