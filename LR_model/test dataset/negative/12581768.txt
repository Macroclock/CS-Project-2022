Creatine kinase and troponin after myocardial preservation using HTK solution (Custoidol) for clinical heart transplantation. Myocardial preservation by Bretschneider histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution (Custoidol) was studied in transplanted patients. Post-operative creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB and troponin I were higher in patients with an ischemic time of >or=4 hours; however, values were within the acceptable range for clinical heart transplantation.
