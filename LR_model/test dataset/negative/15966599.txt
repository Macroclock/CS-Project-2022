[Extracorporeal assistance in paediatric intensive care]. For 3 years we have used extracorporeal assistance in intensive care frequently. This study evaluates our results. We studied the patient records for those treated between January 2002 and January 2005. The method used, indications and morbidity/mortality were analysed. We performed 24 circulatory assistance procedures in 20 patients (median age: 5 months), arterio-venous with oxygenation (n=18), veino-venous with oxygenation (n=3) or biventricular (n=3). The indications were post cardiotomy cardio-respiratory failure (Group I; n=20, 16 patients), pure respiratory failure (Group II: n=1), or pre-transplant/recovery (Group III: n=3). Five procedures (4 from group I and 1 from group III) required cardiac massage (no fatalities). The average duration of assistance was 7 +/- 6 days (2 to 20 days). Treatment was successfully discontinued in sixteen patients 80%), one of them thanks to heart transplant. Four (20%) died during assistance. The morbidity essentially consisted of further surgery for haemostasis, multiple transfusions, and infections. Three patients (15%) died later (1 at 17 months after discontinuation) from complications unrelated to the assistance. No neurological sequelae were noted in the survivors. These results confirm the usefulness of circulatory assistance when medical treatment has failed, particularly in the post-operative period of paediatric cardiac surgery or while awaiting transplantation.
