Expanding the donor pool: use of a donor heart having undergone recent cardiac surgery. The current shortage of donor organs is a well-recognized global phenomenon. The goal of contemporary transplant practice is to optimize and expand the organ donor pool. Despite biologic and technologic advancements, the single most important limitation remains underutilization and non-recovery of potential organs. We report the use of a donor cardiac organ from a 5-year-old child who had undergone recent (<72 hours) closure of an atrial septal defect. The heart was harvested successfully and implanted with no apparent hemodynamic compromise.
