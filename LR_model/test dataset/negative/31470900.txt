Berlin Heart EXCOR® pediatric ventricular assist device in a patient with Sotos syndrome: a case report. Berlin Heart EXCOR® pediatric ventricular assist device is a mechanical circulatory support device currently used in pediatric patients. Sotos syndrome is a well-described multiple anomaly syndrome characterized by overgrowth, distinctive craniofacial appearance, cardiac abnormalities, and variable learning disabilities. We describe a 7-year-old female Caucasian child with classic Sotos syndrome features subjected to implantation of Berlin Heart EXCOR® pediatric biventricular assist device mechanical support. A heart transplant was carried out after a support time of 459 days. After 5 years of follow-up, our patient is clinically stable and the performance of the transplanted heart is excellent. This case confirms that Berlin Heart EXCOR® pediatric ventricular assist device can provide satisfactory and safe circulatory support for children with end-stage heart diseases, even in those with Sotos syndrome. The syndrome is not a contraindication to implantation, since the complications are the same as those observed in patients without the syndrome and the prognosis is not affected by the disease.
