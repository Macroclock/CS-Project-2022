Tricuspid annular and septal Doppler tissue velocities are reduced in pediatric heart transplant recipients without acute rejection. We sought to determine any differences between myocardial velocities in healthy children and pediatric heart transplant recipients without acute allograft rejection and to study the clinical factors that could alter these velocities. Fifty-eight pediatric heart transplant recipients without rejection and 27 healthy controls were prospectively enrolled. Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) was performed at the tricuspid annulus, septum, and mitral annulus. The influence of the following factors on DTI was assessed: time since transplant, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, systemic hypertension, graft atherosclerosis, pulmonary hypertension, donor heart ischemic time, and previous rejection. The mean tricuspid annular and septal tissue velocities were significantly reduced in the transplant group compared with controls. The mitral annular velocities were similar in the two groups. Donor heart ischemic time and previous rejection significantly altered DTI velocities. Tricuspid annular and septal Doppler tissue velocities are significantly reduced in pediatric heart transplant recipients without allograft rejection and can be altered by prolonged donor heart ischemic time and previous rejection.
