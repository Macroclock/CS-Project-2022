[Prenatal diagnosis of fetal aortic stenosis with mitral insufficiency. Review of the ultrasound diagnosis and perinatal prognosis: a case report]. This is a report about a case of prenatal diagnosis of critical fetal aortic stenosis with severe mitral valve insufficiency in a 35+6 weeks fetus. Aortic stenosis represents 3% of congenital heart diseases, but its association with mitral regurgitation is quite unusual. Thanks to the latest advances in fetal ultrasonography we can now achieve a more precise diagnosis and we have been able to improve the understanding of its physiopathology. Based on this case we have reviewed the most recent literature about fetal aortic stenosis and mitral valve insufficiency, with the aim of summarizing its main physiopathological features, highlighting the clues and key points for its intrauterine diagnosis, describing its principal complications and summarizing its current treatment options.
