Pathways to acute humoral rejection. Acute humoral rejection, also known as acute vascular rejection, is a devastating condition of organ transplants and a major barrier to clinical application of organ xenotransplantation. Although initiation of acute humoral or vascular rejection is generally linked to the action of antibodies and complement on the graft, other factors such as ischemia, platelets, T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages have also been implicated. Central to any understanding of the pathogenesis of acute humoral rejection, and to developing means of preventing it, is to know whether these factors injure the graft independently or through one or few pathways. We addressed this question by examining early events in a severe model of vascular rejection in which guinea pig hearts transplanted heterotopically into rats treated with cobra venom factor (CVF) develop disease over 72 hours. The early steps in acute vascular rejection were associated with expression of a set of inflammatory genes, which appeared to be controlled by availability of interleukin (IL)-1. Interruption of IL-1 signaling by IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) averted expression of these genes and early tissue changes, including coagulation and influx of inflammatory cells. These findings suggest IL-1 plays an important role in initiation of acute humoral rejection.
