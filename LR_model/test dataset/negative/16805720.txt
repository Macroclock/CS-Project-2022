Everolimus: an immunosuppressive agent in transplantation. Everolimus is a novel immunosuppressive agent related to sirolimus. It is a proliferation signal inhibitor with an improved pharmacokinetic profile and bioavailability compared with sirolimus. Everolimus has been shown to be as effective as mycophenolate mofetil in reducing acute rejection in renal transplantation. In cardiac transplant recipients, it is superior to azathioprine in reducing acute rejection and cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Its use is also associated with a decrease in cytomegalovirus infection. However, coadministration with calcineurin inhibitors requires careful dose adjustment to prevent renal toxicity. Antiproliferative effects of everolimus may abrogate the increased risk of malignancy seen in solid organ transplantation.
