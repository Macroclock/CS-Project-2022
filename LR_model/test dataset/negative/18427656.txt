Intraoperative anticoagulation management during cardiac transplantation for a patient with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and a left ventricular assist device. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is an immunologically mediated syndrome that is associated with potentially life-threatening arterial and venous thrombosis. Re-exposing patients who have heparin-induced thrombocytopenia to heparin during cardiopulmonary bypass may be hazardous. We describe the re-exposure to unfractionated heparin of a patient with a left ventricular assist device and evidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia who needed cardiac transplantation, which was accomplished without complications.
