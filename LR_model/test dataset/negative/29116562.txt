Prediction of long-term (> 10 year) cardiovascular outcomes in heart transplant recipients: Value of stress technetium-99m tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion imaging. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is useful in the evaluation of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) in heart transplant (HTx) recipients. The current study evaluated the long-term prognostic value of stress SPECT MPI for predicting all-cause mortality and cardiac events in HTx recipients. The study population consisted of 166 HTx recipients (mean age 54 ± 10 years, 84% male) who underwent exercise or dobutamine stress  MPI abnormalities were detected in 55 patients (33%), including fixed defects in 28 patients (17%), partially reversible in 17 patients (10%), and completely reversible defects in 10 patients (6%). During a median follow-up of 12.8 years (range 0-15, mean follow-up 9.5 years), 109 (66%) patients died (all-cause mortality), of which 67 (40%) were due to cardiac causes. A total of 5 (3%) patients experienced a non-fatal MI.
