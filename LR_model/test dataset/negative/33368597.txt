Development of a human heart-sized perfusion system for metabolic imaging studies using hyperpolarized [1- Increasing worldwide demand for cardiac transplantation has spurred new developments to increase the donor pool. Normothermic preservation of heart grafts for transplantation is an emerging strategy to improve the utilization of marginal grafts. Hyperpolarized MR using metabolic tracers such as [1- Hearts from three 40-kg Danish domestic pigs were harvested and subsequently perfused in Langendorff mode under normothermic conditions, using an MR-compatible perfusion system adapted to the heart. Proton MRI and hyperpolarized [1- Hearts were perfused with whole blood for 120 min, using a dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion experiment to verify successful myocardial perfusion. Hyperpolarized [1- We investigated the metabolic and functional status of machine-perfused porcine hearts. Utilizing hyperpolarized methodology to acquire detailed myocardial metabolic information-in combination with already established MR methods for cardiac investigation-provides a powerful tool to aid the progress of donor heart preservation.
