REVeAL-HF: Design and Rationale of a Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial Embedded Within Routine Clinical Practice. Heart failure (HF) is one of the most common causes of hospitalization in the United States and carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Use of evidence-based interventions may improve outcomes, but their use is encumbered in part by limitations in accurate prognostication. The REVeAL-HF (Risk EValuation And its Impact on ClinicAL Decision Making and Outcomes in Heart Failure) trial is the first to definitively evaluate the impact of knowledge about prognosis on clinical decision making and patient outcomes. The REVeAL-HF trial is a pragmatic, completely electronic, randomized controlled trial that has completed enrollment of 3,124 adults hospitalized for HF, defined as having an N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level of >500 pg/ml and receiving intravenous diuretic agents within 24 h of admission. Patients randomized to the intervention had their risk of 1-year mortality generated with information in the electronic health record and presented to their providers, who had the option to give feedback on their impression of this risk assessment. The authors are examining the impact of this information on clinical decision-making (use of HF pharmacotherapies, referral to electrophysiology, palliative care referral, and referral for advanced therapies like heart transplantation or mechanical circulatory support) and patient outcomes (length of stay, post-discharge 30-day rehospitalizations, and 1-year mortality). The REVeAL-HF trial will definitively examine whether knowledge about prognosis in HF has an impact on clinical decision making and patient outcomes. It will also examine the relationship between calculated, perceived, and real risk of mortality in this patient population.
