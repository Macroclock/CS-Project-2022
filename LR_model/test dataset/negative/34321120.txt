Coronary artery fistulas after paediatric heart transplantation. Coronary artery fistulas have been described in patients after heart transplantation more often than in the normal population. We reviewed our centre's database between 2008 and 2020. Thirty patients had coronary angiography and 13 showed non-cameral coronary artery fistulas in their first coronary angiography. Distribution, degree and evolution of the fistulas and characteristics of transplant procedure, patient and immunosuppressive treatments were analysed.
