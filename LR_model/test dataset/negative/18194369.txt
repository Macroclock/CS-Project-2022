Simultaneous mold infections in an orthotopic heart transplant recipient. Simultaneous mold infections in heart transplant recipients have not been previously reported. Here we describe early onset post-transplant pulmonary aspergillosis and cutaneous zygomycosis in a 46-year-old heart transplant recipient who was also treated with basiliximab. Along with surgical debridement, medical treatment of his cutaneous abdominal wall zygomycosis at the former left ventricular assist device driveline site with liposomal amphotericin B and voriconazole also led to cure of his pulmonary aspergillosis.
