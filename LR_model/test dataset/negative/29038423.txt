Regulation of T cell alloimmunity by PI3Kγ and PI3Kδ. Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K) γ and δ are preferentially enriched in leukocytes, and defects in these signaling pathways have been shown to impair T cell activation. The effects of PI3Kγ and PI3Kδ on alloimmunity remain underexplored. Here, we show that both PI3Kγ
