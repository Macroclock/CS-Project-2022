Mechanical stretch regimen enhances the formation of bioengineered autologous cardiac muscle grafts. Surgical repair of congenital and acquired cardiac defects may be enhanced by the use of autologous bioengineered muscle grafts. These tissue-engineered constructs are not optimal in their formation and function. We hypothesized that a mechanical stretch regimen applied to human heart cells that were seeded on a three-dimensional gelatin scaffold (Gelfoam) would improve tissue formation and enhance graft strength. Heart cells from children undergoing repair of Tetralogy of Fallot were isolated and cultured. Heart cells were seeded on gelatin-matrix scaffolds (Gelfoam) and subjected to cyclical mechanical stress (n=7) using the Bio-Stretch Apparatus (80 cycles/minute for 14 days). Control scaffolds (n=7) were maintained under identical conditions but without cyclical stretch. Cell counting, histology, and computerized image analysis determined cell proliferation and their spatial distribution within the tissue-engineered grafts. Collagen matrix formation and organization was determined with polarized light and laser confocal microscopy. Uniaxial tensile testing assessed tissue-engineered graft function. Human heart cells proliferated within the gelatin scaffold. Remarkably, grafts that were subjected to cyclical stretch demonstrated increased cell proliferation and a marked improvement of cell distribution. Collagen matrix formation and organization was enhanced by mechanical stretch. Both maximal tensile strength and resistance to stretch were improved by cyclical mechanical stretch. The cyclical mechanical stretch regimen enhanced the formation of a three-dimensional tissue-engineered cardiac graft by improving the proliferation and distribution of seeded human heart cells and by stimulating organized matrix formation resulting in an order of magnitude increase in the mechanical strength of the graft.
