Further analysis of the T-cell subsets and pathways of murine cardiac allograft rejection. The present study examined the role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in cardiac allograft rejection when either the direct or indirect pathway was eliminated for the CD4+ portion of the response. To study the pathways in vivo, we used genetically altered mouse strains that lack class II antigens as either the donors or recipients for cardiac transplantation. In contrast to earlier published studies, which used different strain combinations, we found that either CD4- or CD8-depletion prolonged cardiac allograft survival moderately, but not indefinitely, in an MHC-mismatched, minor-matched combination. When the CD4+ indirect pathway was eliminated, rapid graft rejection occurred when both T-cell subsets were present and when either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were depleted. When the CD4+ direct pathway was eliminated, rapid graft rejection occurred when both T-cell subsets were present, there was slow rejection when CD4+ T cells were eliminated, and no rejection was seen for more than 100 days when CD8+ T cells were eliminated. However, the long-surviving allografts on the recipients with only CD4+ cells and an indirect pathway did show evidence of chronic vasculopathy. Thus, either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells can mediate acute cardiac allograft rejection in these experiments when both pathways are available. In addition, CD4+ T cells can provide help for acute rejection through either the direct or indirect pathway. Finally, recipients who have only CD4+ cells and an indirect pathway do not demonstrate acute rejection, but do show evidence of chronic rejection.
