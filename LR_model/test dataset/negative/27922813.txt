Transcatheter Tricuspid Repair With MitraClip for Severe Primary Tricuspid Regurgitation. Severe tricuspid regurgitation is an independent predictor of adverse outcomes, yet few patients undergo surgery and treatment with medical therapy is often inadequate. Recent studies have reported the use of the MitraClip system (Abbott Vascular) to treat secondary tricuspid regurgitation. We describe the first use of MitraClip to treat severe primary tricuspid regurgitation and right heart failure in a patient with previous cardiac transplantation and high surgical risk.
