Non-heart-beating donors in thoracic transplantation. Access to lung transplantation is severely limited by a scarcity of suitable donors, resulting in increasing numbers of deaths on the heart and lung transplant waiting lists, and strict selection criteria for recipients. Unlike some other solid organs, the lung may be ideally suited to retrieval for transplant following substantial intervals after circulatory arrest. This may be because lung parenchymal cells do not rely on perfusion for cellular respiration. This review outlines the relevant published experimental data that addresses the concept that lungs might be suitable for transplant even if retrieved from non-heart-beating donors (NHBDs), and the small published clinical experience with NHBDs as lung donors. Aspects of reperfusion injury in this setting are reviewed. The prospect of heart transplant from NHBDs is addressed. The impact of the routine use of NHBDs on lung transplantation is discussed.
