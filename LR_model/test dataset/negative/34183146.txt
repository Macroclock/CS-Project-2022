Long-Term Impact of Body Mass Index on Survival of Patients Undergoing Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy: A Multi-Centre Study. Obesity is a risk factor for heart failure (HF), but its presence among HF patients may be associated with favorable outcomes. We investigated the long-term outcomes across different body mass index (BMI) groups, after cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), and whether defibrillator back-up (CRT-D) confers survival benefit. One thousand two-hundred seventy-seven (1,277) consecutive patients (mean age: 67.0 ± 12.7 years, 44.1% women, and mean BMI: 28.3 ± 5.6 Kg/m
