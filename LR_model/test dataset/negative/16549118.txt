Cadaveric transplantation activities in our centers. Baskent University is one of the most important transplantation centers in Turkey. This study assesses the contribution that Baskent University Hospital Network is currently making to the national solid organ pool. The National Coordinating Center (NCC) was founded in 2001, and data from the Baskent University transplantation center from January 2001 to through May 2005 were retrospectively analyzed. The number of brain-dead patients in this period was 36 and the number of family consent was 20. For all brain-death cases, the rate of consent for donation was 55.6%. Of the 64 total grafts collected in this study period, 85.9% were transplanted at this center and 14.1% were offered to the NCC. The rate of heart and liver grafts offered to the NCC was 9.4% and 4.7%, respectively. According to the results, 29.6% of all heart grafts, 4.5% of all liver grafts, and 4.5% of all kidney grafts in Turkey are performed from donors identified by Baskent University. The current rate of consent for cadaver organ donation is high compared with other centers. The majority of these grafts were used in our center, but we also made some contribution to the national donor organ pool. The transplantation activities in our network will hopefully lead to a larger organ pool and shorter waiting lists.
