Single-Beat Measurement of Left Ventricular Contractility in Normothermic Ex Situ Perfused Porcine Hearts. For heart transplantation, donor heart status needs to be evaluated during normothermic ex situ perfusion (ESHP). Left ventricular end-systolic elastance (E  E  E  This method effectively assesses left ventricular contractility during ESHP and predicts early post-transplant outcomes in the porcine model. Our approach is the first to quantify E
