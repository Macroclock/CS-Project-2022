Organ transplantation in the Madrid Autonomous Region. The Madrid Autonomous Region, a Spanish area with 6,200,000 inhabitants, has 7 hospitals authorized for organ transplantation, with 25 active programs for carrying out various transplantations: 18 for adults and 7 for children. Most of these hospitals are reference transplant centers for other Spanish regions. Between 715 and 760 transplantations are performed annually, which represents between 19% and 22% of Spanish activity. During 2007, 395 kidney, 220 liver, 55 heart, and 35 lung transplantations were performed, as well as 23 isolated or combination transplantations of other abdominal organs (pancreatic, intestinal, or multivisceral). Kidney, liver, heart, and children's intestinal transplant activity in 2007 represented 37%, 63%, 80%, and 100%, respectively, of all pediatric national activity. The Madrid Autonomous Region has a donation rate of 34.2 donors per million inhabitants. Of these, 30% are from non-heart-beating donors (NHBD), Maastrich criteria category 1 or 2. Various hospitals perform kidney, liver, and lung transplantations with these organs, representing 11% of the lung transplantations carried out in recent years, with this being a pioneer procedure worldwide. Despite the important transplant activity, we are working to increase donations, to improve organ donor detection and management protocols, as well as to reach a consensus on criteria to decrease the nonviability rates of potential transplant organs.
