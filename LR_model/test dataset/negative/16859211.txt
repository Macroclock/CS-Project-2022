[Heart transplant in "Nuevo Leon": the first 33 cases]. Heart failure is one of the most important causes of death worldwide. Heart transplant is the last effective alternative when the medical and surgical treatments have failed in patients with end stage heart failure, giving them an 80% one year survival rate. Unfortunately, during the outcome, the heart transplant patients can develop complications such as graft rejection and opportunistic infections because of the use of immunosuppressive therapy. In the present article we report the experience with 33 heart transplant patients. Our program not only has successfully transplanted patients with advanced age but, for the first time in Latin America we have transplanted patients assisted with the ambulatory Thoratec TLC II system. Even with limited resources, we have managed the same complications than other heart transplant programs, our 82% one year survival rate is similar than reports in medical literature.
