Changes in Outcomes of Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy Over 30 Years Following Heart Transplantation. This study investigated temporal changes in the demographics and the prognosis of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) over 30 years following heart transplantation (HTx). Effects of the changing HTx demographics on CAV outcomes, based on International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) classification of CAV, have been incompletely investigated. Patients who underwent HTx at the Montreal Heart Institute were classified according to the severity of CAV (CAV 0 is no presence of CAV; CAV 1 is mild, CAV 2 to 3 is moderate to severe) and era of HTx (early: 1983 to 1998; recent: 1999 to 2011). We compared the risk of progression, survival, and independent predictors of outcomes among the groups. A total of 298 patients were followed for 11.6 ± 6.6 years. Patients who received transplants in the early era exhibited a higher risk for progression from CAV 1 to a higher grade (adjusted odds ratio: 8.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01 to 62.6). The presence of CAV was associated with a significantly increased risk for all-cause mortality in the early era (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.1 to 2.5) but not in the recent era (HR: 1.1; 95% CI: 0.2 to 4.9). Regardless of the era, CAV classes 2 to 3 and CAV 1 were associated with a significantly increased risk for all-cause mortality compared to CAV 0 (HR: 6.5; 95% CI: 2.7 to 15.7; and HR: 1.750; 95% CI: 1.001 to 3.046, respectively). The progression and prognosis of CAV have improved over 30 years. The ISHLT CAV classification accurately and independently predicts long-term outcome following HTx.
