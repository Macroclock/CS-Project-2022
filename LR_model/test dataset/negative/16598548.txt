[Diabetes and heart transplantation]. Diabetes is frequently encountered in patients presenting with end-stage heart failure to be listed for transplantation. While diabetes used to be a contra-indication for heart transplantation, careful preoperative evaluation and individualized postoperative medication lead to long-term outcome after heart transplantation equal to non-diabetic patients. About 1/3 of transplanted patients develop a post-transplant diabetes. Several risk factors have been identified leading to this condition. Mostly, post-transplant diabetes is of temporary nature. Several studies have shown no impact of diabetes on the incidence of rejection, malignancies, and transplant vasculopathy. However, glucose intolerance must be taken into consideration when planing immunosuppressive therapy since different medications have distinct impact on glucose metabolism after transplant. A multidisciplinary team allows for closely monitoring and treating patients with diabetes after heart transplant.
