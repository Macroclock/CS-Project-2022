The Use of Left Ventricular Assist Devices in End-Stage Heart Failure. Heart failure is one of the most common diagnoses in patients requiring multiple hospitalizations. The use of mechanical circulatory support (both temporary and durable), especially left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), in this patient population has evolved over the last decade. There are thousands of durable LVADs implanted in the United States annually as bridge to transplantation, destination therapy, or bridge to recovery. LVAD therapy, just like cardiac transplantation, takes a multidisciplinary team approach to achieve success. Appropriate patient selection is the key to good clinical outcomes. As the technology of LVAD therapy continues to evolve, it will be made available to an increasing number of patients in an attempt to improve their morbidity and mortality.
