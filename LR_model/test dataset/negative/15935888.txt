Impact of ELISA-detected anti-HLA antibodies on pediatric cardiac allograft outcome. In this study, we determine whether the presence of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detected anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies correlates with acute and chronic rejection in pediatric heart transplantation (Tx). Forty-five patients, who had serial ELISA pre- and posttransplantation, were studied. Age at Tx was 8.2 +/- 7.2 years. Acute rejection (AR) was defined as International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Grade > or =3a. Patients were defined as rejectors (22 cases) if they had recurrent AR or steroid-resistant AR within the first year post-Tx; the other cases (23) were defined as nonrejectors. Overall, 219 samples were analyzed. Twenty-two of the 45 had pre- or post-Tx anti-HLA antibodies: 77% in rejectors (17/22) and only 22% in nonrejectors (5/23), p = 0.0002. Pre-Tx HLA antibodies were present in 12 cases (27%). Presensitization was more frequent in rejectors (11/22, 50%) than in nonrejectors (1/23, 4%, p = 0.0005). Nineteen cases retained (9 cases) or developed (10 cases) anti-HLA antibodies post-Tx: 14 in rejectors (63.6%) and 5 in nonrejectors (21.7%), p = 0.003. Four of eight cases with coronary artery disease (50%) had preformed anti-HLA antibodies compared with 8 of 37 without coronary artery disease (25.6%) (p = 0.09). Preformed, persistent, and de novo ELISA-detected anti-HLA antibodies were correlated with first-year acute rejection profile.
