Myocarditis: emergency department recognition and management. Myocarditis is an acute inflammatory syndrome involving the heart and related structures. In many instances, the presentation is obvious, and appropriate treatment and disposition follow accordingly. In other situations, patients present with viral illness of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts (or both) or nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and weakness,leading the clinician astray. Management is largely supportive, including aggressive cardiorespiratory support.
