Pre-operative risk factors and clinical outcomes associated with vasoplegia in recipients of orthotopic heart transplantation in the contemporary era. Patients who underwent orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) can develop vasoplegia, which is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Herein we examine the pre-operative risk in OHT recipients at our institution. We reviewed peri-operative data from 311 consecutive adult patients who underwent OHT between January 2003 and June 2008. Vasoplegia was defined as persistent low systemic vascular resistance, despite multiple intravenous pressor drugs at high dose, between 6 and 48 hours after surgery. In our cohort of 311 patients, 35 (11%) patients developed vasoplegia syndrome; these patients were more likely to be UNOS Status 1A, with a higher body surface area (1.8 ± 0.25 vs 1.63 ± 0.36, p = 0.0007), greater history of thyroid disease (38.2% vs 18.5%, p = 0.0075) and a higher rate of previous cardiothoracic surgery (79% vs 48%, p = 0.0006). Pre-operatively, they were more frequently treated with aspirin (73% vs 48%, p = 0.005) and mechanical assist devices (ventricular assist devices [VADs]: 45% vs 17%, p < 0.0001; total artificial hearts: 8.6% vs 0%, p < 0.0001), and less treated with milrinone (14.7% vs 45.8%, p = 0.0005). Bypass time (118 ± 37 vs 142 ± 39 minutes, p = 0.0002) and donor heart ischemic time (191 ± 46 vs 219 ± 51 minutes, p = 0.002) were longer, with higher mortality (3.2% vs 17.1%, p = 0.0003) and morbidity in the first 30 days after transplant. In the multivariate analysis, history of thyroid disease (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7, 95% CI 1.0 to 7.0, p = 0.04) and VAD prior to transplant (OR = 2.8, 95% CI 1.07 to 7.4, p = 0.03) were independent risk factors for development of vasoplegia syndrome. High body mass index, long cardiopulmonary bypass time, prior cardiothoracic surgery, mechanical support, use of aspirin, and thyroid disease are risk factors associated with development of vasoplegia syndrome.
