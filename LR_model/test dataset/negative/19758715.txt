Does heart rate predict allograft vasculopathy in heart transplant recipients? Experimental data suggest that heart rate is directly associated with the progression of atherosclerosis. We evaluated the prognostic importance of heart rate measured at rest 3 months after transplantation in 143 heart transplant recipients. During the follow-up (mean 9.5 years, range 2-23 years) 56 patients had coronary lesions. Survival without coronary lesion at angiography did not significantly differ between patients with a basal heart rate > or â‰¤97/min (median, p=0.44). This series does not support a prognostic influence of heart rate for cardiac allograft vasculopathy.
