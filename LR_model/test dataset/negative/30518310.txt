Burnout and Quality of Work Life Among Nurse Practitioners in Ventricular Assist Device Programs in the United States. A mixed-method study of role stress and work intensity among nurse practitioners (NPs) in mechanical circulatory support (MCS) programs in the United States reported a qualitative data related to burnout. We empirically investigated this phenomenon by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) describe levels of personal burnout (PB), work-related (WB) burnout, and client-related burnout (CB) and quality of work life (QOWL) among MCS-NPs; (2) determine the relationship between burnout and QOWL variables; and (3) identify which type of burnout is a predictor of QOWL. We employed an exploratory correlational research design. Demographics, work characteristics, and psychometrically robust measures of burnout and QOWL were completed by 47 MCS-NPs from various regions of the United States. Data were analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics. Higher levels of burnout (PB, WB, and CB) were associated with lower levels of QOWL ( Work-related burnout is negatively associated with low QOWL among NPs. Hospital/work environment was contributing factors to high burnout and low QOWL. Further research is needed to confirm the findings including the effect of burnout and QOWL on patient and ventricular assist device program outcomes.
