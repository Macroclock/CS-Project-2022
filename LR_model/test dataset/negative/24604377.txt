Staged and effortless explantation of CircuLite Synergy micropump. Synergy(®) micropump was implanted as a bridge to heart transplantation in a middle-age lady with chronic advanced heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy. After a good initial recovery, patient was discharged to ward, where her stay was prolonged due to non-healing operative wound over the micropump and recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding. After 3 months of therapy, the heart seemed to be recovered and the micropump was explanted. In view of the patient's bleeding tendency, the micropump was explanted in staged manner.
