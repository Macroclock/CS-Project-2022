Mechanical support for the failing cardiac allograft: a single-center experience. Mechanical support for pre-transplant stabilization is established, but its use in peri-operative graft failure (PGF) has not been well documented. With liberal acceptance criteria being used to enlarge the donor pool, an increased incidence of graft failure might be expected. We evaluated the incidence and outcome of PGF at our institution. A retrospective review of 462 consecutive adult heart transplants performed between January 1993 and December 1999 revealed 20 cases of PGF. Donor-, surgery- and device-related variables were evaluated for association with operative mortality, survival and successful device weaning. Transplant recipients included 17 men and 3 women, median age 56.5 years (20 to 66 years). PGF etiology included primary graft failure (n = 9); right heart failure (RHF) secondary to pulmonary hypertension, coagulopathy/intra-operative hemorrhage or sepsis (n = 9); and hyperacute rejection (n = 2). Device types included RVAD (n = 11), LVAD (n = 4), BIVAD (n = 3) and IABP (n = 2). The wean rate was 45%. Duration of device support ranged from 2 to 965 hours. Early ventricular recovery (within 96 hours) was associated with significantly better 30-day and 2-year survival. Weaned patients had an 88% 30-day and 67% 2-year survival, whereas the overall survival rate was 79% at 2 years (p = not significant). Early ventricular recovery is an important predictor of successful weaning and survival. In view of the prohibitive mortality associated with PGF and the dismal prognosis with re-transplantation, we advocate aggressive use of mechanical assistance for PGF, with an acceptable survival benefit.
