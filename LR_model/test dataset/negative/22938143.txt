Late primary cytomegalovirus infection presenting with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy in a heart transplant recipient: a case report and review of the literature. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is well recognized as a cause of morbidity and mortality in heart transplant recipients. Primary CMV infection can occur early post transplant in at-risk recipients with donor-derived infection, or any time after transplantation in community-acquired infection. We describe a unique case of primary CMV infection occurring 14Â years after cardiac transplantation. In addition to end-organ CMV disease, this patient developed a post-infectious neurologic phenomenon, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. This entity has rarely been reported in the solid organ transplant population.
