The temporary placement of endobronchial stents in the management of bronchial compression by transiently enlarged mediastinal structures. Enlargement of mediastinal structures can cause compression of the trachea and/or bronchi. We describe two case reports in which stenosis of left main bronchus, secondary to compression from an enlarged mediastinal structure, were successfully managed with temporary placement of a metallic self-expanding stent while waiting for the compression to relieve.
