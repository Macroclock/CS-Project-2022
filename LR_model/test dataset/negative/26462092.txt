Inequalities in the Access to Advanced Therapy in Heart Failure. At present, heart failure (HF) is a worldwide problem, characterized by a high morbidity and mortality. In industrialized countries or regions, such as the United States, Canada, and western European countries, HF has a prevalence of 1.5% to 2.7%. Chile represents a growing economy in Latin America; however, the relatively high cost of more advanced therapies, in addition to other variables (ie, adequate and timely evaluation by HF specialists), makes access difficult for patients with HF. In this article, the authors review the principal difficulties in accessing advanced HF therapies in Chile, as a model of developing country.
