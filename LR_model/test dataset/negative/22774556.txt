[An experience with cardiac transplantation with a single stage reduction of the left atrium cavity and correction of valvular disease]. The immediate and long-term results of cardiac transplantation with a reduction of the left atrium and correction of valvular diseases were performed on 4 patients with atriomegalia and associated valvular disease of the heart. There were no cases of hospital lethality. Within 7 days after operation the patients had a tendency to reducing the mean value of the left atrium. Within 38 months the tendency to normalization of the sizes, volumes and ejection fraction of the left atrium persisted. Cardiac autotransplantation is an effective method of a single stage reduction of the left atrium and correction of valvular diseases.
