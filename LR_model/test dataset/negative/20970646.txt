Adiponectin and graft vascular disease after cardiac transplantation. Graft vascular disease (GVD) is a form of accelerated atherosclerosis that involves the transplanted heart, affecting more than 40% of patients after follow-up of 5 years. According to some authors, adiponectin concentration is a prognostic factor for progression of coronary atherosclerosis. Following this line of research, the objective of the present study was to analyze the relationship between adiponectin concentration and development of GVD in 52 cardiac transplant recipients. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to findings at intravascular ultrasound: group 1 with 21 patients without GVD, and group 2 with 31 patients with GVD. Patients with GVD were further divided into 2 additional groups according to results of coronary angiography: group 3 with 35 patients without GVD, and group 4 with 17 patients with any degree of GVD. No significant differences (P=.50) were observed insofar as adiponectin concentration between groups 1 and 2, and groups 3 and 4. Significant differences in adiponectin concentration were observed when the sex of the patient was considered (P=.002), with higher concentrations detected in women. Serious cardiac events were more common in patients with GVD (P=.001). Mean time between transplantation and diagnosis of GVD was 67 months in group 1, 107 months in group 2, 71 months in group 3, and 101 months in group 4. Significant differences were observed between groups 1 and 2 (P=.030).
