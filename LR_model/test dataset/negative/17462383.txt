Medically refractory pulmonary hypertension: treatment with nonpulsatile left ventricular assist devices. Severe pulmonary hypertension refractory to medical treatment is a contraindication to orthotopic heart transplantation in most centers. We report our experience in treating severe pulmonary hypertension with mechanical left ventricular unloading using implantable nonpulsatile left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) with continuous flow properties. In ten patients with severe pulmonary hypertension, refractory to medical treatment, an implantable nonpulsatile LVAD was placed for continuous mechanical left ventricular support. Pulmonary hemodynamics were assessed by right heart catheterization prior to and during LVAD implantation, and after orthotopic heart transplantation. The mean (+/-SD) interval of nonpulsatile support was 182 (+/-118) days. Pulmonary artery pressure (mean +/- SD) significantly decreased from 42 +/- 13 to 24 +/- 5 mm Hg (p < 0.005), the transpulmonary gradient (mean +/- SD) decreased from 20 +/- 6 to 11 +/-5 mm Hg (p < 0.005), and the pulmonary vascular resistance (mean +/- SD) from 4.8 +/- 1.8 to 2.2 +/- 0.8 Wood units (p < 0.005) during an interval of one to six months of LVAD support. No significant increases in pulmonary artery pressure, transpulmonary gradient, and pulmonary vascular resistance were observed during an interval of three to six months after orthotopic heart transplantation. This study supports that LVAD support and continuous nonpulsatile mechanical unloading of the left ventricle can reverse medically unresponsive pulmonary hypertension and render patients eligible for orthotopic heart transplantation.
