Successful orthotopic heart transplantation using a donor heart with ALCAPA. With the imbalance between donation rates and potential recipients growing, transplant programs are increasingly using non-ideal organs from so-called marginal donors. This is the first reported case of the intentional use of a donor heart with ALCAPA. The recipient was aged one yr with restrictive cardiomyopathy who had been supported with BiVAD for over six months. Function of the donor left ventricle was shown to be well preserved, with no obvious signs of ischemia, except for a fibrotic layer on the anterolateral papillary muscle of the mitral valve. To prevent coronary steal, the anomalous left coronary artery ostium from the MPA was oversewn prior to implantation. The transplanted heart spontaneously regained sinus rhythm immediately following cross-clamp release and showed good contractility from the first postoperative echocardiogram. The patient continues to do well 18 months post-transplant, with excellent function on echocardiography, and good flow on coronary angiography.
