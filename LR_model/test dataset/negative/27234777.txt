Heart Transplantation Under Mechanical Circulatory Support for Acute Fulminant Myocarditis With Cardiogenic Shock: 10Â Years' Experience of a Single Center. Acute fulminant myocarditis with intractable cardiogenic shock is a fatal condition; its only therapeutic option is mechanical circulatory support. The use of mechanical circulatory support, either extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or a ventricular assist device (VAD), serves as a bridge to recovery or as a bridge to transplantation. The aim of this research was to advance our understanding of the outcome of heart transplantation under mechanical support for acute myocarditis. Two groups of patients were compared: those recovered without undergoing transplantation and those who underwent transplantation. We reviewed 134 patients experiencing acute myocarditis who required mechanical circulatory support (including ECMO and/or VAD) in our institute between 1994 and 2014. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, support duration, and outcome of individuals were retrospectively analyzed. Patients taking part in this study were aged from 1 month to 70 years, with an average age of 28 years. The transplantation-free survival rate in adults was 54%. A total of 6 adult patients receive a heart transplant under ECMO/left VAD; 2 of these patients died of uncontrolled sepsis after the heart transplantation. The duration of mechanical support ranged from 10 to 130 days (average, 41 days). Mechanical circulatory support in patients with acute myocarditis proved to be effective. Approximately one half of all adult patients in this study experienced myocardium recovery under mechanical support, with only 5% undergoing a successful heart transplantation. In terms of patients who survived after heart transplantation, the mid-term and long-term outcomes are favorable.
