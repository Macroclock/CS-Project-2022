Early use of PCSK9 inhibitor therapy after heart transplantation from a hepatitis C virus positive donor. Although statin therapy is a primary treatment to prevent cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), its use may be delayed due to pharmacologic interactions in the early post-transplant period among heart transplant (HT) recipients with hepatitis C virus positive (HCV+) donors. Further examination of the possible benefits of early, nonstatin lipid-lowering therapies (LLT), such as PCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9i), among this specific subset of transplant recipients is therefore becoming increasingly important. We report a 60-year-old man who received a HT from a HCV+ donor for end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy. In the early post-transplant period, there was concern for drug-drug interactions between statin, immunosuppressant, and direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. In addition, prior to transplant, he reported statin-associated muscle symptoms in response to multiple statins, which persisted despite attempts to re-challenge and use an every-other-day dosing strategy. Therefore, the patient was started on PCSK9i therapy after transplantation and while receiving curative DAA therapy for HCV. As the number of HT recipients of HCV+ donors continue to rise, investigation into the safety and benefits of early use of PCSK9i for the reduction of CAV and improved cardiovascular and mortality outcomes should be pursued.
