[Diagnosis, prevention and treatment of cardiac allograft vasculopathy]. The major limitation of long-term survival after cardiac transplantation is allograft vasculopathy, which consists of concentric and diffuse intimal hyperplasia. The disease still has a significant incidence, estimated at 30% five years after cardiac transplantation. It is a clinically silent disease and so diagnosis is a challenge. Coronary angiography supplemented by intravascular ultrasound is the most sensitive diagnostic method. However, new non-invasive diagnostic techniques are likely to be clinically relevant in the future. The earliest possible diagnosis is essential to prevent progression of the disease and to improve its prognosis. A new nomenclature for allograft vasculopathy has been published in July 2010, developed by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT), establishing a standardized definition. Simultaneously, the ISHLT published new guidelines standardizing the diagnosis and management of cardiac transplant patients. This paper reviews contemporary concepts in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of allograft vasculopathy, highlighting areas that are the subject of ongoing research.
