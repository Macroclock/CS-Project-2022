Rupture of inlet graft of the HeartMate System: a case report. As the implantation of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as destination therapy for patients with heart failure increases in frequency, device durability and malfunction present an increasing concern. Complications such as inflow valve regurgitation, outflow valve distortion, and problems with power cable or pump motors place the LVAD recipient at increased risk for morbidity and mortality. To offset the risk of complications related to the inflow cannula, modifications to the valve conduit were made to the SNAP VE device in November 2002. These modifications were intended to improve durability with cycle performance of up to 6 times longer than the old inflow valve during in vitro testing. We describe here a patient who sustained disruption of the Dacron inlet graft after implantation of the Heart-Mate XVE System as a destination therapy.
