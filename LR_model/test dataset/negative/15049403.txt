Intravenous desensitization to allopurinol in a heart transplant patient with gout. Oral desensitization with allopurinol presents a problem for patients with allopurinol hypersensitivity and gout that needs to be controlled rapidly. To our knowledge, only 1 case report of intravenous (i.v.) desensitization has been previously published. To present a case report of a patient with cutaneous reactions to allopurinol who underwent i.v. allopurinol desensitization. Intravenous infusion of allopurinol was performed using an escalating, 19-dose protocol. No adverse reactions were precipitated by 2 i.v., escalating dose procedures, allowing continuation of effective treatment of the patient's hyperuricemia. This case of safe and effective desensitization with allopurinol by the i.v. route should emphasize the need for a trial of this protocol in additional patients in whom rapid desensitization would be advantageous.
