Long-term experience using CNI-free immunosuppression in selected paediatric heart transplant recipients. CNI-free immunosuppression with conversion to mTORi-based immunosuppression has been demonstrated to reduce CNI-toxicity and to exhibit anti-proliferative properties. However, the experience of CNI-free immunosuppression in paediatric heart transplantation is limited. A retrospective analysis was conducted of 129 paediatric heart transplants performed between 1997 and 2015. Fifteen patients with clinically indicated conversion from CNI-based to CNI-free immunosuppression were identified. Survival data, rejection episodes, renal function, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder and CAV, including examination with OCT were analysed. Immunosuppression conversion was successful in all patients. Fourteen of 15 patients (93%) are currently living with good graft function. Median post-transplant survival was 15 years (range, 5-23 years), and median follow-up since conversion was 6 years (range, 1-11 years). Mild (grade 1R) ACR was present in three patients after discontinuation of CNIs. The recovery of renal function with a significant increase in eGFR was observed at 1 and 3 years after conversion. No patient had angiographic signs of macroscopic CAV according to the current ISHLT classification; however, OCT showed the signs of angiographically silent CAV in all patients. CAV did not progress in any patient, implying CAV was stabilised by mTORi-based CNI-free immunosuppression. CNI-free immunosuppression based on mTORis is a safe and appropriate strategy for maintenance therapy in selected paediatric patients, significantly improves renal function and stabilises CAV. OCT revealed early development of angiographically silent CAV. 'CAV', 'CNI-free immunosuppression', 'OCT', 'chronic kidney injury', 'pediatric heart transplantation'
