Leakage of the arterial prosthesis of an Impella RVAD. Seromas occurring around a vascular graft are a rare complication. We report a life-threatening plasma leakage that occurred through the polytetrafluoroethylene vascular prosthesis of an Impella right ventricular assist device (Impella RD [Impella Cardiosystems GmbH, Aachen, Germany]) implanted in a 62-year-old patient with acute right ventricular failure after cardiac transplantation. The leakage became progressively massive. Weaning the patient from the right ventricular assist device was not possible. The prosthesis was thus wrapped within a pericardial patch to contain the leakage. Three days later the patient could be successfully weaned and the pump was removed. The clinical evolution was favorable.
