Triazolopyrimidine derivative NK026680 and donor-specific transfusion induces CD4 We have previously demonstrated the unique properties of a new triazolopyrimidine derivative, NK026680, which exerts immunosuppressive effects in rat heart transplant model and confers tolerogeneic properties on ex vivo-conditioned dendritic cells in mice. We herein demonstrate that NK026680 promotes the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) with potent immunoregulatory effects when used in combination with donor-specific transfusion (DST).
