Disseminated cat-scratch disease presenting as nausea, diarrhea, and weight loss without fever in a heart transplant recipient. We report the case of an afebrile 59-year-old heart transplant recipient presenting with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and diffuse lymphadenopathy. Lymph node biopsies revealed non-caseating granulomatous inflammation. Cat-scratch disease was confirmed by serologic studies, Warthin-Starry staining, and polymerase chain reaction testing of lymph node tissue. The patient's symptoms resolved with 3 months of doxycycline. We review clinical presentations of Bartonella henselae infection and review diagnostic approaches for B. henselae in this patient population.
