Effect of percutaneous ventricular assist devices on renal function. Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are used to improve the systemic circulation and to decrease ventricular loading in patients with hemodynamic instability that is refractory to pharmacologic therapies. During an acute critical event, percutaneous devices are preferred because of their rapid deployment, since implantable devices require more extensive procedures. Implantable devices are used for patients with established end-stage heart failure as a bridge to heart transplantation, recovery or destination therapy. This report reviews mechanical principles and clinical studies regarding percutaneous VAD to address their potential renal effects. Since the focus of this study is set on devices that are dedicated to cardiac support only, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation systems are not included.
