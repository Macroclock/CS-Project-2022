Between-center disparities in access to heart transplantation in France: contribution of candidate and center factors - A comprehensive cohort study. Transplantation represents the last option for patients with advanced heart failure. We assessed between-center disparities in access to heart transplantation in France 1 year after registration and evaluated the contribution of factors to these disparities. Adults (n = 2347) registered on the French national waiting list between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014, in the 23 transplant centers were included. Associations between candidate and transplant center characteristics and access to transplantation were assessed by proportional hazards frailty models. Candidate blood groups O and A, sensitization, and body mass index ≥30 kg/m 'access to transplantation', 'heart allocation system', 'heart transplantation', 'proportional hazards frailty models'
