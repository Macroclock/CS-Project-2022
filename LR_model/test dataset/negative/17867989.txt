Association of amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen and acute myocardial rejection in male patients receiving heart transplantation. The amino-terminal propeptides of type I and III procollagens (PINP and PIIINP) are markers reflecting the status of collagen turnover. We hypothesized that measurement of these serum procollagen propeptides could be used to non-invasively assess acute rejection in heart transplant recipients. In heart transplant recipients, endomyocardial biopsy specimens taken at 6 and 12 months after surgery were used for study. PINP and PIIINP were measured postoperatively at 3, 6, and 12 months. A total of 20 male heart transplant patients and seven male control subjects were enrolled. Five patients showed rejection 6 months after transplantation (group 1), while 15 patients showed no rejection (group 2). In group 2 patients, serum PINP and PIIINP levels decreased significantly 6 months after transplantation. In contrast, elevation of serum PINP and PIIINP levels persisted in group 1 patients 6 months after transplantation. At 6 months after transplantation, group 1 patients had significantly higher PIIINP levels than group 2 patients (p=0.025) and controls (p=0.003). After immunosuppressive therapy, all group 1 patients were free of rejection 12 months after transplantation and serial serum PIIINP levels decreased significantly in these patients. Serum PIIINP levels represent a non-invasive method to reflect the occurrence and resolution of acute rejection.
