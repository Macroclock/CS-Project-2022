Cardiotoxicity with Itraconazole. Itraconazole is a commonly used antifungal drug. In addition to commonly described adverse effects, there have been few reports of heart failure with its use. We present two cases that developed acute systolic heart failure with Itraconazole use. A man in his early 30s was admitted with worsening leg swelling and dyspnoea on exertion. He had been on Itraconazole for blastomyces skin ulcer. His ejection fraction (EF) was found to be 10%-15%. Another man in his 50s was admitted with similar symptoms; his EF was 40%-45%. He had been on Itraconazole for forearm cellulitis. No other aetiology was identified in both patients despite extensive work-up including cardiac catheterisation. Itraconazole was stopped in both the cases. Our first patient did not improve even months after cessation of therapy and was referred for heart transplant. Our second patient improved after a few weeks, and his ejection fraction had improved on repeat testing. 'Heart failure', 'Unwanted effects / adverse reactions'
