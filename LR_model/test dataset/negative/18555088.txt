Enteric-coated mycophenolate-sodium in heart transplantation: efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic compared with mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is an effective immunosuppressive treatment for renal transplant recipients, but its effective use and best practice are not established in cardiac transplantation. This multicenter, single-blind, randomized, parallel group clinical trial prospectively evaluated the therapeutic equivalence of enteric-coated mycophenolate-sodium (EC-MPS) versus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in combination with cyclosporine (CyA) and steroids as determined by the primary objective of treatment efficacy during the first 6 months of treatment in 154 de novo heart transplant recipients. Both groups received equivalent doses of MPA, either 720 mg b.i.d EC-MPS or 1000 mg b.i.d MMF. EC-MPS showed a comparable efficacy and safety profile compared with MMF with significantly less dose reduction. Treatment failure occurred in 57.7% and 60.5% with EC-MPS and MMF, respectively, EC-MPS was therapeutically equivalent to MMF in cardiac transplantation.
