[Mechanical assist devices in advanced heart failure. Indications and perspectives]. Congestive heart failure is recognized as a major public health issue and is the leading cause of death in western countries. Heart transplantation currently remains the gold standard option for end-stage heart failure patients. Heart transplantation is also one of the most limited therapies, not only with regard to the lack of donor hearts but also because of the surgical limitations inherent to the clinical aspects of this severely ill patient population. Mechanical circulatory support systems have been developed as effective adjuvant therapeutic options in these terminally ill patients. Over the past two decades, mechanical circulatory support devices have steadily evolved in the clinical management of end-stage heart failure, and have emerged as a standard of care for the treatment of acute and chronic heart failure refractory to conventional medical therapy. Future blood pumps should be smaller and totally implantable, as well as more efficient, biocompatible, and reliable.
