Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to cardiopulmonary bypass with a single circuit exposure. Due to the short supply of donor organs available, many patients decompensate or die while waiting for transplantation. Options for mechanical support for infants and pediatrics with congenital heart disease are limited because of the patient's size and device availability. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is the most common means of cardiac and respiratory support for these patients. One of the many indications for ECMO use in cardiac patients is as a bridge to transplantation, with patients being transported to the operating room (OR) on ECMO support. Converting the ECMO circuit to an open cardiopulmonary bypass system in the OR minimizes the patient's exposure to new circuitry, decreases further donor exposures and provides continuous support for patients in cardiac and/or respiratory failure. In addition, the ability to use modified ultrafiltration post-bypass aids in reducing extracellular fluid, increasing the hematocrit and improving hemodynamic stability following an extended duration of ECMO and bypass support. The integrity of the ECMO circuit is maintained and can be converted back to ECMO for support postoperatively if needed.
