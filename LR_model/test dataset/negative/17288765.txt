[Comparison between pre- and post-transplant diagnosis of end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy]. To evaluate the discrepancy between pre- and post-transplant diagnosis of end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy, a pre-transplantation diagnosis was compared with the diagnosis made after macroscopic and microscopic examination of the explanted hearts in 40 cardiac transplant recipients who had undergone cardiac transplantation at our institute. Pre-operation echocardiograms were obtained in all patients and coronary angiogram was obtained in 9 patients who had significant risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD was considered present when there was a 75% reduction in cross-sectional luminal area of >or= 1 major coronary artery. Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) was diagnosed when ventricular dilation and global reduction in ventricular systolic function were present in the absence of any identifiable cause. IDC patients with an alcohol consumption of > 100 g/day during the last 12 months before the onset of congestive heart failure were classified as having alcoholic cardiomyopathy. The pathological diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy was formulated in the presence of gross/or histological evidence of regional or diffuse transmural fatty or fibrofatty infiltration of the right ventricular free wall. Before transplantation, 45.0%, 17.5%, 17.5% and 7.5% of patients were classified as IDC, CHD, alcoholic cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Post-transplant CHD diagnosis was made in all patients with a pre-transplant diagnosis of CHD. Post-transplant CHD diagnosis was also established in 4 patients with a pre-transplant diagnosis of IDC, in 4 patients with presumptive alcoholic cardiomyopathy, in 1 patient with hypertensive cardiomyopathy and in 1 patient with a pre-transplant diagnosis of aortic valve disease. Post-transplant arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy diagnosis was made in 6 patients with a pre-transplant diagnosis of IDC or KaShan disease. Post-transplant giant cell myocarditis diagnosis was made in 1 patient with a pre-transplant diagnosis of IDC. Post-transplant CHD diagnosis is significantly higher than that of pre-transplant (42.5% vs. 17.5%, P < 0.05). Part of these patients might benefit from bypass surgery or PCI. Therefore, "in-depth" search for a heart failure cause, especially the coronary angiography examination, should be conducted in all heart transplantation candidates due to heart failure, regardless of their clinical presentation.
