Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy is an inherited cardiomyopathy characterised by ventricular arrhythmias and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy diagnosis is based on criteria that take into account electrical and structural cardiac abnormalities, as well as mutation analysis. Appropriate pharmacological therapy and the prevention of sudden death with implantable defibrillators are important in the management of these patients. Exercise is considered an important environmental factor for the development and progression of the disease.
