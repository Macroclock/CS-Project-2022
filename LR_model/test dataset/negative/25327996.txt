Fetal and neonatal imaging and strategy of primary neonatal heart transplantation in hypoplastic left heart with Ebstein's anomaly. We present the anatomic constellation of mitral stenosis/aortic atresia variant of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Ebstein's anomaly, and partial anomalous pulmonary venous return, an exceeding rare congenital heart defect. Prenatal echocardiography led to concern about the capacity of the right ventricle to increase cardiac output with lung expansion and pulmonary arterial runoff at birth, prompting the precaution of extracorporeal membrane oxygenator standby at delivery. Stage I palliation was not attempted, and control of pulmonary arterial blood flow was achieved with pulmonary artery banding, allowing sufficient ongoing hemodynamic stability. Orthotopic cardiac transplantation, repair of hypoplastic aortic arch, and primary sutureless repair of left pulmonary veins was performed, using dual-site arterial cannulation and continuous mild hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. We discuss how this unique echocardiographic anatomy influenced the surgical decision and point out how it guided therapy toward a strategy of primary transplantation rather than standard staged surgical palliation.
