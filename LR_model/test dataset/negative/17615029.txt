Dental hygiene procedure in a patient with Giardia lamblia infection. Giardiasis, or Giardia lamblia infection, is the most common parasitosis of the human digestive tract. It is highly contagious and mostly occurs in warm climates. Children are especially susceptible to infection. MICROBIOLOGICAL FEATURES: The infection can sporadically occur anywhere and waterborne outbreaks have been reported in some countries. Hence, the prevention of giardiasis depends on proper sanitation. Once ingested through contaminated water, Giardia cysts adhere to the intestinal surface. The parasite feeds on the mucous secretions of the intestine and may produce severe infections which can interfere with nutrient absorption. Symptoms in affected individuals usually include diarrhoea, dehydration, stomach cramps, gas, and weight loss. Diagnosis is based on the detection of cysts in fecal samples. Treatment includes the use of metronidazole and other drugs that are effective in clearing the infection within a few days. We report the recent case of a patient with Giardiasis who received dental hygiene procedures and discuss the interventions required in consideration of the patient's concomitant heart condition.
