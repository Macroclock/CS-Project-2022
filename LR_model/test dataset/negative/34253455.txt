COVID-19 diagnosis and testing in pediatric heart transplant recipients. Pediatric heart transplant recipients have been expected to be at higher risk of adverse events from developing COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 RNA PCR and antibody testing has been performed in our cohort of patients since March 15, 2020 and outcomes were reviewed. COVID-19 infection in our population of pediatric heart transplant recipients is common (21%), despite recommendations to avoid contact with others. Asymptomatic COVID-19 infection is common as well (55%). Despite the frequency of infection, COVID-19 is well tolerated in this population (5% admission from home; 0% mortality). A suppressed immune system does not significantly inhibit an antibody response in pediatric heart transplant recipients (>70% antibody seroconversion) and appears to persist, similar to those without transplantation (>90 days). Routine testing for COVID-19 via PCR and antibody testing enhances the ability to detect COVID-19 infection in asymptomatic patients and may help reduce unintended transmission to more susceptible individuals.
