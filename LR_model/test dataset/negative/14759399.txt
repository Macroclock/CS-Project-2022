Comparison of survival and other complications after heart transplantation in patients taking amiodarone before surgery versus those not taking amiodarone. Concern exists regarding preoperative amiodarone use and complications occurring after heart transplantation (HT). During a 10-year period of performing HT, we found that patients treated with amiodarone before undergoing HT had decreased overall survival, required longer periods of ventilatory support, and were at increased risk for significant bleeding complications. These findings raise further concern about the use of amiodarone treatment in patients with heart failure before undergoing HT.
