Use of Intra-aortic Balloon Pump as a Bridge to Heart Transplant in Spain: Results From the ASIS-TC Study. In Spain, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) has been used frequently as a bridge to urgent heart transplant (HT). We sought to analyze the clinical outcomes of this strategy. We conducted a case-by-case, retrospective review of clinical records of 281 adult patients listed for urgent HT under IABP support in 16 Spanish institutions from 2010 to 2015. Pre- and post-transplant survival and adverse clinical events were analyzed. A total of 194 (69%, 95%CI, 63.3-74.4) patients were transplanted and 20 (7.1%, 95%CI, 4.4-10.8) died during a mean period of IABP support of 10.9±9.7 days. IABP support was withdrawn before an organ became available in 32 (11.4%) patients. Thirty-five (12.5%, 95%CI, 8.8-16.9) patients transitioned from IABP to full-support mechanical devices. Mean urgent waiting list time increased from 5.9±6.3 days in 2010 to 15±11.7 days in 2015 (P=.001). Post-transplant survival rates at 30-days, 1-year, and 5-years were 88.1% (95%CI, 85.7-90.5), 76% (95%CI, 72.9-79.1), and 67.8% (95%CI, 63.7-71.9), respectively. The incidence rate of major adverse clinical outcomes-device dysfunction, stroke, bleeding or infection-during IABP support was 26 (95%CI, 20.6-32.4) episodes per 1000 patient-days. The incidence rate of IABP explantation due to complications was 7.2 (95%CI, 4.5-10.8) cases per 1000 patient-days. In a setting of short waiting list times, IABP can be used to bridge candidates to urgent HT with acceptable postoperative results, but there were significant rates of adverse clinical events during support.
