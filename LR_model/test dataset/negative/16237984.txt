Clinical and angiographic outcomes of cardiac transplant patients treated with intracoronary beta-radiation for in-stent restenosis: a case series. Vascular brachytherapy (VBT) is effective for the treatment of in-stent restenosis (ISR), however, the effect of VBT clinical and angiographic outcomes of patients with ISR who have undergone orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) requires further study. All OHT patients with ISR treated with VBT using the Novoste Beta-Cath System at Rush University Medical Center were identified, and the clinical and angiographic outcomes were evaluated. Four OHT patients with ISR who underwent VBT were identified. The mean age was 48.5 years, and the mean duration posttransplantation was 7.5 years. The mean reference coronary vessel diameter was 3.06 mm. The primary interventional device utilized prior to VBT was cutting balloon angioplasty (CBA) in 75% and percutaneous balloon angioplasty in 25%. The mean duration of follow-up after VBT was 11 months. There were no deaths attributable due to cardiac disease, no myocardial infarction, and no target vessel revascularization on follow-up. Overall survival during this period was 75%, with one mortality due to stroke 8 months after VBT. VBT for the treatment of ISR in patients who have undergone OHT appears safe and feasible and is associated with acceptable clinical and angiographic outcomes.
