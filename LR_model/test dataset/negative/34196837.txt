Vasoplegia from Continuous Flow Left Ventricular Assist Devices. The contribution of continuous flow left ventricular assist devices (c-LVAD) to vasoplegic syndrome and postoperative outcomes after orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) is contested in the literature. A standardized definition of vasoplegic syndrome (VS) is needed to better recognize and manage vasoplegic shock. Vasoplegic syndrome occurs after orthotopic heart transplant more frequently than after other surgeries requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. c-LVADs lead to small vessel endothelial dysfunction and desensitized adrenal receptors; however, their contribution to the development of vasoplegia is debated in clinical studies. Pulsatility may mitigate vascular dysfunction resulting from long-term continuous flow, and should be further explored in the clinical setting when considering risk factors for vasoplegic syndrome. The incidence of vasoplegic syndrome after orthotopic heart transplant is rising with the increasing use of c-LVAD bridge to therapy. Robust clinical studies are needed to advance our understanding and approach to mitigating VS after OHT.
