[Anaesthesia for noncardiac surgery in a heart-transplanted patient: a clinical case and review of the literature]. The number and the overall survival rate of heart transplant patients are increasing. Some of these patients undergo general surgery other than heart transplant on a regular basis. Anesthesia may be difficult in these patients because of the physiological characteristics of the denervated heart and of the management of immunosuppressive therapy on the basis of the risk of rejection and infection. Our study aims to discuss the anesthetic management of a 60-year-old heart-transplant patient undergoing abdominal hernia repair surgery and to write a literature review.
