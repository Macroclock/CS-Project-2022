Increase in atrial size in long-term survivors of heart transplant. Atrial size in recipients of orthotopic heart transplant (OHTX) who have long-term survival is not well described in the literature. We reviewed 2-dimensional echocardiograms of 14 recipients of OHTX who survived at least 5 years. Apical 4-chamber images were used for measurements starting at 1-year post-OHTX. The recipients of OHTX were 8 (57%) men and 6 (43%) women with a mean age of 43.6 +/- 12.1 (20-60) years and mean survival of 9.5 +/- 2.6 (5.8-14.4) years. All chambers increased with time post-OHTX (r > 0.83, P <.002). The changes in left atrium (LA) and right atrium (RA), remnants of donor LA and RA, and remnants of recipients' LA areas correlated inversely with patient survival post-OHTX (r > 0.83, P <.002). The change in RA recipient remnant area did not correlate with survival (r = 0.58, P =.06). In recipients of OHTX with long-term survival, there is a significant correlation between the echocardiographic size of LA and RA, and donor and recipient remnants with time and survival.
