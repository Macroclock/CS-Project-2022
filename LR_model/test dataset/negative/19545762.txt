Tumor lysis syndrome occurring after the administration of rituximab for posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) may occur after the administration of rituximab for lymphoproliferative disorders.

Because rituximab is being used more frequently, it is important for transplant physicians to be aware of this potential complication particularly after administering the first dose.
