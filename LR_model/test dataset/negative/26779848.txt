Prognostic significance of reactive pulmonary hypertension in patients with chronic heart failure listed for elective heart transplantation. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is recognised in about 60% of patients referred for heart transplantation (HTx), and it influences the patient's prognosis. To assess the prognostic value of reactive PH in patients listed for elective HTx. A total of 522 patients were enlisted from the Polish National Registry (POLKARD), listed for HTx, in whom complete haemodynamic data were reported. The endpoint was all-cause death before HTx. Heart transplantation, elective or urgent, was considered as an end of the follow-up (mean follow-up 1.47 ± 1.26 years). Patients were divided into three subgroups: no PH, passive PH, reactive PH taking into account mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) of 25 mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) 15 mm Hg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) 3.0 Wood units. Haemodynamic, clinical, echocardiographic, and biochemical assessments (including NT-proBNP, hs-CRP) were performed. The Heart Failure Survival Score (HFSS) was calculated. Estimated death rate was comparable between patients with no PH, passive PH, and reactive PH, despite the fact that the patients with reactive PH had the worst pulmonary haemodynamic scores (mean PAP 38.4 ± 7.8, PCWP 27 ± 7.4 mm Hg and PVR 4.8 ± 1.7 Wood units). In patients with reactive PH, in multifactor Cox analysis only the serum Na level influenced survival. According to the Kaplan-Meier method, patients with reactive PH, with mean PAP ≥ 41.4 mm Hg had the worst prognosis, estimated survival was: one year - 83%, two years - 65%. Reactive PH is common among patients with chronic HF listed to HTx (28%). It has no further influence on short-term prognosis as compared with patients with no PH and passive PH. Serum Na concentration and mean PAP ≥ 41.4 mm Hg influence the prognosis of patients with reactive PH. 'heart transplantation', 'pulmonary hypertension'
