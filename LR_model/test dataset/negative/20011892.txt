Heart transplantation in primary amyloidosis. Cardiac amyloidosis is a disease with a gloom life expectancy after the beginning of the symptomatic phase, usually with sudden death as the final event. The aggression to other organs, although, can make heart transplantation a disputable form of treatment taking into consideration the shortage of donor organs. The aim is to report the evolution with a survival of seven years after heart transplantation and in very fair condition of a patient with amyloidosis. One year after the heart transplantation, there was indication of renal transplantation also from the aggression from the disease. This patient compares' favorable with three other patients also from our service, who died early after de diagnosis. Even considering the multi systemic nature of amyloidosis, we can accept that in peculiar patients justified the heart transplantation, taking in the consideration the very bad prognosis of the disease.
