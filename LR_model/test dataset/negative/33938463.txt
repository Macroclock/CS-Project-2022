Mechanical circulatory support in pre and postheart transplant period. Progression of heart failure (HF) and its unpredictable and volatile nature, often requires advanced therapies including heart transplant. Mechanical circulatory support plays an integral part in the advanced treatment options. This technology can be deployed in several ways, particularly in the preparation and patient optimization for heart transplants. This article discusses the use of temporary and durable devices and their deployment strategies in the pre and posttransplant period. Recently temporary mechanical support devices have allowed us to improve survival to transplant as well as posttransplant. Early implementation of temporary devices both for stabilization of advanced HF patients being considered for transplant as well as those with posttransplant primary graft dysfunction (although utilization of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has repeatedly shown to be associated with worse outcomes compared to the other devices discussed), is reflective of the degree of disease progression in these patients. The outcomes of patients supported with durable devices have significantly improved with advancing technology. HeartMate 3 device has not only been shown to improve survival as well as the quality of life but in comparison to its predecessor, has been shown to decrease the morbidity associated with this technology. Both temporary and durable devices are now associated with improved survival and allow us to transplant patients in a more stable and safer manner with fewer adverse events. Based on the new United Network of Organ Sharing allocation system, it allows us to upgrade those who do not have the luxury of time to wait for a transplant. Primary graft dysfunction now also can be assisted with those devices, which is reflected in improved survival of posttransplant patients.
