Spanish Heart Transplant Registry. 30th Official Report of the Spanish Society of Cardiology Working Group on Heart Failure (1984-2018). The present report updates the clinical characteristics and outcomes of heart transplant in Spain to 2018. Prospective registry of all the heart transplants performed between 1984 and 2018 in Spain. Specifically, temporal trends in clinical characteristics and outcomes are described for the period from 2009 to 2017. In 2018, 321 transplants were performed (8494 since 1984; 2719 between 2009 and 2018). Compared with the previous year, the number of transplants performed in 2018 rose by 52% in recipients younger than 16 years and by 42% in those older than 60 years. In the last decade, significant temporal trends were observed in recipient characteristics (better pretransplant renal function, higher rates of diabetes, more urgent transplants, and greater use of pretrasplant circulatory support, particularly ventricular assist devices), donor characteristics (higher donor age, more female donors, and higher frequencies of cerebrovascular cause of death and predonation cardiac arrest and lower ischemia time). Survival significantly improved in the last decade, mainly due to lower mortality due to primary graft failure. The number of heart transplants is increasing in Spain, with a progressive improvement in survival. 'Heart transplant', 'Registro', 'Registry', 'Supervivencia', 'Survival', 'Trasplante cardiaco'
