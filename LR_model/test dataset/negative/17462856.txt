[Postinfarction management]. Postinfarction management of patients must be individualized. The essential prognostic factor is the ejection fraction, measured at one month. The four basic drugs to be used in combination are antithrombotics, beta-blockers, converting enzyme inhibitors and statins. The objective of treatment is to reach the dose regimens used in clinical trials. Cardiovascular rehabilitation and treatment education must be proposed widely to improve control of risk factors, explain the role of each drug prescribed and teach the appropriate use of nitroglycerin and of emergency medical services. Indications for myocardial revascularization depend on the coronary anatomy. Indications for an implantable defibrillator and for cardiac replacement depend on the ejection fraction and on the existence of heart failure uncontrolled by drug treatment.
