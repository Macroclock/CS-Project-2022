Human interleukin-10 transduced fetal liver stem cells prolong survival of mouse skin and heart allografts. Interleukin (IL)-10 regulates immune responses, acting as a suppressive cytokine by inhibiting the synthesis of Th1 cytokines, such as IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma. It also strongly down-regulates major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II determinants on antigen presenting cells (APC). On the other hand, long-term tolerance is well correlated with the persistence of a peripheral microchimerism. In this study, we investigated the synergistic effect of human IL-10 (huIL-10) and hematopoietic microchimerism for the induction of long-term tolerance. Irradiated Balb/c mice (H-2d) were used as recipients (fetal liver stem cells [FLSC], skin and heart) and C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice were used as donors of FLSC, skin and heart. Recipients were simultaneously transplanted with the heart, the skin and with huIL-10 gene-transduced FLSC. Microchimerism was checked using fluorescent flow cytometry, huIL10 production using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and graft survival was evaluated by daily observation. Significant level of huIL10 (up to 900 pg/mL) was detected for more than 2 weeks in the serum of mice that underwent transplantation. Four weeks after the FLSC injection, microchimerism was identified in the recipient lymphoid organs (spleen, thymus, and bone marrow) by the presence of donor cells (H-2b). Finally, in the group of mice treated with huIL-10 gene-transduced FLSC, skin allografts survived for 18.9 +/- 1.8 days compared with 9.5 and 9.6 days in the groups of mice treated with nontransduced FLSC or huIL-10 alone, respectively. The same pattern for heart allograft survival was observed. HuIL-10 transduction of donor hematopoietic stem cells resulted in production of huIL-10, cell engraftment, and chimerism. Although full tolerance was not obtained, specific and highly significant (P < .001) prolongation of the survival of donor heart allografts with (more than 2-fold compared with nontreated groups) was observed. The infiltration of the transplanted heart and its late rejection demonstrate that stem cells transduced with huIL-10 gene induce "prope" tolerance in this model.
