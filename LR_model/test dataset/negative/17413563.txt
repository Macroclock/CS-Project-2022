Clinical comparison between HeartMate VE auto-mode and HeartMate XVE auto-mode with Opti-Fill and the effect of stroke volume on blood chamber and inflow valve peak pressures. We determined the difference between HeartMate (HM) VE auto mode, average filling 76 mL, and HM XVE Opti-Fill, average filling 79 mL, regarding blood chamber and inflow valve peak pressure pulses (BCPP and IVPP). The relation between stroke volume (SV) and peak pressures was investigated by using a circulatory mock loop. At high SVs, 79 to 83 mL, BCPP and IVPP never exceeded 400 mm Hg. For lower SVs, down to 50 mL, the peak pressures increased to 788 mm Hg for BCPP and 416 mm Hg for IVPP. Distribution of SV was measured in 2 VE and 6 XVE patients during rest and activities of daily living (ADL). For clinical comparison, percentages of SV >78 mL were determined. At rest, 2190 (VE) and 5772 (XVE) pump beats were registered and 4511 (VE) and 8713 (XVE) during ADL. Percentages of "SV >78 mL" at rest, respectively, were 42.5 +/- 3.5 and 78.2 +/- 4.7 (p < 0.01) and during ADL, respectively, 48.7 +/- 7.4 and 73.5 +/- 5.3 (p < 0.01). The Opti-Fill software shows a significant increase in percentage SV >78 mL and makes an important contribution to reducing the incidence of high peak pressures in the clinical setting.
