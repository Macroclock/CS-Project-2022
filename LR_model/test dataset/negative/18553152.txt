Advantages of peritoneal dialysis in comparison to hemodialysis, in cardiac allograft recipients with end stage renal disease. End stage renal disease is a serious complication in heart or heart-lung transplant recipients and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The majority of these patients are currently treated with hemodialysis. Since there are no randomized control trials comparing hemodialysis to peritoneal dialysis in this patient population, the potential beneficial effects of peritoneal dialysis remain largely unknown. We compared the clinical outcome of such patients on peritoneal dialysis with another group on hemodialysis. Our results indicate that patients on peritoneal dialysis had fewer episodes of congestive heart failure, fluid overload and a lower overall hospitalization rate, despite having worse cardiac function than patients on hemodialysis.
