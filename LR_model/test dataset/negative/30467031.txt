The Impact of l-Thyroxine Treatment of Donors and Recipients on Postoperative Outcomes After Heart Transplantation. The effect of thyroid dysfunction on adverse outcomes has been studied in many different patient populations. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of thyroid hormone supplementation of donors and recipients on postoperative outcomes after orthotopic heart transplantation. Retrospective. Single center, university hospital. Two-hundred and sixty-six consecutive patients undergoing heart transplantation. No interventions. Demographic, hemodynamic, and clinical characteristics; donor and recipient United Network for Organ Sharing scores; and information on thyroid hormone support of donors and recipients were recorded. During the median follow-up of 4.59 years (interquartile range 4.26-4.92 y), 70 patients (26.3%) died. After adjustments were made for the United Network for Organ Sharing score, recipients who were treated preoperatively with l-thyroxine had a lower risk for all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06-0.98; p = 0.047) compared with recipients who were not treated with l-thyroxine. In addition, l-thyroxine treatment of donors was associated with a better recipient survival (HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11-0.87; p = 0.025). Pretransplantation thyroid hormone supplementation of donors and recipients was associated with improved long-term survival after heart transplantation.
