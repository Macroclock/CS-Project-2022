Management of a young patient with dextrocardia, atrial septal defect, and Eisenmenger syndrome with venous-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and heart-lung transplantation. Dextrocardia is a rare congenital condition which presents important challenges for surgical management. We discuss a patient with dextrocardia, atrial septal defect, and Eisenmenger syndrome, which ultimately led to decompensated end-stage lung disease and heart-lung transplant. Venous-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was an important strategy to bridge the patient until donor organs became available. Transplantation of a heart-lung block allowed for the treatment of the patient's underlying congenital heart defect, anatomic reversal of dextrocardia with appropriate venous and arterial connections, and management of pulmonary damage from pulmonary hypertension.
