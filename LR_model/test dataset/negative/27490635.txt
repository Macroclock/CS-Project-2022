Does asymptomatic recurrent diffuse capillary C4d complement deposition impair cardiac allograft function? The aim of this study was to evaluate whether asymptomatic recurrent (≥2) antibody-mediated rejection (pAMR 1+), defined as diffuse capillary C4d immunostaining (rAMR) on endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs), during the first year after heart transplantation impairs left ventricular (LV) function. Fifty-four consecutive heart transplant patients who survived well (New York Heart Association ≤2 and EF≥55%) the first month after transplantation were enrolled and prospectively underwent 490 echocardiographies and EMB. Asymptomatic rAMR without histopathologic findings was evaluated as a risk factor for deterioration of graft function. Primary endpoint, assessed 1 year after transplantation, was development of LV dysfunction and/or adverse remodeling according to pre-specified echo parameters. During the first year from transplantation, rAMR occurred in five patients. Recurrent AMR was associated with a significant higher risk to develop LV concentric hypertrophy (OR 3.6, 95% CI: 1.8-7.0, P=.02) or reduced lateral S' peak velocity (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.5-3.6, P=.03). Patients with rAMR showed significative adverse graft remodeling (ΔLV end-diastolic volume: +16±12.3 vs -0.2±14.4 mL; P=.02) and deterioration of graft function (Δlateral S' peak velocity: -3.3±3 vs -0.4±2.9 cm/s; P=.03). Recurrent asymptomatic diffuse capillary C4d immunostaining may play a role in the early development of cardiac allograft adverse remodeling and dysfunction.
