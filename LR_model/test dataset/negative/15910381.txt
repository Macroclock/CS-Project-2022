Advances in strategies for inducing central tolerance in organ allograft recipients. Encouraging results in large animal models and from the clinic have been reported recently suggesting that the deliberate induction of transplantation tolerance using central deletional protocols may be closer to becoming a reality. The induction of central tolerance would be especially applicable to pediatric organ transplant recipients. In this review, we discuss three promising protocols of central tolerance induction and why they are relevant to pediatric organ transplantation.
