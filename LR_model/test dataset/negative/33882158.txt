Symptoms of anxiety after heart transplantation and their association with mortality: A secondary analysis. Few studies, with inconclusive results, have examined the association of anxiety with mortality after heart transplantation (HTx). We examined whether anxiety symptoms, measured several years after HTx, are associated with increased mortality during long-term follow-up. Anxiety symptoms were measured with the anxiety subscale of the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R) in 142 HTx recipients at a mean of 5.7 years (SD: 3.9) after HTx. Anxiety symptoms' impact on mortality during follow-up for up to 18.6 years was examined with Cox proportional hazard models. We accounted for relevant sociodemographic and clinical variables, including depressive symptoms (measured by the depression subscale of the SCL-90-R), in the multivariate analyses. In additional analyses, we explored the combined effect of anxious and depressive symptomatology. Anxiety symptoms were not significantly associated with mortality (univariate analysis: HR (95% CI): 1.04 (0.75-1.45); p = .813). Exploration of the combined effect of anxious and depressive symptomatology on mortality rendered non-significant results. Depressive symptoms were independently associated with mortality (multivariate analysis: HR (95% CI): 1.86 (1.07-3.24); p = .028). Depressive symptoms' negative impact on survival after HTx was confirmed, while anxiety symptoms were not significantly associated with mortality during long-term follow-up. Anxiety symptoms' predictive role after HTx requires further study. 'anxiety', 'depression', 'heart transplantation', 'mortality', 'survival analyses'
