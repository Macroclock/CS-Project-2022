Association of Newly Developed Right Bundle Branch Block with Graft Rejection Following Heart Transplantation. We aimed to examine associations between right bundle branch block (RBBB) following heart transplantation (HT) and graft rejection. We investigated 51 patients who underwent endomyocardial biopsies, electrocardiogram, right-side cardiac catheterization, and echocardiography at 1 month and 1 year after HT. We classified patients into four groups according to the development of RBBB, based on electrocardiogram at 1 month and 1 year: 1) sustained RBBB, 2) disappeared RBBB, 3) newly developed RBBB, and 4) sustained non-RBBB. The RBBB was defined as an RSR' pattern in V1 with a QRS duration ≥100 ms on electrocardiogram. The newly developed RBBB group (n=13, 25.5%) had a higher rate of new onset graft rejection (from grade 0 to grade ≥1R, 30.8% vs. 10.0% vs. 21.4%,  Close monitoring for new development of RBBB at 1 year after HT, which was associated with a higher incidence of new onset graft rejection, may be helpful to identify high risk patients for graft rejection.
