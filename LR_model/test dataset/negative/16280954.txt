Dilated cardiomyopathy in a 7-year-old girl. Pediatric patients with dilated cardiomyopathy can initially be present for medical attention with non-specific and misleading signs and symptoms. We present the case of a 7-year-old girl with vague complaints of fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain and cardiac murmur on physical exam who progressed to congestive heart failure before her dilated cardiomyopathy was diagnosed. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for dilated cardiomyopathy in any patient with cardiac murmur and systematic symptoms.
