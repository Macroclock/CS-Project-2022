Low incidence and severity of transplant-associated coronary artery disease in heart transplants from live donors. Hearts transplanted from patients undergoing heart-lung transplantation (domino hearts) are unique because they have not been subjected to the deleterious effects of brain-stem death. This study examines the incidence and severity of transplant-associated coronary artery disease in recipients of domino hearts. We retrospectively reviewed angiographic and clinical data from 97 patients who survived more than 1 year after domino heart transplantation at our hospital. Duration of follow-up ranged from 1 to 11 years after transplantation. The diagnosis of coronary artery disease was based on angiographic criteria. At 1 year, freedom from angiographic coronary artery disease was 99% (70% confidence interval [CI], 97-100), at 5 years it was 83% (70% CI, 78-89), and at 10 years it was 77% (70% CI, 70-84). Donor age, cystic fibrosis in the donor, organ ischemia time during transplantation, and acute rejection after transplantation did not influence risk for the disease. We found an increased incidence of coronary disease in hearts from male donors compared with those from female donors: freedom from disease at 5 years was 72% (70% CI, 63-81) in men vs 93% (87-99) in women. Thirteen patients experienced coronary artery disease at a median of 3 years after transplantation; 4 patients died but most patients remained asymptomatic with angiographically mild disease at their last follow-up examination. We found decreased incidence and severity of transplant-associated coronary artery disease in recipients of domino hearts compared with that reported in recipients of cadaveric hearts. This data supports the continued practice of domino heart transplantation and also supports the hypothesis that brain death may contribute to the development of transplant coronary artery disease in recipients of hearts transplanted from cadaveric organ donors.
