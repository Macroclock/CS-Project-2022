Monster Lung Cavity in a Heart Transplant Recipient. Invasive mucormycosis infections occur in less than 1% of recipients of orthotopic heart transplants. Given the angioinvasive nature of these infections, the mortality rate is high. Little literature exists regarding the presentation and management of these infections. We present a case of a patient who developed an infection after orthotopic heart transplant, describe the successful multidisciplinary management surrounding his care, and review the available literature regarding mucormycosis infections in heart transplant recipients.
