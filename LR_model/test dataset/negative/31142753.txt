A normothermic ex vivo organ perfusion delivery method for cardiac transplantation gene therapy. Clinically, both percutaneous and surgical approaches to deliver viral vectors to the heart either have resulted in therapeutically inadequate levels of transgene expression or have raised safety concerns associated with extra-cardiac delivery. Recent developments in the field of normothermic ex vivo cardiac perfusion storage have now created opportunities to overcome these limitations and safety concerns of cardiac gene therapy. This study examined the feasibility of ex vivo perfusion as an approach to deliver a viral vector to a donor heart during storage and the resulting bio distribution and expression levels of the transgene in the recipient post-transplant. The influence of components (proprietary solution, donor blood, and ex vivo circuitry tubing and oxygenators) of the Organ Care System (OC) (TransMedics, Inc., Andover MA) on viral vector transduction was examined using a cell-based luciferase assay. Our ex vivo perfusion strategy, optimized for efficient Adenoviral vector transduction, was utilized to deliver 5 × 10
