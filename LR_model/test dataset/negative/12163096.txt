Atrial tachycardia with recipient-to-donor atrioatrial conduction and isthmus-dependent donor atrial flutter in a patient after orthotopic heart transplantation. Successful treatment by radiofrequency catheter ablation. Atrial arrhythmias are common after orthotopic heart transplantation. We report an unusual case of a patient after heart transplantation with 2 types of atrial arrhythmias: one was a macro-reentrant, incisional, recipient-atrial tachycardia conducted to the donor atrium, and the other was a common-type, isthmus-dependent atrial flutter in the donor atrium. These 2 arrhythmias were successfully treated with selective radiofrequency catheter ablation.
