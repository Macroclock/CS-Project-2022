Management of infants and young children with combined heart and kidney failure. Most infants and children referred for cardiac transplantation have low cardiac output with concurrent renal hypoperfusion leading to renal insufficiency and failure. This article is a review of the literature of and a single center's experience with combined heart and kidney failure in infants and children less than 10 yr of age. While 39 infants less than 10 yr of age were dialyzed pre- or peri-operatively, none required dialysis support at the time of discharge or in 5-10 yr follow-up. Based on our experience we recommend heart transplant alone in infants and young children with primary heart disease even though they have renal dysfunction.
