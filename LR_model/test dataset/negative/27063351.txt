Adoptive Transfer of Tracer-Alloreactive CD4 T cell receptor transgenic (TCR-Tg) T cells are often used as tracer populations of antigen-specific responses to extrapolate findings to endogenous T cells. The extent to which TCR-Tg T cells behave purely as tracer cells or modify the endogenous immune response is not clear. To test the impact of TCR-Tg T cell transfer on endogenous alloimmunity, recipient mice were seeded with CD4 'T cell biology', 'alloantibody', 'alloantigen', 'animal models: murine', 'basic (laboratory) research/science', 'heart transplantation/cardiology', 'immunobiology', 'rejection: acute'
