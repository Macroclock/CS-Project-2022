Spanish Heart Transplantation Registry. 21st Official Report of the Spanish Society of Cardiology Working Group on Heart Failure and Heart Transplantation (1984-2009). The purpose of this report is to present the results obtained with heart transplantation in Spain from the first use of this therapeutic modality in May 1984. A descriptive analysis of all heart transplantations performed up to December 31, 2009 is presented. In total, 6048 transplants were carried out. The typical clinical profile of a Spanish heart transplant patient in 2009 was that of a 53-year-old male who had been diagnosed with nonrevascularizable ischemic heart disease and who had severely impaired ventricular function and a poor functional status. The implanted heart typically came from a donor who had died from a brain hemorrhage (mean age 37 years) and the average time on the waiting list was 106 days. Mean survival time has increased progressively over the years. Whereas for the whole time series, the probability of survival at 1, 5, 10 and 15 years was 78%, 67%, 53% and 40%, respectively, for the past 5 years, the probability of survival at 1 and 5 years was 85% and 73%, respectively. The most frequent cause of death was acute graft failure (17%), followed by infection (16%), the combination of graft vascular disease and sudden death (14%), tumor (12%) and acute rejection (8%). The survival rates obtained in Spain with heart transplantation, especially in recent years, make the procedure the treatment of choice for patients who have irreversible heart failure and a poor functional status and for whom there are few other established medical or surgical options.
