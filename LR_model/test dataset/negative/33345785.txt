Successful Concomitant Pulmonary Thromboendarterectomy and Heart Transplant. Heart transplantation remains the gold standard of therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure. Submassive pulmonary embolism in a patient with heart failure is generally considered a contraindication to immediate heart transplantation, given the risk of right heart failure posttransplant. Generally patients must wait for extended periods of time to recover from pulmonary embolism therapies before being listed for transplant. We report a case of successful concomitant pulmonary thromboendarterectomy and heart transplantation.
