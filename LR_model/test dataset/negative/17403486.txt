Rectal and cutaneous malakoplakia in an orthotopic cardiac transplant recipient. Malakoplakia, from the Greek term meaning "soft plaque," is a rare granulomatous disease first documented by Michaelis and Gutmann in 1902, and is most commonly found in association with systemic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus, sarcoidosis or neoplasm. We present a case report of malakoplakia in a 55-year-old female patient who had undergone an orthotopic cardiac transplant for ischemic cardiomyopathy. She was found to have an irregular rectal mass, after presenting with a complaint of hematochezia and pressure with defecation as well as a "boil" on her right labia. Malakoplakia is an exceedingly rare disease entity, and this is only the third known report of this condition in a patient after cardiac transplantation. We review the current perspectives on the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of this disease.
