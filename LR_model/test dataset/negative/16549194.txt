Evaluation of the potential role of echocardiography in the detection of allograft rejection in heart transplant recipients. Our objective was to determine the most relevant systolic and diastolic echocardiographic parameters to detect left ventricular (LV) dysfunction associated with allograft rejection among heart transplant recipients. Seven consecutive recipients underwent serial echocardiographic studies with two-dimensional spectral Doppler and tissue Doppler (TD) according to our institutional protocol. Results were compared with clinical status and endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) whenever available. The time since transplantation was 22 to 850 days. Patient no. 2 had a biopsy-proven acute rejection at the 11th week which was associated with decreased TD velocities, ejection fraction (EF), and stroke volume (SV), as well as increased pericardial effusion and posterior wall thickness. Interestingly, changes in TD parameters preceded those in EF and SV. However, similar but less remarkable changes in TD velocities, EF, SV, pericardial effusion, and posterior wall thickness also occurred during other events, such as systemic infection and immediate postoperative hemodynamic compromise despite no rejection. A biopsy performed 7 months later in a patient with a previous rejection episode due to a relatively low EF and SV as well as increasing pericardial effusion with normal TD velocities revealed no rejection. These data suggest that echocardiographic findings, although not specific for acute rejection, may play a potential role as a screening test to exclude rejection in heart transplant recipients.
