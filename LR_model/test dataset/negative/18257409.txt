[Surgical treatment of gastrointestinal complications after the heart transplantation]. Orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) is standard treatment of patients with end-stage heart failure. Long-term immunosuppressive therapy leads to the increased risk of the infection and cancer. Our retrospective study was aimed to evaluate gastrointestinal surgery procedures after OHT. The retrospective study was carried out at the Institute of clinical and experimental medicine (IKEM), between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2006. Our group of patients includes 587 transplant recipients and 22 gastrointestinal surgery procedures. Results from our department did not show statistical differences in the length of hospital stay, morbidity and mortality in comparison with patients after OHT and control group.
