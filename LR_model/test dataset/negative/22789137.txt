Graft survival is better without prior surgery in cardiac transplantation for functionally univentricular hearts. The effect of surgical history on graft outcomes in patients with functionally univentricular hearts (UH) is not well understood. We compared graft outcomes after heart transplantation in children with a UH between patients who received allografts without prior cardiac surgery (Group A) and patients who underwent transplantation after prior cardiac surgery (Group B). We reviewed all patients who received allografts for UH at our institution from 1990 to 2009. Differences in the probability of acute rejection (AR), incidence of graft vasculopathy (GV), and incidence of death or retransplantation were compared between Group A and Group B. Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, the log-rank test, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards modeling were used as appropriate. During the study period, 180 patients with a UH received allografts: 105 in Group A and 75 in Group B at a median (interquartile range) age of 84 (47-120) days vs 584 (168-2,956) days, respectively (p < 0.001). The odds of AR were higher in Group B (odds ratio, 2.7, 95% confidence interval, 1.3-5.4). Group A had lower univariable risks of GV (p = 0.034) and graft loss (p = 0.003). Median graft survival was 18 years in Group A vs 8 years in Group B. The risk of graft loss after 5 years post-transplant was higher in Group B patients who were aged â‰¥ 1 year at time of transplant (p < 0.001). Heart transplantation without prior cardiac surgery in patients with a UH was associated with better graft survival and lower probability of AR. The effect of age is complex and time-dependent, with age affecting outcomes after 5 years.
