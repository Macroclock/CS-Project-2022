CRISPR/Cas 9 system for the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy: A hypothesis related to function of a MAP kinase. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a disease with high incidence and mortality rates. Its therapies have one primary goal, which is to minimize symptoms and it has only one effective approach to healing, the heart transplantation. As it is widely associated with genetic causes, the use of gene therapies, such as the CRISPR/Cas9 system, is a promising alternative to treat DCM. For this purpose, it is necessary to analyze possible target genes for this approach and what would be the implications of their use. Here, we hypothesized that cardiac troponin I type 3 interacting kinase (TNI3K), involved with superoxide production in DCM patients, besides other factors, could be a good target for the use of gene editing.
