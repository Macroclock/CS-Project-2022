Severe obstruction of the left main coronary artery by mycotic aortic psuedoaneurysm following orthotopic heart transplantation. Mycotic aneurysm of the ascending aorta is a rare complication following orthotopic heart transplantation. This article describes a case of mycotic pseudoaneurysm caused by Candida albicans that developed shortly after orthotopic heart transplantation. The pseudoaneurysm compressed the left main coronary artery, which led to the development of congestive heart failure symptoms mimicking sub-acute transplant rejection. The heart failure signs and symptoms resolved completely with resection of the aneurysm. This case reiterates that early diagnosis and complete resection of the aneurysm is associated with good prognosis.
