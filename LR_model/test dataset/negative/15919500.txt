Kaposi sarcoma in solid organ transplant recipients: a single center report. Human herpes virus (HHV8) is associated with Castleman's disease, primary effusion lymphoma, and the Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Among 3815 solid organ transplants performed at our center between 1977 and 2003, five patients (0.1%) were identified with KS. There were one cardiac, one liver, and three renal allograft recipients of median age of 52 (range 38 to 60) years, three of whom were females. Three patients were of Italian and one of Turkish descent; only one patient was a native Austrian. The onset of the disease was 2.0, 7.5, 7.8, 9.4 months, and 22 years posttransplant. Diagnosis of KS was based in all cases on histology. The heart recipient developed a tumor on the planta pedis; one renal recipient, on both legs. The liver and the two remaining renal recipients presented with disseminated disease. Treatment in all cases consisted of reduction in immunosuppression, together with surgery (n = 1), chemotherapy (n = 1), or irradiation (n = 2). Furthermore, immunosuppression was switched in two cases from Tacrolimus to Sirolimus. In the liver recipient a complete response was achieved; he died, however, due to noncompliance followed by graft failure. One renal recipient died without evidence of recurrent disease from myocardial infarction. The cardiac and two renal recipients are alive between 4 months and 17 years with well-functioning grafts and no evidence of recurrent disease. HHV8-associated lesions seem to be extremely rare in the Central European transplant population. Nevertheless, awareness of KS is important for early diagnosis and optimal treatment.
