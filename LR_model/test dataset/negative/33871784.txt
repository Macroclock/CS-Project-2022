Left-ventricular hypertrophy in 18-month-old donor rat hearts was not associated with graft dysfunction in the early phase of reperfusion after cardiac transplantation-gene expression profiling. The use of hearts with left-ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH) could offer an opportunity to extend the donor pool for cardiac transplantation. We assessed the effects of LVH in 18-month-old spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone (SHRSP) donor rats and following transplantation. In donors, cardiac function and structural alterations were assessed. Then, the hearts were transplanted into young normotensive-rats. We evaluated LV graft function 1 h after transplantation. The myocardial expression of 92 genes involved in apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative-stress was profiled using PCR-array. Compared to controls, SHRSP-rats developed LVH, had increased LV systolic performance (slope of the end-diastolic pressure-volume (PV) relationship: 1.6±0.2 vs 0.8±0.1mmHg/μl, p<0.05) accompanied by diastolic dysfunction [prolonged time constant of LV pressure decay (Tau: 15.8±0.6 vs 12.3±0.5ms) and augmented diastolic stiffness (LV end-diastolic PV relationship: 0.103±0.012 vs 0.045±0.006mmHg/ml), p<0.05]. They presented ECG changes, myocardial fibrosis, and increased nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity and plasma troponin-T and creatine kinase-CM levels. After transplantation, even though the graft contractility was better in SHRSP rats compared to controls, the adverse impact of ischemia/reperfusion-injury on contractility was not altered (E 'Ageing;', 'Gene expression', 'Heart transplantation;', 'Left-ventricular hypertrophy;', 'Spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats;'
