Successful heart-kidney transplantation from a Hepatitis C viremic donor to negative recipient: One year of follow-up. Every year the number of patients waiting for a heart transplant increases faster than the number of available donor organs. Some potential donor organs are from donors with active communicable diseases, including hepatitis C virus (HCV), potentially making donation prohibitive. The advent of direct-acting antiviral agents for HCV has drastically changed the treatment of HCV. Recently, these agents have been used to treat HCV in organ donor recipients who acquired the disease from the donor organ. We report a case of heart-kidney transplantation from an HCV viremic donor to HCV negative recipient with successful treatment and sustained virologic response.
