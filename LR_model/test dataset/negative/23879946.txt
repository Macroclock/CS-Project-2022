[Risk factors for hypertension and impact of postoperative hypertension on medium survival after heart transplantation]. To access the prevalence and risk factors for hypertension after heart transplantation (HT), and the impact of post-transplant hypertension on medium-term survival among HT patients. Data from 265 consecutive patients underwent HT between June 2004 and May 2012 in Fuwai hospital and survived for at least 6 months were retrospectively analyzed. Hypertension was defined as systolic pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa) and/or diastolic pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg or current treatment with antihypertensive drugs. Patients were divided into post-HT hypertension group and non-hypertension group. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine preoperative and postoperative risk factors for hypertension after HT. Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test were used for survival analysis. Hypertension was present in 17.4% (46/265) patients before HT and in 57.4% (152/265) patients post HT. The median follow-up time was 37 months (20 - 57 months). Logistic regression analysis showed that male gender (OR: 2.27, 95%CI: 1.16 - 4.42, P < 0.05), history of pre-HT hypertension (OR: 2.22, 95%CI: 1.05 - 4.71, P < 0.05), and cyclosporine A based immunosuppressive therapy (OR: 2.54, 95%CI: 1.51 - 4.29, P < 0.01) were independent risk factors for the development of post-HT hypertension. At the end of 1, 3, 5 years, the survival rate of heart transplant patients by Kaplan-Meier method estimation were 100%, 97.2%, 86.7% in post-HT hypertension group; 98.1%, 93.8%, 93.8% in non-hypertension group. Log rank test displayed that there was no significant difference between the two survival curves (P > 0.05). Hypertension is a frequent comorbidity after HT. Male gender, pre-HT hypertension together with cyclosporine A based immunosuppressive therapy are independent predictors for the development of post-HT hypertension. By adjusting the controllable risk factors and active control of blood pressure, the medium-term survival is similar between patients with or without postoperative hypertension in this cohort.
