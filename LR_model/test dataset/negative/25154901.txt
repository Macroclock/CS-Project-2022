Subnormothermic preservation in somah: a novel approach for enhanced functional resuscitation of donor hearts for transplant. Organ preservation at 4°C results in temporally irreversible injury to cellular structure and function. This study was designed to evaluate the possibility of storing hearts at ambient temperatures in novel organ preservation solution Somah to prevent damage and preserve optimum function by maintaining cellular energy over the temperature range of storage. Porcine hearts were stored in Celsior at 4°C and Somah at 4°C, 13°C and 21°C for 5 h thereafter reperfused and reanimated in vitro for 3 h. Heart weights, histopathology, ultrastructure and 2-dimensional echocardiography (2D-Echo) assessments showed preservation of structure in Somah groups. Tissue high-energy phosphate levels in Somah groups after storage were significantly greater than the Celsior hearts (p < 0.05) and highest in the 21°C Somah hearts. Upon reperfusion, myocardial O2 consumption and lactate levels quickly achieved steady state in 21°C hearts, but were delayed in Somah 4/13°C groups and severely depressed in the Celsior group. Inotrope and electroconversion requirements were inversely related to storage temperature. In vitro 2D Echo demonstrated a discordantly attenuated function in the Celsior group, moderate functionality in 4°C Somah group and superior reestablishment of performance in the Somah higher temperature groups. Hearts stored in Somah at 21°C were metabolically and functionally superior to any other groups.
