Attitudes to Cardiac Xenotransplantation by Pediatric Heart Surgeons and Physicians. Cardiac transplantation in early childhood is limited by scarcity of organ donors. Advances in cardiac xenotransplantation (XTx) research suggest that xenografts may one day represent an alternative to allografts. We sought to determine the attitudes among surgeons and cardiologists in the field of pediatric cardiac transplantation toward the potential use of XTx if this clinical option were to become a reality. A Likert-scale anonymous survey addressing the use of XTx in pediatric patients was sent to members of the Congenital Heart Surgeons (CHS) Society and the Pediatric Heart Transplant Society. Results were described and compared between the two surgeon/physician groups. Ninety-two CHS and 42 pediatric transplant cardiologists (PTC) responded (N = 134). The potential acceptance of XTx was high in both groups, assuming risks and results were similar to those of cardiac allotransplantation (88% CHS vs 81% PTC;  Our findings suggest that potential acceptance of XTx by CHS and PTC would not be a major barrier if XTx demonstrated similar outcomes to allotransplantation. Acceptance by other congenital heart stakeholders remains to be investigated. 'attitudes', 'congenital heart disease', 'physicians', 'surgeons', 'xenotransplantation'
