Heart transplantation in pediatric population and in adults with congenital heart disease: long-term follow-up, critical clinical analysis, and perspective for the future. Heart transplantation is a treatment option for children as well as for adults with congenital heart disease. To report the experience of a tertiary center with heart transplant program in pediatric population and in adults with congenital heart disease. The study consisted of the evaluation of pediatric as well as adult patients undergoing heart transplantation for congenital heart disease. We evaluated the following indication and complications such as renal dialysis, graft vascular disease, tumors and survival. From October 1992 to November 2013, 134 patients had transplantation, and there were 139 transplantations and 5 retransplantations. The immunosuppression regimen is based on calcineurin inhibitors and cytostatic drugs. The type of heart disease indicated for transplantation was cardiomyopathies in 70% and congenital heart disease in 30%. Of these 134 patients, 85 patients were alive. Actuarial survival is 77.4%, 69.6%, 59.3% at 1, 5, and 10 years after transplantation. Three patients underwent renal transplantation, 1 patient is in renal dialysis, and 8.2% of patients had post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. Two patients had retransplantation for graft vascular disease; 1 of them required a simultaneous kidney transplant and died 30 days after the procedure and 1 patient is clinically well 2 years after retransplantation. Heart transplantation in children and in adults with congenital heart disease is a promising therapeutic option and enables long-term survival for these patients.
