Comparison of 10-year graft failure rates after induction with basiliximab or anti-thymocyte globulin in pediatric heart transplant recipients-The influence of race. The impact of induction therapy in pediatric heart transplantation has been uncertain. Given the risk of poor outcomes in black pediatric heart transplant recipients, we evaluated the effect on graft survival of ATG and BAS induction in black and non-black pediatric recipients. This was a retrospective analysis of pediatric candidates (aged ≤18 years) who underwent heart transplantation from 2000 to 2016 identified from the UNOS database. Primary outcome was 10-year graft survival. This study included 654 patients receiving BAS, 2385 patients receiving ATG, and 2425 receiving no induction. Ten-year survival was similar for the following groups: non-black BAS (57%), non-black ATG (66%), and black ATG (51%). The black BAS group had a 10-year graft survival of 39% which was inferior on pairwise comparison to the other groups (all P values < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, ATG was associated with decreased risk of graft failure when compared to no induction (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76-0.97, P = 0.011) and had an association approaching statistical significance when compared to BAS induction (0.84, 0.7-1.01, P = 0.069). This association was seen in black recipients in whom ATG was strongly associated with decreased risk of graft failure when compared to either no induction (0.65, 0.5-0.83, P = 0.001) or BAS (0.64, 0.46-0.89, P = 0.008) but was not seen in non-black recipients. Black pediatric heart transplant recipients who received ATG induction had an improved long-term graft survival compared to those who received BAS induction or no induction.
