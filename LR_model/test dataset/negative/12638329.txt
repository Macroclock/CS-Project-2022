[Use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy in cardiology. State of the art]. Magnetic resonance imaging of tissues and organs, specifically the use of magnetic resonance specroscopy (MRS) for examination of metabolism in vivo, is a relatively new modality with a very dynamic development and a promising future. In the past few years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used more widely in cardiology. A certain stereotype has been broken that this modality is dedicated strictly for neuroradiology. The technological advances in MRI include introduction of new systems with short acquisition times and software for imaging of the heart and large vessels (cardiac package). Potent and fast gradients in new MR systems make it possible to use cardiac MRS in clinical practice. The introduction of in vitro spectroscopy is an important step in the identification of the metabolic components of the myocardium, just as the in vivo spectroscopy was important in neuroradiology. This method has been used over many years for basic science, and only now is it being used widely in clinical practice. In the examination of heart metabolism two types of MRS are frequently used: phosphate (31PMRS) and proton (1HMRS). The phosphate spectroscopy examines the composition and metabolism of high energy compounds, intracellular pH and indirectly provides information about glucose metabolism. Proton spectro-scopy determines lipid (Lip), lactate (Lac) and high-energy compounds--creatine (Cr) levels. Heart MRS examinations are performed in many clinical centers around the world. In this review about MRS, the authors will attempt to present the opportunities for practical application of this method in cardiology based on the experience of renowned medical centers and first experience of the authors themselves.
