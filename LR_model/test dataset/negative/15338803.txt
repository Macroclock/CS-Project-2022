Role of siroliumus, a novel immunosuppressive drug in heart and lung transplantation. Lung and heart transplantation has become an accepted therapeutic option for patients with end-stage disease. However, the calcineurin-inhibitor-based immunosuppression often causes renal impairment. Therefore, sirolimus, a novel immunosuppressive agent, may serve as an alternative or complementary agent to calcineurin inhibitors. The aim of this review was to summarize the role of sirolimus in lung and heart transplantation. Although only a few, small studies have been conducted so far, the drug's mechanisms of action and low-toxicity profile make it a highly promising option.
