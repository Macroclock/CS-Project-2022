A numerical hemodynamic tool for predictive vascular surgery. We suggest a new approach to peripheral vascular bypass surgery planning based on solving the one-dimensional (1D) governing equations of blood flow in patient-specific models. The aim of the present paper is twofold. First, we present the coupled 1D-0D model based on a discontinuous Galerkin method in a comprehensive manner, such as it becomes accessible to a wider community than the one of mathematicians and engineers. Then we show how this model can be applied to predict hemodynamic parameters and help therefore clinicians to choose for the best surgical option bettering the hemodynamics of a bypass. After presenting some benchmark problems, we apply our model to a real-life clinical application, i.e. a femoro-popliteal bypass surgery. Our model shows good agreement with preoperative and intraoperative measurements of velocity and pressure and post-surgical reports.
