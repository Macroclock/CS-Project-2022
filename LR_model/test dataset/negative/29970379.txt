Impact of Ventricular Morphology on Fiber Stress and Strain in Fontan Patients. Right ventricular (RV) morphology has been associated with adverse clinical outcomes in Fontan patients. The impact of RV versus left ventricular morphology on ventricular stress and strain in single ventricles is not well known. Cardiac magnetic resonance examinations in 193 patients with the Fontan circulation were retrospectively analyzed. Ventricular mass, volume, global circumferential and longitudinal strain, and global average end-systolic fiber stress were calculated using previously published methods. Compared with left ventricular morphology, RV morphology (48%) was associated with higher ventricular end-diastolic volume (110 mL/BSA In comparison to Fontan patients with a dominant left ventricle, those with a dominant RV have higher fiber stress, a higher rate of ventricular dilatation, lower circumferential fiber shortening, and similar longitudinal shortening. RV morphology, ventricular dilation, and worse circumferential strain are associated with death or heart transplantation. The difference in myofiber architecture may contribute to suboptimal adaptation of the RV as a systemic ventricle. 'blood pressure', 'dilatation', 'heart transplantation', 'prevalence'
