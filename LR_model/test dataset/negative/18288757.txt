Drug-eluting stenting of unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis in patients with orthotopic heart transplantation: Initial clinical experience. To assess the safety and efficacy of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES) in orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) patients with unprotected left main coronary artery (ULMCA) disease. Accelerated transplant coronary artery disease occurs in 50% of patients at 5 years and is the major cause of death following OHT. The optimal treatment for ULMCA disease in OHT patients is unknown. From April 2003 to December 2006, five OHT patients with ULMCA disease underwent PCI with DES at the University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center. Technical success was achieved in all five patients. At a median follow-up of 518 days (range 124-990 days), all five patients were alive and free from death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization. No binary restenosis was present in four patients who underwent surveillance angiography. One patient underwent repeat OHT for progressive left ventricular dysfunction. In OHT patients, ULMCA PCI with DES is feasible with an excellent technical success rate and is a reasonably palliative treatment option for this difficult patient population.
