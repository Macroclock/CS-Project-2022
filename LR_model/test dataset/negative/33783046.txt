Successful heart transplantation after 17 h ex vivo time using the Organ Care System-3 years follow-up. Cold storage preservation is the standard approach for heart transplantation but is a time-limited method of care. Ex vivo heart perfusion expands the donor pool due by mitigating time and distance barriers and allows the possibility to improve graft function. We report long term follow up of a successful heart transplantation following an ex vivo time of 17 h using the Organ Care System in a patient with a left ventricular assist device.
