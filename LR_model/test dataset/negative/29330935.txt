Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in a young adult with transplanted heart: what happened to denervation? This manuscript describes the first report of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in a young heart transplant recipient following angry debate. Our patient is a 21-year-old woman with cardiac transplant performed owing to right ventricular failure in congenital heart disease. Positive echocardiography with typical asymmetry of regional function, positive enzymes, and negative biopsy and angiography met the criteria for the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Patient was discharged after 1Â week in good clinical conditions and fully recovered cardiac function. The development of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in transplanted heart suggests that re-innervation occurs, thus representing a target for catecholamine-induced cardiac dysfunction.
