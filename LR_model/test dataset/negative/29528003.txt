Experience With Cardiac Implantable Electrical Device Explantation After Cardiac Transplantation: A Report of 16 Cases From a Single Center in a Period of 5 Years. Cardiac implantable electrical devices are widely used for patients with advanced heart failure and are usually explanted during orthotopic heart transplant. However, lead fragments and the pulse generator are sometimes left after the procedure. Given the concerns of infectious and thromboembolic complications, their removal is recommended. Herein, we report our experience with cardiac implantable electrical device explantation after orthotopic heart transplant. We included recipients of heart transplants performed at Ba≈ükent University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, who underwent lead and pulse generator explantation by manual traction between January 2012 and June 2017. We analyzed patient demographic, clinical, biochemical, and treatment properties. Sixteen patients (11 males, 5 females) with a median age of 45 years (range, 18-52 y) were included. Two patients (12.5%) died during follow-up but not secondary to device explantation. All patients were using immunosuppressives and 50% were receiving antiplatelet/anticoagulant agents. All pulse generators were located at the left prepectoral area, with tips of lead fragments in the superior vena cava or left subclavian vein. No procedural complications were observed. Aspirin was continued uninterrupted perioperatively, warfarin was stopped 2 days before the procedure, and low-molecular-weight heparins were skipped on the morning and evening of the procedure. One patient (6.3%) complained of postoperative pain, and another (6.3%) developed a pocket hematoma, which was treated conservatively. No patient developed fever, clinical infection, or major bleeding. Preoperative and postoperative levels of hemoglobin, white blood cells, and C-reactive protein were similar. No demographic, procedural, or biochemical variable was significantly correlated with postprocedural complications. In our cohort, explantation of lead fragments and pulse generators of cardiac implantable electrical devices was safe after heart transplant. It appears that neither antiplatelet/anticoagulant agents nor immunosuppressives seem to put patients at increased risk of postoperative complications.
