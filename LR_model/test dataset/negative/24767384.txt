The status of heart transplantation in Taiwan, 2005-2010. Heart transplantation (HT) is the standard therapy used to treat end-stage heart disease. Taiwan Organ Registry and Sharing Center (TORSC) is a registry and database of organ donations and transplantations. To understand the profiles of heart donors and recipients is crucial for efficient utilization. Data was provided by the TORSC and 487 HT were performed from 2005 to 2010. The main causes of donor brain death were head injury (n = 243; 51.1%) and cerebrovascular accidents/strokes (n = 147; 30.9%). The mean age of the recipients was 46.3 ± 14.6 years, and 80.3% were men (n = 391). Physicians and nurses were responsible for most organ procurement. In multivariate analysis, considering donor and recipient gender, donor and recipient age, and donor-to-recipient weight ratio as independent variables, factors that were significantly predictive of graft survival were donor age (hazard rate [HR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.03; P = .01) and recipient age (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; P < .01). Our results showed that age is a determinant of allograft survival and healthcare professionals are the primary impetus for obtaining consent for organ donation.
