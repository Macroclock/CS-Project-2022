[Indications and strategies in mechanical circulatory support : Rise of the machines?] Terminal heart failure is an emerging problem with a continuously growing number of diseased patients worldwide. Because of the limited number of donor hearts, mechanical circulatory support is increasingly becoming an integral part of surgical treatment for end-stage heart failure, especially in patients deemed for destination therapy. Accurate patient selection, appropriate indication, and the optimal implantation time point guarantee a good outcome for these patients. This review article gives a systematic overview of the possible indication settings and treatment strategies for various patient groups in need of mechanical circulatory support.
