The Influence of Sex Differences on Cardiopulmonary Exercise Metrics Following Heart Transplant. Previous work has shown sex-related differences in cardiopulmonary responses in patients with heart failure (HF); however, sex differences following heart transplant (HTx) have not been examined. Thus, we hypothesized women would demonstrate lower peak oxygen uptake (VO HTx patients with cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) between 2007 and 2016 were included. Pre-HTx CPET occurred within 24 months pre-HTx with post-HTx CPET within 12 months following HTx. VO Eighty-eight patients (Men [M]: n = 63, age: 55 ± 12 years; Women [W]: n = 25, age: 47 ± 11 years) were assessed. Pre-HTx VO These data demonstrate that cardiopulmonary improvements following HTx patients occur for both sexes. Importantly, women show similar significant functional improvements following HTx compared with men.
