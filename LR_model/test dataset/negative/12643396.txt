Intracoronary E-/L-selectin blockade reduces neutrophil infiltration in heart transplantation. This study examined the effect of local intracoronary delivery of a unique monoclonal antibody (mAb) to both E- and L-selectin (EL-246) on neutrophil infiltration after global ischemia during cardiac transplantation. In 12 ovine heart transplants, allograft coronary arteries were locally perfused with EL-246 (n = 6), or isotype-matched control antibodies (n = 2) or saline (n = 4). At 24 hours posttransplant, myocardium was analyzed for neutrophil infiltration and myocardial water content. The mean number of intramyocardial neutrophils per area (PMN/hpf) was greatly reduced in the allografts perfused with EL-246 (3.45 +/- 0.4 PMN/hpf), compared with an average 6.5 +/- 0.97 PMN/hpf in control hearts (p = 0.004). Peripheral leukocyte counts were unaffected; myocardial water content was not significantly reduced. Local perfusion of cardiac allografts with blocking antibody EL-246 before reperfusion significantly reduced the neutrophilic infiltration that occurs early after transplantation. Prohibiting neutrophil-endothelial adhesion and transmigration may be useful in decreasing neutrophil-dependent post-reperfusion injury in transplantation and routine cardiac surgery.
