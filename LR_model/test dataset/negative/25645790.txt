Effect of early conversion to everolimus together with prophylaxis with valganciclovir in the prevention of cytomegalovirus infection in heart transplant recipients. Viral infections, especially cytomegalovirus (CMV), are a leading cause of early death and morbidity after heart transplantation. Several strategies have been used to minimize the risk, including universal prophylaxis with ganciclovir or valganciclovir and preemptive therapy. Lately, everolimus (EVE) efficacy studies have shown a protective effect against CMV infection. We studied retrospectively a series of 223 heart transplant patients, dividing them into 5 groups according to CMV prevention strategy: 16 patients were at low risk for infection (negative recipient [R-]/negative donor [D-]) and received no treatment; 26 patients received prophylactic therapy with ganciclovir, 8 patients prophylaxis with valganciclovir, 145 patients received preemptive therapy and 28 patients prophylaxis with valganciclovir and early conversion to EVE. There were no cases of CMV infection in the low-risk group. There was 1 case of CMV infection in the group that received valganciclovir and conversion to EVE. Among the patients who received prophylaxis with ganciclovir or valganciclovir or preemptive therapy, CMV infection was detected in 68 patients (37%). Early conversion to EVE in addition to valganciclovir prophylaxis was superior to other strategies in our series for the prevention of CMV infection.
