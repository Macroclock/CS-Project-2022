Novel catheter-interventional strategy for intracardiac connecting of total anomalous pulmonary venous return in newborns with hypoplastic left heart-syndrome prior to hybrid approach. Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR) associated with hypoplastic left heart-syndrome (HLHS) is a rare condition, and from the therapeutical point of view associated with a high Aristotle score and thus increased mortality. We report two newborns with HLHS, one with a supracardiac type of TAPVR and mildly obstructed left vertical vein, and the other with a supracardiac type of TAPVR in association with cor triatriatum and severely obstructed left-sided vertical vein. In both patients, radio frequency perforation from the pulmonary venous confluence to the systemic venous atrium was performed with consecutive gradual balloon dilatation, followed by stent placement in one. Hybrid stage I, and comprehensive stage II were successfully performed thereafter. Currently, both are awaiting their Fontan completion. Transcatheter intracardiac connecting of supracardiac type of TAPVR in newborns with HLHS is feasible and might render these children suitable candidates for further hybrid approach.
