Cognitive function after heart transplantation: Comparing everolimus-based and calcineurin inhibitor-based regimens. Studies have shown conflicting results concerning the occurrence of cognitive impairment after successful heart transplantation (HTx). Another unresolved issue is the possible differential impact of immunosuppressants on cognitive function. In this study, we describe cognitive function in a cohort of HTx recipients and subsequently compare cognitive function between subjects on either everolimus- or calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based immunosuppression. Cognitive function, covering attention, processing speed, executive functions, memory, and language functions, was assessed with a neuropsychological test battery. Thirty-seven subjects were included (everolimus group: n=20; CNI group: n=17). The extent of cerebrovascular pathology was assessed with magnetic resonance imaging. About 40% of subjects had cognitive impairment, defined as performance at least 1.5 standard deviations below normative mean in one or several cognitive domains. Cerebrovascular pathology was present in 33.3%. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups across cognitive domains. Given the high prevalence of cognitive impairment in the sample, plus the known negative impact of cognitive impairment on clinical outcome, our results indicate that cognitive assessment should be an integrated part of routine clinical follow-up after HTx. However, everolimus- and CNI-based immunosuppressive regimens did not show differential impacts on cognitive function.
