Sex differences in continuous-flow ventricular assist device therapy for advanced heart failure. The effect of patient sex in continuous-flow ventricular assist device (c-VAD) therapy has not been well described. We investigated sex-specific differences in clinical outcomes related to c-VAD therapy for Japanese patients. We retrospectively analyzed 153 patients, including 41 (27%) female patients who underwent c-VAD implantation over the last 13 years in our institution for a mean follow-up of 766 ± 446 days. Clinical outcomes were compared between male and female patients RESULTS: There was no significant difference in mortality, cerebral vascular accidents, the severity of heart failure, or driveline infection in patients who underwent c-VAD implantation, regardless of sex. While male patients tended to have more bleeding at the time of surgery, female patients had significantly higher rates of non-surgical bleeding during subsequent c-VAD therapy, mainly from gynecological origins. Female patients treated with c-VAD had a significantly higher incidence of non-surgical bleeding events. Careful attention to gynecological complications and sex-specific care is required in female patients with c-VAD.
