T cells in cardiac allograft vasculopathy are skewed to memory Th-1 cells in the presence of a distinct Th-2 population. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) in heart transplantation (HTx) patients remains the major complication for long-term survival, due to concentric neointima hyperplasia induced by infiltrating mononuclear cells (MNC). Previously, we showed that activated memory T-helper-1 (Th-1) cells are the major component of infiltrating MNC in coronary arteries with CAV. In this study, a more detailed characterization of the MNC in human coronary arteries with CAV (n = 5) was performed and compared to coronary arteries without CAV (n = 5), by investigating MNC markers (CD1a, DRC-1, CD3, CD20, CD27, CD28, CD56, CD68, CD69, FOXP3 and HLA-DR), cytokines (IL-1A, 2, 4, 10, 12B, IFN-gamma, and TGF-beta1), and chemokine receptors (CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR7, CCR8, CXCR3 and CX3CR1) by immunohistochemical double-labeling and quantitative PCR on mRNA isolated from laser microdissected layers of coronary arteries. T cells in the neointima and adventitia of CAV were skewed toward an activated memory Th-1 phenotype, but in the presence of a distinct Th-2 population. FOXP3 positive T cells were not detected and production of most cytokines was low or absent, except for IFN-gamma, and TGF-beta. This typical composition of T-helper cells and especially production of IFN-gamma and TGF-beta may play an important role in the proliferative CAV reaction.
