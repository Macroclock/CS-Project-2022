Effects of different serotonin receptor subtype antagonists on the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy in murine aortic allografts. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the main obstacle for long-term survival after heart transplantation. Alloimmune mediated chronic vascular rejection results in several mechanisms like platelet activation, immigration of inflammatory cells through the endothelial layer and proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Serotonin (5-HT) promotes these processes via activation of 5-HT CBA/JRj mice recieved aortic grafts from C57BL/6 mice. After transplantation until recovery of organs, recipients were treated with serotonin receptor antagonists: sarpogrelate (5-HT Elevated serum serotonin levels were significantly reduced after 5-HT Inhibition of the 5HT/5-HT 'Cardiac allograft vasculopathy', 'Murine aortic transplantation', 'Sarpogrelate', 'Serotonin receptor antagonists'
