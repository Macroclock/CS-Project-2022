Heart Transplant in Patient With Isolated Left Superior Vena Cava by Atrial Appendage Rotation. Orthotopic heart transplantation in patients with an isolated persistent left superior vena cava is extremely rare, and the anastomotic connection between a right-sided donor superior vena cava and left-sided recipient superior vena cava can be challenging to perform. We present a novel technique used in an infant female, using the left atrial appendage to extend the superior vena cava anastomosis.
