The H1N1 influenza pneumonia as early complication after heart transplantation--experience from the Dubrava University Hospital, Zagreb, Croatia. In April 2009, a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus was initially detected, and only after two months World Health Organization declared pandemic, while virus became globally present. We report here a confirmed case of patient suffering from H1N1 influenza pneumonia in an early period after heart transplantation. Complications of influenza A and B include viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia and possibly acute allograft rejection in the setting of weaning of immunosuppression. In our case H1N1 influenza pneumonia was treated according to the published guidelines and had a mild course of disease, but nevertheless emphasis should be put on the prevention of disease applying known general infection control procedures and vaccination while disease course cannot be predicted.
