Electromechanical synchronization of the heterotopic and native heart by dual atrial stimulation following heart transplantation. After heterotopic heart transplantation, a 59-year-old woman presented with remarkable symptoms of breathlessness and fatigue, despite excellent donor heart function. Asynchrony of donor and native heart provoked haemodynamic instability. Dual atrial pacemaker implantation lead to linkage and synchronization of atrial and ventricular contraction in both the donor and native heart with the faster organ executing the synchronization. Remarkable relief of symptoms has been evident during the long-term follow-up.
