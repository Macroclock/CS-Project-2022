Consistent improvements in short- and long-term survival following heart transplantation over the past three decades. Despite noted improvements in short-term survival outcomes following orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT), review of the relevant literature suggests little improvement in long-term outcomes for patients surviving beyond 1 year. All OHT cases performed between 1989 and 2019 within the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database were reviewed. Adults who underwent isolated OHT were included in a 1-year survival analysis. Those who survived at least 1 year post-transplant were included in a long-term survival analysis. Demographic factors were assessed using Students' t test and chi-square analysis. Survival trends and risk factors were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier and the Cox regression analysis, respectively. A total of 53 265 and 46 372 recipients were included in the short-term and long-term cohorts, respectively. In an adjusted analysis, the reference implant era 2014-2019 had significantly better short-term survival outcomes when compared with earlier implant eras: 1989-1993 (HR: 2.92), 1994-1998 (HR: 1.53), 1999-2003 (HR: 1.27), 2004-2008 (HR: 1.11), and 2009-2013 (HR: 1.02). The same trend was recognized for long-term outcomes: 1989-1993 (HR: 1.87), 1994-1998 (HR: 1.27), 1999-2003 (HR: 1.09), and 2004-2008 (HR: 1.03). Despite increases in multiple traditional risk factors, both short-term and long-term survival outcomes have consistently improved over the past 30 years, suggesting other factors are contributing to improved outcomes in recent eras.
