Total Artificial Heart Update. The SynCardia Total Artificial Heart (TAH, SynCardia Systems, Tucson, AZ) is the only biventricular cardiac replacement approved for bridge to transplantation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and which carries the European Union CE mark. It has been implanted in about 2000 patients. In experienced centers, 60 to 80 % of implanted patients have been transplanted and over 80 % of those transplanted have lived for over 1 year. The SynCardia TAH has supported potential cardiac recipients with irreversible biventricular failure for up to 6 years, providing physiologic pulsatile flows of 6 to 8 L/min at filling pressures of less than 10 mmHg allowing for optimal perfusion and recovery of organs such as the kidneys and liver. It is a tested device that provides a method for recovering potential transplant candidates who rapidly decompensate from biventricular failure or who have chronic cardiac failure from a variety of etiologies. This article covers the history, mechanical function and monitoring, implantation, patient selection and management, and outpatient use. It also reviews outcome data from the original FDA study as well as contemporary data from experienced centers.
