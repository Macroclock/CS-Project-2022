Heart transplantation and chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a successful case at 2 years of follow-up. In June 2000, we successfully performed an orthotopic cardiac transplant in a 52-year-old man who, together with a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Binet Stage A, Rai Stage 1), also had end-stage dilated idiopathic myocardiopathy. We describe his case and the 2 years of cancer-free follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a heart transplant in this setting.
