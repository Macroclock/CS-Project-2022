Echocardiographic evaluation of the evolutionary changes after heart transplantation. To undertake an evolutionary analysis of echocardiographic examinations carried out during follow-up of cardiac transplant patients. The study included 193 consecutive patients transplanted between August 1998 and December 2004. We excluded pediatric, cardiopulmonary, and repeat transplants. Four echocardiographic examinations were analyzed per patient (first, second, third quarter and the last study carried out; average time from transplant: 1115 +/- 681 days). The total number of examinations was 772. The evaluated variables were thickness of walls and diameters of the cavities, systolic and diastolic functions, pericardial effusion, and number of rejections. The isovolumetric relaxation time showed reduced values during early echocardiography with subsequent increases during evolution (first echocardiogram: 92 +/- 16 vs final echocardiogram 101 +/- 16 ms; P < .0001). Right ventricular function showed initial deterioration with subsequent recovery (first echocardiogram: 16% vs final echocardiogram: 8%; P < .05); moreover, the existence of delayed malfunction of the right ventricle was correlated with a higher incidence of transplant rejection (P < .01). Pericardial effusion was initially present with a tendency to reduce over time (first echocardiogram: 58% vs final echocardiogram: 12%; P < .0001). There was no difference in the other variables. Cardiac transplant patients undergo evolutionary echocardiogram alterations that were mainly early and normalized as of the first quarter. The most usual changes in this period were restrictive isovolumetric behavior accompanied by some degree of depressed right ventricular function. Right ventricular malfunction during late evolution was correlated with a higher incidence of transplant rejection during follow-up.
