Hepatitis C Virus NAT-Positive Solid Organ Allografts Transplanted Into Hepatitis C Virus-Negative Recipients: A Real-World Experience. Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-viremic organs are underutilized, and there is limited real-world experience on the transplantation of HCV-viremic solid organs into recipients who are HCV negative. Patients listed or being evaluated for solid organ transplant after January 26, 2018, were educated and consented by protocol on the transplantation of HCV-viremic organs. All recipients were HCV nucleic acid test and anti-HCV antibody negative at the time of transplant and received an HCV-viremic organ. The primary outcome was sustained virological response (SVR) at 12 weeks after completion of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy (SVR Limited data exist on the transplantation of HCV-viremic organs into recipients who are HCV negative. Our study is the largest to describe a real-world experience of the transplantation of HCV-viremic organs into recipients who are aviremic. In carefully selected patients, the use of HCV-viremic grafts in the DAA era appears to be efficacious and well tolerated.
