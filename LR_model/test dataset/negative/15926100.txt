Heart transplantation and consecutive mitral valve replacement. A 48-year-old man was diagnosed with progressive mitral insufficiency due to fibrosis of papillary muscles and chordae tendineae, necessitating mitral valve replacement (MVR) 8 months after cardiac transplantation. Donor echocardiography and inspection of the heart at procurement were inconspicuous. The patient is alive, free from valve-related complications and functionally improved six years after MVR. The limited yet successful experiences with left-sided valve repair or replacement in the transplanted heart are reviewed.
