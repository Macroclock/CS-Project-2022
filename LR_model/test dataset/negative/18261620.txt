Massive ascites due to right heart failure after cardiac transplantation and its treatment: a case report. Ascites is a common clinical condition during right heart failure. In this short report we have presented a patient with massive ascites due to right heart failure after cardiac transplantation who was previously operated for Ebstein's anomaly and pulmonary stenosis as well as mitral and tricuspid valve repairs. Right heart failure increases the accumulation of ascites which decreases the preload of the heart and cardiac output. Aggressive paracentesis may be a definitive solution for this type of patient.
