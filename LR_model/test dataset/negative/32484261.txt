Long-term effects of high-intensity training vs moderate intensity training in heart transplant recipients: A 3-year follow-up study of the randomized-controlled HITTS study. The randomized controlled High-Intensity Interval Training in De Novo Heart Transplant Recipients in Scandinavia (HITTS) study compared 9Â months of high-intensity interval training (HIT) with moderate intensity continuous training in de novo heart transplant recipients. In our 3-year follow-up study, we aimed to determine whether the effect of early initiation of HIT on peak oxygen consumption (VO 'allied health', 'cardiology', 'clinical research', 'dysfunction', 'heart (allograft) function', 'heart transplantation', 'nursing', 'practice', 'quality of life (QoL)', 'rehabilitation'
