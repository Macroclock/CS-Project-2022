Heart transplantation in a patient with endomyocardial fibrosis due to hypereosinophilic syndrome. Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), a systemic disease that commonly involves the heart leading to progressive endomyocardial fibrosis, frequently manifests as restrictive cardiomyopathy. In this report, we describe the first case of a patient with endomyocardial fibrosis due to HES who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation at our institution. A literature review and discussion are included.
