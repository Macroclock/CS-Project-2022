Comparison of Characteristics of Patients Undergoing Heart Transplantation at the Same Hospital in Two Different Time Periods (1997-2012 and 2013-2015). Heart transplantation (HT) increases at some centers each year and decreases at others. We examined characteristics of patients having HT at the same hospital in 2 different time periods (1997-2012 and 2013-2015) by 2 different surgical groups. We compared certain clinical and morphological finding in 291 patients having HT 1997 to 2012 to finding in 228 other patients having HT from 2013 to 2015. Several significant (p <0.05) differences were found: in the most recent time period (2013-2015) compared to the earlier time period (1997-2012), the mean ages of the men were older (57 years -vs- 55 years); diabetes mellitus was more frequent (37% -vs- 21%); systemic hypertension (by history) was more frequent (59% -vs- 32%); the mean body mass index was higher (29.2 kg/m(2) -vs- 26.5 kg/m(2)), and mean heart weight was lower in both men (509 g -vs- 549 g) and women (422 g -vs- 454 g). There were insignificant (p >0.05) differences in gender, frequency of massive cardiac adiposity, underlying cardiac condition, frequency of coronary heart disease, and frequency of previous insertion of a left ventricular assist device. In conclusion, certain characteristics of patients having HT at one Texas hospital changed in several respects in 2 time periods corresponding to changes in surgeons doing the HTs.
