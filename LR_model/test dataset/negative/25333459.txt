IL-15 is decreased upon CsA and FK506 treatment of acute rejection following heart transplantation in mice. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cyclosporine A (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506) on interleukin-15 (IL-15) production during acute rejection following heart transplantation in mice. Inbred male Balb/c (H‑2d) and C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice were used to establish a heterotopic intra-abdominal cardiac transplantation model. The mice were divided in four groups: syngeneic control, allogeneic acute rejection, allogeneic rejection treated with CsA, and allogeneic rejection treated with FK506. The expression of IL-15, IL-2, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was measured using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting. A low level of IL-15 was detected in transplanted hearts of the control group, with a significant increase observed in the allogeneic acute rejection group. Compared to the allogeneic acute rejection group, IL-15 expression was significantly decreased in the CsA- and FK506-treated allogeneic rejection groups. The TNF-α expression pattern was similar to that of IL-15 in all groups. IL-2 expression was increased in the allogeneic acute rejection group and was inhibited in mice treated with CsA and FK506. In conclusion, increased IL-15 expression in rejected murine heart grafts may be reduced by CsA and FK506 in vivo.
