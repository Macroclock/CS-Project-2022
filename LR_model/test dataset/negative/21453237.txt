Treatment of chronic ascites due to right-sided heart failure by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt stent-implantation after orthotopic heart transplant. Long-term outcome after orthotopic heart transplant is often critical in patients with long-persisting right-sided heart failure and consecutive ascites. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt is an effective treatment for chronic ascites. However, a case of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt implantation after orthotopic heart transplant and left ventricular assist device bridging has not been previously reported.
