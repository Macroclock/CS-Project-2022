Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase gene expression in transplanted human heart. Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) is an enzyme involved in the epinephrine synthesis. The aim of this study was to investigate PNMT gene expression in the transplanted human heart in relation to the time elapsed from heart transplantation (HTx) and selected clinical characteristics. The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of PNMT in myocardial tissue were determined in 22 (21 males) patients at 0-12 years after HTx. Relative quantification of mRNA levels was performed using reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for correlation with heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), parameters of heart rate variability, and graft systolic and diastolic functions. During the first 3 years after HTx, PNMT mRNA levels were higher (mean +/- SEM) (0.75 +/- 0.06; n = 12) compared with later years (0.33 +/- 0.06; n = 10); (P < .01). HR variability in the low frequency band of the power spectrum (LF) was lower among patients during the first 3 years after HTx (2.73 +/- 0.31 vs 5.67 +/- 0.69 ms; P < .01). A significant negative linear correlation was observed between PNMT mRNA and LF (P = .05; r = -0.47). No association was noted between HR, BP, parameters of systolic or diastolic function, standard deviation of all RR intervals, or high frequency (0.15-0.40 Hz) bands of the 24-hour RR interval power spectrum. This work provides the first evidence of the presence of local PNMT transcription in human heart after HTx. Appearance of PNMT transcription in the myocardium after HTx may reflect autonomous "sympathicotrophy." Decreased PNMT expression with time elapsed after HTx suggests graft reinervation.
