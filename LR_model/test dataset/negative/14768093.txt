[Application of sleeve anastomosis in development of cervical heart transplantation in rats]. To simplify surgical technique and increase postoperative survival rate, sleeve anastomosis technique combined cuff technique was used in developing the model of cervical heart transplantation in rats. In this model, the hearts from 25 male SD rats were transplanted into the neck of Wistar rats by anastomosing the donor innominate artery to the recipient right common carotid artery by use of sleeve technique, and the donor pulmonary artery to the recipient right external jugular vein by use of cuff technique. After operation, the rats were treated with cyclosporine A (1.5 mg/kg, q.d.), transplanted hearts were followed by daily inspection or palpation and the allograft survival time was more than 3 days as the standard of successful operation. The mean operative time was (48.7 +/- 3.4) min, with a successful rate of 88% (22/25). Complications were anastomotic hemorrhage (1 case) and thrombosis(2 cases). During the follow-up period, 6 rats died of pulmonary infection, abscess in the neck, liver or bladder tumor. The remaining 16 transplanted hearts survived more than 3 months. The modified operation have advantages of less operative procedure, shorter operation and ischemia time and easier monitoring of graft function.
