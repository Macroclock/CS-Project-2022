BK virus associated nephropathy in native kidneys of a heart allograft recipient. Polyomavirus-mediated nephropathy is an increasingly recognized complication in renal transplant recipients, but data on the status of viral activity in the native kidneys of non-renal solid organ recipients are limited. Thirteen native kidney biopsies of heart transplant recipients with significant renal impairment were evaluated for the evidence of polyomavirus reactivation by immunohistochemistry and PCR. One case of BK virus-mediated nephropathy in a cardiac transplant recipient exposed to high levels of immunosuppressive drugs was identified. Clinical and histopathological findings of this patient progressing to terminal renal failure are discussed in detail. In conclusion, polyomavirus reactivation in native kidneys of heart transplant recipients can cause significant renal impairment and should be considered in the differential diagnosis in this patient cohort.
