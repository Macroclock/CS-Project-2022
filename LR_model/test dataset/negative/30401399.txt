Administration of Thrombomodulin (CD141) Could Improve Cardiac Allograft Survival in Mice. Thrombomodulin (TM) is a promising natural anti-coagulant therapeutic protein that is effective in the treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation. However, the mechanisms by which TM on micro-vessels enable the regulation of intimal hyperplasia remain elusive. We investigated the graft-protective effects of TM in a fully major histocompatibility complex-mismatched murine cardiac allograft transplantation model. CBA recipients transplanted with a C57BL/6 heart received intraperitoneal administration of 0.2, 2.0, and 20.0 Î¼g/day of TM for 8 days. Histological staining was conducted to assess the degree of inflammation and infiltration in the transplanted cardiac grafts. Untreated CBA recipients rejected C57BL/6 cardiac grafts acutely (median survival time [MST] was 7 days). CBA recipients exposed to the above dosages had significantly prolonged allograft survival (MSTs were 16, 21, and 37.5 days, respectively). Histologic assessments from TM-exposed recipients 2 weeks after grafting showed that the myocardium and vessel structure in their allografts were clearly preserved, and that the infiltration of inflammatory cells around coronary arteries was suppressed. TM can induce the prolongation of fully major histocompatibility complex-mismatched cardiac allograft by exerting graft protective effects within the myocardium and coronary arteries.
