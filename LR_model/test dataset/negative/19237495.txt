'I'm cured but....': perceptions of illness following treatment. The current qualitative research studied representations of illness posttreatment from a heart transplant group, a panic disorder group, and a tic disorder group. All three groups were preoccupied with perceptions about the impact of the illness, perception of self and the perception of how others view the ill person. The heart transplant group seem to adopt an active style of coping compared to the panic disorder group who presented a more passive, anticipatory mode of coping, and the tic group who were preoccupied with control over the perceptions of others. This qualitative information could help optimize adaptation strategies.
