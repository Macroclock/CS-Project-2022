Implantation of the continuous flow HeartWare® left ventricular assist device. Recent outstanding clinical advances with new mechanical circulatory systems have led to additional strategies in the treatment of end-stage heart failure. Heart transplantation can be postponed and for certain patients even replaced by smaller implantable left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). Mechanical support of the failing left ventricle enables appropriate haemodynamic stabilization and recovery of secondary organ failure, often seen in these severely ill patients. These new devices may be of great help to bridge patients until a suitable cardiac allograft is available but are also discussed as definitive treatment for patients who do not qualify for transplantation. Main indications for LVAD implantation are bridge to recovery, bridge to transplantation or destination therapy. An LVAD may be an important tool for patients with an expected prolonged period on the waiting list, for instance those with blood group O or B, with high or low body weight and those with potentially reversible secondary organ failure and pulmonary artery hypertension. However, LVAD implantation means an additional heart operation with inherent perioperative risks and complications during the waiting period. Finally, cardiac transplantation in patients with prior implantation of an LVAD represents a surgical challenge. The care of patients after the implantation of miniaturized LVADs, such as the HeartWare® system, seems to be easier than following pulsatile devices. The explantation of such devices at the time of transplantation is technically more comfortable than after HeartMate II implantation. 'Heart failure', 'HeartWare® system', 'Ventricular assist device'
