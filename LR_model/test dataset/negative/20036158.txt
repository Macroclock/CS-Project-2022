Severe aortic regurgitation and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction: outcomes after isolated aortic valve replacement and combined surgery. In patients with severe aortic regurgitation and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), uncertainty remains whether to recommend aortic valve replacement (AVR) over heart transplantation, especially when mitral regurgitation and/or coronary heart disease coexist. We assessed outcomes in 26 consecutive AVR patients aged </=70 years with severe aortic regurgitation and reduced LVEF, comparing the group undergoing isolated AVR with the group requiring combined surgery. The difference in mortality and morbidity between the groups was 10% vs 6%, which was not significant (p = 0.6 in both cases). Also observed was a significant improvement in functional class and a reduction in LV end-diastolic diameter from a median value of 69 to 64 mm in the isolated AVR group and to 66 mm in the combined group (p < 0.05). AVR in patients with symptomatic severe aortic regurgitation and reduced LVEF is feasible, even in the presence of concomitant mitral regurgitation and/or coronary heart disease requiring a combined surgical procedure.
