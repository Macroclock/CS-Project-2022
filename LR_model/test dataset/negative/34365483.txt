Mediating effect of coping strategies on the relation between social support and depressive symptoms among patients after cardiac transplantation. This study aimed to evaluate the role of different types of coping strategies as a mediator in social support and depressive symptoms among patients after cardiac transplantation. 123 participants after heart transplantation took part in the study. All the participants completed self-report questionnaires using the following instruments: Beck Depression Inventory Short Form (BDI SF), Berlin Social Support Scales (BSSS) and Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (the brief COPE). Actually received social support and perceived available social support (both emotional and instrumental) proved to have a significant direct impact on the occurrence of depression. Coping strategies mediated the correlation between the actually received social support, the perceived available emotional social support and depressive symptoms. The individuals with low perceived available support and the actually received social support (both emotional and instrumental), as well as those resorting to the coping strategies of avoidance and denial, proved to be prone to experiencing depressive symptoms. A significant mediating effect on depressive symptoms was identified between active coping, planning, positive reframing, self-blame, and the actually received support. All social support types were found to be directly correlated with symptoms of depression. Coping strategies proved to mediate the correlation between the perceived social support and depression.
