[Donor heart preservation with University of Wisconsin solution and immunosuppressive therapy with drip-infusion of tacrolimus]. Clinical approach for heart transplantation in Kyushu University Hospital Heart Center about donor heart preservation and immunosuppressive therapy is reviewed. University of Wisconsin solution has been used for donor heart preservation as the 1st-line solution, because left ventricular function after both 6-hour and 24-hour preservation with University of Wisconsin solution was superior to that with Celsior solution on the cross-circulated rabbit heart preparation model. Donor hearts are arrested by the extracellular-type cardioplegia to prevent coronary vasoconstriction associated with preservation in University of Wisconsin solution. Tacrolimus has been used as immunosuppressive agent. Drip-infusion of tacrolimus (0.02 mg/kg per day) is started immediately after heart transplantation aiming at definitive blood level control.
