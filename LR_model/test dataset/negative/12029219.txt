Health-related quality of life before and after solid organ transplantation. Measurement consideration, reported outcomes, and future directions. The initial focus in organ transplantation clinical research was demonstrating acceptable technical and survival outcomes. Both patient and graft survival have reached well-documented, laudable levels, and solid organ (liver, heart, kidney, lung) transplantation procedures are now relatively common. As with any complex medical procedure that entails relatively high risk, financial costs, and life-long follow-up care, reliable and valid assessments of the "quality" of the extended life years are of interest to patients, their families, policy makers, and payers. This review focuses on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and functional performance in adults following solid organ transplantation, with an emphasis on: 1) instruments and methods; 2) outcomes in liver, heart, kidney, and lung transplant recipients; and 3) future research directions. Practical considerations for developing longitudinal HRQOL assessment strategies are reviewed. The current emphasis on modeling demographic and clinical factors that promote or limit optimal HRQOL is illustrated. These lines of research will help identify potential interventions designed to promote better HRQOL in organ transplant recipients.
