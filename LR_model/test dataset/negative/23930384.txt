The Thoratec CentriMag for pediatric right ventricular failure. Acute right ventricular failure post heart transplantation in the pediatric population has not been well documented. Treatment using medical therapies including inotropes and nitric oxide are often inefficient for pediatric patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been traditionally used in children until a long-term decision can be made. As a result of the emergence of smaller assist devices, pediatric practitioners now have more options available to treat this patient population. We describe the successful use of the Thoratec CentriMag in a pediatric patient posttransplantation with acute right ventricular failure.
