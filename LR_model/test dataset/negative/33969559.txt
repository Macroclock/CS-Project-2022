Prevalence of iron deficiency in heart transplant recipients. Optimal iron management is crucial to marginal patients such as heart transplant recipients. As inflammatory mechanisms are present in transplant recipients, the definition of iron deficiency used in the general population might not be appropriate. To evaluate the prevalence and determinants of iron deficiency in Norwegian heart transplant recipients. We consecutively assessed iron parameters in all Norwegian heart transplant recipients at their annual follow-up. Several definitions of iron deficiency suggested in the literature were assessed: ferritin <100 µg/L, or ferritin 100-300 µg/L combined with transferrin saturation of <20% (ID 179 of 378 heart transplant recipients (47%) had iron deficiency defined as ID Iron deficiency defined as ID 'cardiac transplant recipients', 'exercise capacity', 'health-related quality of life', 'heart transplant recipients', 'heart transplantation', 'iron deficiency'
