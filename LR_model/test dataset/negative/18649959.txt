Predictors of all-cause mortality for patients with Chagas' cardiomyopathy listed for heart transplantation. This study sought to determine independent predictors of all-cause mortality for patients with Chagas' disease heart failure listed for heart transplantation. Need of inotropic support (p=0.01; hazard ratio=14.68, 95% Confidence Interval 1.86 to 115.82) and the Transpulmonary Gradient (p=0.02; HR=1.15, 95% Confidence Interval 1.03 to 1.30) were established independent predictors of all-cause mortality.
