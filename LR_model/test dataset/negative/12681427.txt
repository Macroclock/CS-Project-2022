Anasarca caused by Cryptococcus neoformans after heart transplantation. Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic infection caused by the yeast-like fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. The infection predominantly strikes patients with cell-mediated immunodeficiency, that is, patients with organ transplants, leukemia, lymphoma, AIDS, and those receiving steroids or immunosuppressants. We describe a patient with skin lesions and anasarca secondary to intestinal infection from Cryptococcus neoformans after heart transplantation. We based diagnosis on histologic examination of the cutaneous lesions and of the duodenal mucosa. This case demonstrates that in immunosuppressed patients with anasarca of unknown origin, a diagnosis of intestinal opportunistic infection also should be considered.
