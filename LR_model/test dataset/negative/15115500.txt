Efficacy of imiquimod 5% cream for basal cell carcinoma in transplant patients. Imiquimod 5% cream has proven to be effective in superficial and nodular basal cell carcinomas in nonimmunosuppressed patients and treating squamous cell carcinomas in situ in transplant patients. The objective of this open-label study was to determine the efficacy of imiquimod 5% cream in treating basal cell carcinoma in transplant patients. At our unit, four renal transplant patients and one cardiac transplant patient were diagnosed with 10 basal cell carcinomas in 2001. Four tumours were superficial, three nodular and three infiltrative. Five basal cell carcinomas received imiquimod 5% cream at night four times weekly for 6 weeks, without occlusion, and the other five tumours were treated on 5 nights per week for 5 weeks. Biopsies taken 6 weeks after the end of treatment showed no tumour in seven of 10 of the cases. Notably, all four superficial basal cell carcinomas, two of the three of nodular lesions and one of the three of infiltrative cases had completely cleared.
