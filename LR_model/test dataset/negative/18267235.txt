Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) induction in a pediatric heart transplant: successful outcome and rationale for its use. Despite increasing clinical experience in adult transplantation, induction therapy with alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) has rarely been reported in pediatric solid-organ transplants, and has been limited to kidneys, intestine and multi-visceral organs. Basic science research and clinical observations reported from the adult experience suggest potential benefits of alemtuzumab in pediatric organ recipients. We report successful induction therapy with alemtuzumab and steroid-free maintenance therapy for cardiac transplantation in a teenager, and discuss its merits in this patient.
