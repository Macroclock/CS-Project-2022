CMR-derived extracellular volume fraction (ECV) in asymptomatic heart transplant recipients: correlations with clinical features and myocardial edema. Myocardial interstitial expansion seems to be fundamental to the process of adverse left ventricular remodeling. Recent evidence has shown that the extracellular volume fraction (ECV) derived from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can be used as a noninvasive method to quantify myocardial interstitial volume in a range of heart diseases. Our aim was to determine whether ECV is increased in asymptomatic orthotopic heart transplant (HTx) patients and its associations with clinical features and T2 values, the elevation of which usually suggests myocardial edema. A group of asymptomatic cardiac transplant recipients and some healthy volunteers were invited to undergo a comprehensive CMR scan, including cine imaging, late gadolinium enhancement, T1 mapping and T2 mapping, from March to June in 2017. All quantitative measurements were averaged from the basal and mid short-axis slices. Fifty-eight recipients (mean age, 42.7 ± 11.5 years; 13 females), at a median of 1.8 years (0.3-6.3 years) after HTx, and 20 healthy volunteers (mean age, 39.5 ± 11.3 years; 5 females) underwent the CMR scan. We found that both the ECV and T2 values were higher in the post-HTx group (ECV: 26.7 ± 3.3 vs. 24.6 ± 2.5%, p = 0.008; T2: 47.7 ± 2.8 vs. 44.5 ± 1.6 ms, p < 0.001) than in the control group. ECV was moderately associated with organ ischemia time at the time of transplantation but not with the hemodynamics parameter or the time since transplantation at CMR. Additionally, a relatively strong correlation was observed between ECV and T2 (r = 0.7, p < 0.001). So, our conclusion is that CMR-derived ECV is increased and associated with peri-transplant ischemia time in asymptomatic HTx patients. And the strong correlation of ECV with elevated T2 indicates that myocardial edema may be an important part of the extracellular volume expansion after heart transplantation.
