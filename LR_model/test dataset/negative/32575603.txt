Risk Factors and Management of Osteoporosis Post-Transplant. Bone and mineral disorders are common after organ transplantation. Osteoporosis post transplantation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Pathogenesis of bone disorders in this particular sub set of the population is complicated by multiple co-existing factors like preexisting bone disease, Vitamin D deficiency and parathyroid dysfunction. Risk factors include post-transplant immobilization, steroid usage, diabetes mellitus, low body mass index, older age, female sex, smoking, alcohol consumption and a sedentary lifestyle. Immunosuppressive medications post-transplant have a negative impact on outcomes, and further aggravate osteoporotic risk. Management is complex and challenging due to the sub-optimal sensitivity and specificity of non-invasive diagnostic tests, and the underutilization of bone biopsy. In this review, we summarize the prevalence, pathophysiology, diagnostic tests and management of osteoporosis in solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.
