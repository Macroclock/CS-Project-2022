Cardiac rehabilitation program improves exercise capacity in heart transplantation recipients regardless of marginal donor factors. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is recommended to improve exercise capacity after heart transplantation (HTx); however, the effects of marginal donor factors are unclear. Forty-one recipients participated in a 3-month CR program early after HTx (mean age 39 ± 14 years; 88% male). Patients were divided into marginal (≥ 2 marginal donor factors; n = 24) and control groups (< 2 marginal donor factors; n = 17). We examined donor and recipient factors related to change in peak oxygen uptake (peak VO 'Donor factor', 'Exercise capacity', 'Heart transplantation', 'Knee extensor muscular strength', 'Peak oxygen uptake'
