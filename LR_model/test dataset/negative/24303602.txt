Regional perfusion during venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a case report and educational modules on the concept of dual circulations. A challenging aspect of managing patients on venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) is a thorough understanding of the relationship between oxygenated blood from the ECMO circuit and blood being pumped from the patient's native heart. We present an adult V-A ECMO case report, which illustrates a unique encounter with the concept of "dual circulations." Despite blood gases from the ECMO arterial line showing respiratory acidosis, this patient with cardiogenic shock demonstrated regional respiratory alkalosis when blood was sampled from the right radial arterial line. In response, a sample was obtained from the left radial arterial line, which mimicked the ECMO arterial blood but was dramatically different from the blood sampled from the right radial arterial line. A retrospective analysis of patient data revealed that the mismatch of blood gas values in this patient corresponded to an increased pulse pressure. Having three arterial blood sampling sites and data on the patient's pulse pressure provided a dynamic view of blood mixing and guided proper management, which contributed to a successful patient outcome that otherwise may not have occurred. As a result of this unique encounter, we created and distributed graphics representing the concept of "dual circulations" to facilitate the education of ECMO specialists at our institution.
