Acquired toxoplasmosis after orthotopic heart transplantation in a sulfonamide-allergic patient. We report the case of a young adult with a history of an allergic reaction to a sulfonamide antibiotic who developed toxoplasmosis after his second orthotopic heart transplant. As a result of this drug allergy, the patient did not receive prophylaxis with trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. He was successfully treated with clindamycin, pyrimethamine, and folic acid.
