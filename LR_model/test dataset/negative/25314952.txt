Cardiovascular magnetic resonance parameters associated with early transplant-free survival in children with small left hearts following conversion from a univentricular to biventricular circulation. We sought to identify cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) parameters associated with successful univentricular to biventricular conversion in patients with small left hearts. Patients with small left heart structures and a univentricular circulation who underwent CMR prior to biventricular conversion were retrospectively identified and divided into 2 anatomic groups: 1) borderline hypoplastic left heart structures (BHLHS), and 2) right-dominant atrioventricular canal (RDAVC). The primary outcome variable was transplant-free survival with a biventricular circulation. In the BHLHS group (n = 22), 16 patients (73%) survived with a biventricular circulation over a median follow-up of 40 months (4-84). Survival was associated with a larger CMR left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume (EDV) (p = 0.001), higher LV-to-right ventricle (RV) stroke volume ratio (p < 0.001), and higher mitral-to-tricuspid inflow ratio (p = 0.04). For predicting biventricular survival, the addition of CMR threshold values to echocardiographic LV EDV improved sensitivity from 75% to 93% while maintaining specificity at 100%. In the RDAVC group (n = 10), 9 patients (90%) survived with a biventricular circulation over a median follow-up of 29 months (3-51). The minimum CMR values were a LV EDV of 22 ml/m² and a LV-to-RV stroke volume ratio of 0.19. In BHLHS patients, a larger LV EDV, LV-to-RV stroke volume ratio, and mitral-to-tricuspid inflow ratio were associated with successful biventricular conversion. The addition of CMR parameters to echocardiographic measurements improved the sensitivity for predicting successful conversion. In RDAVC patients, the high success rate precluded discriminant analysis, but a range of CMR parameters permitting biventricular conversion were identified.
