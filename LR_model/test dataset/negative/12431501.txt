Late Aspergillus fumigatus endomyocarditis with brain abscess as a lethal complication after heart transplantation. We report the case of a 65-year-old male patient who died from lethal Aspergillus fumigatus endomyocarditis and multiple cerebral septic emboli 6 months after cardiac transplantation. This complication developed 4 weeks after diagnosis of bilateral pulmonary aspergillosis, which was immediately treated by surgical removal and intravenous amphotericin B. Preceding colonization with Aspergillus spp was not identified. Primary cytomegalovirus infection (donor+/recipient-) and toxoplasmosis reactivation (donor+/recipient+) occurring at 1 and 2 months post-transplantation were successfully treated.
