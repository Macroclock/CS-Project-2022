Pediatric heart transplantation-What are the risk factors for pacemaker implantation and how much pacing is required? In an attempt to improve pacemaker therapy after pediatric transplantation, we investigated risk factors, indication for pacing, and pacing burden after pediatric heart transplantation. In this retrospective study, 139 pediatric heart transplant recipients, of whom 122 did not and 17 did require pacemakers, were investigated. Eleven of the 17 patients requiring a permanent pacemaker (PPM) received their heart from a female donor (68.8%); this compares to 48 of 122 patients (43.2%, P  =  0.082) in the group not requiring a pacemaker (No PPM). The donor age and height were significantly greater in the PPM group at a median of 25.26 years (16.29-48.00) and 160 cm (153-170) compared with 11.96 years (1.73-19.95) and 141 cm (89-165) in the No PPM group (P  =  0.003 and 0.015, respectively). Of the 17 patients requiring pacemakers, 13 presented with sinus node dysfunction (SND) and four with atrioventricular block. The atrial pacing burden in patients with SND remained above 60% within the 5 years of follow-up investigated. There was no significant difference in mortality between those patients requiring a PPM and those not (Log-Rank test: P  =  0.672). We found that in our cohort donor characteristics were key risk factors for pacemaker implantation in transplanted children. The data suggest that when patients require a pacemaker in posttransplant SND, they will require a relevant amount of pacing for at least 5 years. The pacing burden after this point remains to be investigated. Mortality does not differ between pediatric heart transplant patients with and without pacemakers.
