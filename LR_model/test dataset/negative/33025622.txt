Identification of peripheral CD154 Decreasing graft rejection and increasing graft and patient survival are great challenges facing liver transplantation (LT). Different T cell subsets participate in the acute cellular rejection (ACR) of the allograft. Cell-mediated immunity markers of the recipient could help to understand the mechanisms underlying acute rejection. This study aimed to analyse different surface antigens on T cells in a cohort of adult liver patients undergoing LT to determine the influence on ACR using multi-parametric flow cytometry functional assay. Thirty patients were monitored at baseline and during 1Â year post-transplant. Two groups were established, with (ACR) and without (NACR) acute cellular rejection.
