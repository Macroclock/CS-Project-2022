Mechanical circulatory support: 60â€‰years of evolving knowledge. Since the 1950s when the first devices for mechanical circulatory support were developed, there has been an impressive evolution of their technology. The first pioneering pumps were used to rescue acute complications after cardiac surgery. Advances in technology, increased knowledge of flow dynamics, and a more appropriate selection of the patients who actually need this support have contributed to significantly improve the benefits of this therapy. Today, mechanical circulatory support is an essential tool for the treatment of advanced heart failure. This strategy is used either as a bridge to heart transplantation or as a destination therapy for patients who do not meet the transplant criteria. A third indication is the bridge to recovery option for those patients in whom the improvement in cardiac function may be so important that the pump can be removed and the transplantation circumvented. In addition, mechanical circulatory support has fostered marked improvements in several clinical aspects affecting both patient health and quality of life. Despite the improvements in the technology of the devices of the last generation, severe adverse effects are still the Achilles heel of mechanical circulatory support therapy. This review summarizes the history, the technology, the clinical outcomes, and the possible future directions of this therapy.
