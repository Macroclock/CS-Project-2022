The current state of, and future prospects for, cardiac transplantation in children. During the last two decades, several advances have resulted in marked improvement in medium-term survival, with excellent quality of life, in children undergoing cardiac transplantation. Improved outcomes reflect better selection of donors and recipients, increased surgical experience in transplantation for complex congenital heart disease, development of effective surveillance for rejection, and wider choice of immunosuppressive medications. Despite all of these advances, recipients continue to suffer from the adverse effects of non-specific immunosupression, including infections, induction of lymphoproliferative disorders and other malignancies, renal dysfunction, and other important end-organ toxicities. Furthermore, newer immunosuppressive regimes, thus far, appear to have had relatively little impact on the incidence of chronic rejection. Progress in our understanding of the immunologic mechanisms of rejection and graft acceptance should lead to more targeted immunosuppressive therapy and avoidance of non-specific immunosupression. The ultimate goal is to induce a state of tolerance, wherein the recipient will accept the allograft indefinitely, without the need for long-term immunusupression, and yet remain immuno-competent to all non-donor antigens. This quest is currently being realized in many animal models of solid organ transplantation, and offers great hope for the future.
