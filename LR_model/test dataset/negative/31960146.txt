Elevated plasma tyrosine kinases VEGF-D and HER4 in heart failure patients decrease after heart transplantation in association with improved haemodynamics. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are implicated in cardiovascular growth and remodelling. We aimed to identify the plasma levels of RTKs and related proteins and their association with haemodynamic alterations in heart failure (HF) and related pulmonary hypertension (PH) following heart transplantation (HT). Using proximity extension assay, 28 RTKs and related proteins were analysed in plasma from 20 healthy controls and 26 HF patients before and 1-year after HT. In end-stage HF, out of 28 RTKs, plasma vascular endothelial growth factor-D (VEGF-D) and human epidermal growth factor-4 (HER4) were elevated compared to controls (p < 0.001), but decreased (p < 0.0001) and normalised after HT. Following HT, plasma changes (Δ) of VEGF-D correlated with Δmean pulmonary artery pressure (r 'Haemodynamics', 'Heart failure', 'Heart transplantation', 'Pulmonary hypertension', 'Receptor protein-tyrosine kinases'
