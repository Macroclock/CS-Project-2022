Cardiac resynchronization therapy in an infant with double outlet right ventricle and mechanical dyssynchrony. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is commonly used in adults with heart failure, poor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and wide QRS complex. CRT has rarely been applied in young patients. We report the case of a 10-month-old infant with congenital heart disease, postsurgical complete atrioventricular block, and severe refractory heart failure. The patient showed a significant clinical improvement and was withdrawn from the heart transplant list 2 months after epicardially established CRT.
