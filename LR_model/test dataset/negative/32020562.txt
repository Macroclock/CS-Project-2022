Oral health-related quality of life of patients after heart transplantation and those with heart failure is associated with general health-related quality of life: a cross-sectional study. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in patients after heart transplantation (HTx) and those with heart failure (HF). In total, 186 participants (HTx: 104, HF: 82) were recruited from the University Department for Cardiac Surgery, Leipzig Heart Centre, Germany. OHRQoL was assessed with the German short form of the oral health impact profile (OHIP-G14). Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was evaluated using the short form 36 survey (SF-36). Furthermore, the dental and periodontal treatment need was recorded. With an OHIP-G14 sum score of 6.58 ± 6.40 [5; 2.5-8] in the HTx group and 5.54 ± 5.47 [5; 2-7] in the HF group, no clinically relevant or statistically significant difference was apparent (p = 0.39). The SF-36 scales for physical functioning, role-physical, general health and vitality were significantly worse in the HF group compared with the HTx group (p The OHRQoL in HF and HTx patients appears to be mainly associated with general HRQoL. Therefore, multidisciplinary dental care concepts may be recommended to improve oral health conditions in these patients.
