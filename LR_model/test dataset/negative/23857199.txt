Endobronchial hamartoma. We present images of an endobronchial hamartoma visible by bronchoscopy in the left lower lobe. A 56-year-old woman with a late presentation of an acute anterior myocardial infarction requires urgent heart transplantation and subsequently has trouble weaning off the ventilator. Bronchoscopic evaluation reveals a 1 cm endobronchial hamartoma obstruction the left lower lobe bronchus. A polypectomy snare was effectively used with electrocautery to excise the lesion. The patient was successfully able to wean off the ventilator once the left lower lobe was free from obstruction.
