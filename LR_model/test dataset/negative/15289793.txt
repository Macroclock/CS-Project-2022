Rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics in heart transplant recipients administered an antirejection regimen including cyclosporine. Cyclosporine (INN, ciclosporin) increases the systemic exposure of all statins. Therefore rosuvastatin pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed in an open-label trial involving stable heart transplant recipients (> or =6 months after transplant) on an antirejection regimen including cyclosporine. Rosuvastatin has been shown to be a substrate for the human liver transporter organic anion transporting polypeptide C (OATP-C). Inhibition of this transporter could increase plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin. Therefore the effect of cyclosporine on rosuvastatin uptake by cells expressing OATP-C was also examined. Ten subjects were assessed while taking 10 mg rosuvastatin for 10 days; 5 of these were then assessed while taking 20 mg rosuvastatin for 10 days. Rosuvastatin steady-state area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours [AUC(0-24)] and maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) were compared with values in controls (historical data from 21 healthy volunteers taking 10 mg rosuvastatin). Rosuvastatin uptake by OATP-C-transfected Xenopus oocytes was also studied by use of radiolabeled rosuvastatin with and without cyclosporine. In transplant recipients taking 10 mg rosuvastatin, geometric mean values and percent coefficient of variation for steady-state AUC(0-24) and Cmax were 284 ng. h/mL (31.3%) and 48.7 ng/mL (47.2%), respectively. In controls, these values were 40.1 ng. h/mL (39.4%) and 4.58 ng/mL (46.9%), respectively. Compared with control values, AUC(0-24) and Cmax were increased 7.1-fold and 10.6-fold, respectively, in transplant recipients. In transplant recipients taking 20 mg rosuvastatin, these parameters increased less than dose-proportionally. Rosuvastatin had no effect on cyclosporine blood concentrations. The in vitro results demonstrate that rosuvastatin is a good substrate for OATP-C-mediated hepatic uptake (association constant, 8.5 +/- 1.1 micromol/L) and that cyclosporine is an effective inhibitor of this process (50% inhibition constant, 2.2 +/- 0.4 micromol/L when the rosuvastatin concentration was 5 micromol/L). Rosuvastatin exposure was significantly increased in transplant recipients on an antirejection regimen including cyclosporine. Cyclosporine inhibition of OATP-C-mediated rosuvastatin hepatic uptake may be the mechanism of the drug-drug interaction. Coadministration of rosuvastatin with cyclosporine needs to be undertaken with caution.
