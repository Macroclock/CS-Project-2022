Mycophenolate and sirolimus as calcineurin inhibitor-free immunosuppression improves renal function better than calcineurin inhibitor-reduction in late cardiac transplant recipients with chronic renal failure. Calcineurin-inhibitor-(CNI)-induced renal failure is one major cause of morbidity in cardiac transplantation (HTx). In this prospective, randomized, multicenter trial, the impact of immunosuppressive conversion toward CNI-free (mycophenolate mofetil [MMF] and sirolimus) or a CNI-reduced immunosuppressive regimen on renal function, efficacy, and safety was evaluated. Since 2004, 63 HTx-patients (0.5-18.4 years after HTx) with CNI-based immunosuppression and reduced creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min (39+/-15 mL/min) were included in this trial. Patients in the CNI-free-Group (group 1) were converted to sirolimus that was started with 2 mg/day until target trough levels (8-14 ng/mL) were achieved. Subsequently, CNIs were withdrawn. In CNI-reduction-Group (group 2), CNI target trough levels were reduced by 40%. In both groups MMF was continued and trough level adjusted (1.5-4 microg/mL). Patients demographics and survival (mean follow-up time: 16.7+/-9 months) was equal (100%). Renal function improved significantly after complete CNI withdrawal while remaining unchanged with CNI-reduction (Creatinine clearance after 12 months: 53+/-24 mg/dL [group 1] vs. 38+/-20 mg/dL [group 2], P=0.01). End-stage renal failure (hemodialysis) was avoided by CNI-withdrawal and occurred only after CNI reduction (n=6; P=0.01). Acute rejection episodes were more common in group 2 (4 vs. 2). Graft function remained stable (echocardiography) within both groups. Adverse events were more common in group 1 (65%) than in group 2 (n=40%) and were responsible for discontinuation in 4 and 0 cases, respectively. Conversion toward a CNI-free immunosuppression (Mycophenolate, sirolimus) is superior to CNI-reduced immunosuppression in improving renal failure in late HTx-recipients. However, this benefit is relativized by the increased incidence and severity of sirolimus/MMF-associated side effects.
