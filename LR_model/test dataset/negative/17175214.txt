T-cell depletion eliminates the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy in mice rendered tolerant by the induction of mixed chimerism. We previously demonstrated that cardiac allografts to fully tolerant chimeric mice developed cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). Here we begin to examine which components of the immune system are responsible for the pathogenesis of CAV in such tolerant recipients. B10.A/B6 mixed chimeric mice were created by receiving injections of bone marrow cells from B10.A (H-2k) mice given to C57BL/6 (B6; H-2b) mice with some preparations. B10.A skin grafts were first placed onto B10.A/B6 mixed chimeric recipients. When the donor strain skin grafts had survived perfectly for at least 56 days, B10.A hearts were transplanted heterotopically into B10.A/B6 mixed chimeric recipients. Hearts were examined for the presence of CAV 56 days later. To determine the effector cells that contribute to the development of CAV, they were treated weekly with a combination of anti-CD4/CD8 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or anti-NK1.1 mAb continuing until 56 days. 14 B10.A cardiac transplants of 18 otherwise untreated B10.A/B6 chimeric recipients developed CAV; concurrent B6 isografts were unaffected (0/7). In chimeric recipients treated with anti-CD4/8 mAbs, the prevalence of CAV was greatly reduced (0/6, P < .01 compared to the untreated group). Anti-NK1.1 mAb was not effective in the prevention of CAV (4/5). These data suggest that T cells may contribute in some way to the development of CAV that occurs in those fully tolerant recipients. Host T cells that may still be responsive to non-major histocompatability complex antigens, including tissue-specific antigens presented not on skin but on heart, may also be responsible for the development of CAV in tolerant animals.
