Safety and Efficacy of Immunoadsorption in Heart Transplantation Program. Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is a serious complication of organ transplantation, and its treatment is complex. The aim of this study was to assess immunoadsorption (IA) for treatment-immunized patients before heart transplantation (HTX) and as the first step of AMR treatment after HTX. The cohort consisted of 10 patients (8 men, 2 women; age range, 20-57 years). For 3 of these patients, IA was included in the desensitization protocol before HTX; for 7 patients, IA was the first step of the treatment protocol. One patient underwent IA before and after HTX. A comparison of values before IA and after the last procedure showed a decrease in immunoglobulin subgroups (G, M, and A). In patients before HTX, a decline was noted in panel reactive antibodies. After HTX, IA procedures led to a significant decrease in donor-specific antibody (DSA) class I; DSA class II fell in 6 of 7 patients, with 51% falling below the detection limit. IA in patients during HTX is safe procedure for reducing DSA. The removal of antibodies is the first step in comprehensive treatment and must be followed by a procedure that prevents their further development.
