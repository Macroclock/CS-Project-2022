Early pediatric anthracycline cardiotoxicity: managed by serial heart and bone marrow transplantation. We report a favorable outcome in a child who underwent cardiac transplantation for severe early post-anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy, 9 months after completion of treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The child suffered a relapse of AML 2 months after cardiac transplantation and then underwent a successful bone marrow transplant. This case is unique in the literature. We believe it offers an alternative strategy for children with hematologic malignancies, where severe early post-anthracycline cardiotoxicity might preclude bone marrow transplantation.
