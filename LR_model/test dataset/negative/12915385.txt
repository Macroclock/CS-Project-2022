Dual upregulation of Fas and Bax promotes alloreactive T cell apoptosis in IL-10 gene targeting of cardiac allografts. Activation-induced cell death and cytokine deprivation are demonstrated by peripheral T cell populations at the conclusion of natural immune responses, and each of these processes is modulated by the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 in vitro. This study employs a clinically relevant in vivo model of IL-10 gene transfer with heterotopically transplanted cardiac allografts to determine the mechanisms of the effects of IL-10 on T cell survival. IL-10 protein overexpression within allografts 4-5 days after gene transfer augments apoptosis of CD4+ and CD8+ graft-infiltrating lymphocytes by 7.1-fold (P < 0.001) and 6.0-fold (P < 0.001), respectively. Graft-infiltrating T cells express 10-fold more proapoptotic Fas (P < 0.01) and 30-fold more Bax (P < 0.01) than controls. The fractions of activated caspase-8 (FADD-like IL-1beta-converting enzyme) and activated caspase-9 were increased 7- and 2.3-fold, respectively, in IL-10 gene-treated allografts at postoperative day 4-5. These changes in the Fas-Fas ligand pathway and Bcl-2 mitochondrial apoptosis regulation are enhanced by complete suppression of antiapoptotic FADD-like IL-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitory protein (FLIP) (from 30.5 to 0.0%, P < 0.01) and Bcl-xL (from 22.5 to 0.1%, P = 0.03) expression among these cells from the earliest days after gene transfer. Although changes in proteins of Fas- and Bcl-2-mediated apoptosis signaling occur, only the levels of Fas and FLIP correlate to the rate of apoptosis of graft-infiltrating CD3 lymphocytes and histological rejection scores. These results indicate that dichotomous apoptosis-regulatory pathways are affected by IL-10 gene therapy, but Fas-mediated mechanisms of activation-induced cell death more substantially contribute to the greater cell death of graft-infiltrating T cells after ex vivo IL-10 gene transfer.
