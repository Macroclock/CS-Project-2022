Heart transplantation: Early Results of Two Different Regimes of Immnunosuppression. The management of induction and maintenance immunosuppression therapy after heart transplantation (HT) remains a controversial issue. The dosage and the timing has been a changing target. We aimed at evaluate the incidence of acute cellular rejection (ACR) [≥1R grade], major infection and survival in first year after HT in patients receiving two different induction immunosuppression regimes and with a reduction in intensity of triple maintenance immunosuppression dose. From November-2003 to June-2016, 317 patients were submitted to HT. After excluding those with pediatric age (n=8), those with previous renal or hepatic transplantation (n=2), those submitted to retransplantation (n=2), patients with early death without endomiocardial biopsy (n=10) and those in a transition maintenance regime (n=26), the study population resulted in 269 patients. These patients were divided in two groups: patients receiving the previous regime of two doses of basiliximab (group A, n=211) and those receiving a single dose of basiliximab (group B, n=58). All the patients were treated with a maintenance standard triple immunosuppressive regimen of corticosteroids, an inhibitor of calcineurin and mycophenolate mofetil but more immunosuppressive load in group A. Mean age of the recipients (group A vs. group B) was 54.6±10.6vs.55.0±9.8 years (p=0.808); 77.3%vs.75.9% were male (p=0.861); 28.4%vs.28.1% were diabetic (p=0.957); and ischemic etiology was present in 39.8%vs 41.0% of the patients (p=0.798), respectively. No differences were found, at first year, between the two groups concerning global ACR incidence (55.0%vs.56.9%, p=0.882, respectively) but major ACR (≥2R grade) was slightly superior in group B (16.6%vs.27.6%, p=0.080, respectively). Time-free from major ACR at 3rd, 6th and 12th months was, respectively 91.0±2.0%vs.84.5%±4.8%; 86.7±2.3%vs.74.1±5.7%; and 83.4±2.6%vs.72.4±5.9% (p=0.048). Time-free from major infection at 3rd, 6th and 12th months was, respectively 89.6±2.1%vs.82.8±5.0%; 87.7±2.3%vs.79.3±5.3%; and 84.4±2.5%vs.79.3±5.3% (p=0.253). No differences were found concerning survival at 3rd, 6th and 12th months (94.3±1.6%vs.94.8±2.9%; 92.4±1.8%vs.93.1±3.3%; and 90.0±2.1%vs.91.4±3.7%, (p=0.771) respectively). With this study, we verified that lowering doses of induction and maintenance therapy was responsible for increase cases of major ACR at first year of heart transplant. However, no differences were found concerning the incidence of major infection and early survival. Hence, effective immunosuppression induction regimen can apparently be done safely with a single dose regime without compromising survival at first year after HT.
