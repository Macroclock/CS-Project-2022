One heart, two bodies: a simulation study of body surface potential differences between donor and recipient of heart transplantation. In cardiac transplantation has been recognized some "abnormalities" in recipient ECG. We investigated the influence of heart geometrical position within the chest cavity as well as somatometric parameters on body surface torso potentials. Two control patients with different Body Mass Index (BMI) were undergone a chest MRI scan. Using specific software we created two tetrahedral meshes that could be applied in our study. A post-mortem human heart was undergone a MRI scan and we also created its tetrahedral mesh. Using second software we extracted the heart mesh of control's torsos and we replaced them with the mesh of the post-mortem heart. The last program also assessed the influence of heart (re)positioning within the thorax, on the body surface potentials. The Finite Elements Method (FEM) was used to solve the forward electrocardiographic problem for both torsos, under the assumption that all the ventricular myocardium of the one post-mortem heart was excited. FEM was also applied in simulating Body Surface Potential Mapping (BSPM) on the first thorax torso for nine different heart positions. For BSPM, FEM has been applied on Poison equation. The results show higher BSPM in patient with lower BMI and significant changes in BSPM when heart was rotated round its long axis. Conversely, the heart shifts (long x- or y- axis) didn't cause significant changes on simulated BSPM.
