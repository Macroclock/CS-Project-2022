Initial experience in Japan with HeartWare ventricular assist system. We describe the first clinical experiences in Japan with the HeartWare ventricular assist device (HVAD: HeartWare Inc., Miami Lakes, FL, USA) in patients awaiting heart transplantation. Nine patients (6 males, 3 females; mean 33.5 ± 7.8 years; New York Heart Association class III or IV) received the HVAD as a bridge to transplantation between 2011 and 2012. Six had dilated cardiomyopathy, 2 secondary cardiomyopathy, and 1 dilated phase hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. All operations were uneventful, with a mean operation time of 269 ± 77 min and cardiopulmonary bypass time of 121 ± 40 min. One required a temporary right ventricular assist device and was weaned on postoperative day 20, while another required pump exchange due to foreign tissue in the inflow. Mean support duration was 245 ± 162 days (range: 50-535 days) and mean pump blood flow at 1 month postoperatively was 4.8 ± 0.8 l/min. There was no mortality after 30 days, though 1 patient died during support due to cerebral hemorrhage. Presently, the others are waiting for heart transplantation without problems, except 1 who suffered from an active infection. There was no pump mechanical failure in any case. The HeartWare pump enables quick implantation with acceptable morbidity and mortality. Our preliminary results indicate that this left ventricular assist device is safe for circulatory assistance for heart transplant candidates in Japan.
