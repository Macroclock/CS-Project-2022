Incidence of vasoplegic syndrome after cardiac transplantation in patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan. Vasoplegic syndrome (VS) is associated with poor outcomes after heart transplantation (HT). Our aim was to determine whether SAC/VALS is associated with VS after HT. We retrospectively analyzed all consecutive HT performed in three centers between January 2017 and August 2018. VS was defined as vasopressor need (norepinephrine or epinephrine >.5 mcg/kg/min or vasopressin) for more than 24 hours to maintain a mean arterial pressure >70 mm Hg. Ninety-six recipients underwent HT in the study period: 60 elective HT with no LVAD, 5 elective HT on long term LVAD, and 31 emergent HT: 3 on long-term LVAD and 28 on temporary mechanical circulatory support. Fourteen patients were on SAC/VALS treatment at the time of transplant, and 82 were not. The global incidence of VS was 15.6%, with no significant differences between the groups (7.14% in with SAC/VALS vs 17.07% in no-SAC/VALS). In conclusion, in our small cohort SAC/VALS was not associated with VS development. 'heart transplant', 'sacubitril', 'valsartan', 'vasoplegic syndrome'
