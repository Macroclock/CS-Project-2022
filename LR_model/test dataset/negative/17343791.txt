[The effects of sinomenine on the expresssion of ICAM-1 and IL-2 during the rejection of rat cardiac allograft]. To observe the pathological characteristics of the rejection of rat cardiac allograft, study the effects and mechanisms of sinomenine on the rejection of rat cardiac allograft. The rat model of heterotopic cardiac allograft was established. The rats were randomly divided into four groups: Group A(control group of healthy SD rats), Group B (cardiac allograft of SD to SD rats), Group C (cardiac allograft of SD to Wistar rats) and Group D (sinomenine treated group of cardiac allograft of SD to Wistar rats). ELISA and immunohistochemical staining were carried out to estimate the expression level of IL-2 and ICAM-1 in the grafts. Little ICAM-1 and IL-2 was observed in both Group A and Group B and the infiltration of lymphocytes was not so obvious. In group C, ICAM-1 and IL-2 were increased significantly and the infiltration of lymphocytes was obviously. In group D, inflammatory reaction and infiltration of lymphocytes were much less than those in group C, and ICAM-1 and IL-2 is expressed weakly. The expression level of ICAM-1 and IL-2 was relevant to the occurrence and development of graft rejection. Sinomenine could obviously reduce the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule and the infiltration of lymphocytes in the grafts and prolong grafts survival significantly.
