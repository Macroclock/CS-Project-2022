Ivabradine as a heart rate-lowering agent in a patient with end-stage renal failure after heart transplantation. A 56 year-old woman with a transplanted heart, with arterial hypertension and chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, was hospitalised because of palpitations, dyspnea, chest pain and oedema. After cyclosporine treatment she was diagnosed with renal failure, which was treated by hemodialysis. Heart rate (HR) at admission was 100, mean HR in 24-hour Holter monitoring was 106 bpm. Ivabradine was added to the treatment. The dose of 2.5 mg bid was doubled after three days. Mean HR in control Holter monitoring was 81. Ivabradine was well tolerated in this patient. The clinical benefits were observed soon after application and maintained during the follow-up.
