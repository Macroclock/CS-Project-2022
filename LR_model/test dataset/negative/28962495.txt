Is there a role for upper-extremity intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation as a bridge-to-recovery or a bridge-to-transplant in the treatment of end-stage heart failure? A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was: Is there a role for upper-extremity intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation (UE-IABP) in the treatment of end-stage heart failure? Altogether 230 papers were found using the reported search, of which 6 papers represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. Of the 163 bridge-to-transplantation (BTT) patients, 141 (86.5%) were successfully transplanted and of the 9 bridge-to-recovery (BTR) patients, 6 (66.7%) were successfully weaned from the device. Length of support ranged from 3 to 152 days, and the most frequent complications were device malfunction or migration necessitating exchange or repositioning, occurring at a collective rate of 37.3%. UE-IABP is a minimally invasive and cost-effective strategy that provides haemodynamic support while preserving both the mediastinum and the functional status in BTR and BTT patients who may not tolerate more invasive modes of mechanical circulatory support. We conclude that UE-IABP can be used as a bridge-to-recovery (BTR) or transplant (BTT) in patients with end-stage heart failure.
