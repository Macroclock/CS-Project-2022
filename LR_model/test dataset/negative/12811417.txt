[Update cardiology 2001/2002-part II. From unstable coronary syndrome to terminal heart failure]. The cardiovascular continuum describes the way from risk factors to atherosclerosis, acute cardiovascular events (unstable angina and myocardial infarction), and development of terminal heart failure and its complications. Following this way, advances are reported in the therapy of acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, ventricular and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, and stroke in patients with patent foramen ovale. The following issues are reported in detail: (1) significance of statins and statin withdrawal, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blocker, acute coronary interventions, aspirin and clopidogrel in unstable coronary syndromes, (2) pathogenesis of acute pulmonary edema associated with hypertension, (3) cardiac regeneration capability after transplantation and myocardial infarction, (4) beta-blocker therapy, efficacy of additional angiotensin receptor blocker therapy and multisite biventricular pacing in symptomatic (advanced) heart failure, (5) prognosis after ablation of the atrioventricular node in patients with atrial fibrillation, (6) primary prevention with an implantable defibrillator and resumption of driving after implantation, and (7) therapeutic options after cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale.
