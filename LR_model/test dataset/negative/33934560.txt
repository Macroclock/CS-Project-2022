Successful heart transplantation for COVID-19-associated post-infectious fulminant myocarditis. Various clinical presentations of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been described, including post-infectious acute and fulminant myocarditis. Here, we describe the case of a young patient admitted for COVID-19-associated post-infectious fulminant myocarditis. Despite optimal pharmacologic management, haemodynamic status worsened requiring support by veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Emergent heart transplantation was required at Day 11 given the absence of cardiac function improvement. The diagnosis of post-infectious COVID-19-associated myocarditis was made from both pathologic examination of the explanted heart and positive SARS-CoV-2 serology.
