Jarvik 2000 axial-flow ventricular assist device placement to a systemic morphologic right ventricle in congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries. Few descriptions of the implantation and management of an implantable ventricular assist device in patients with complex congenital heart disease exist in the literature. The Jarvik 2000 axial-flow ventricular assist device (Jarvik Heart, Inc., NYC, NY, USA) can be placed in either the left or the right ventricle. We present the case of a 60-year-old man with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries who underwent successful placement of a Jarvik 2000 axial-flow ventricular assist device in a systemic morphologic right ventricle.
