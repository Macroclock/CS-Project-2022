Improved poststorage cardiac function by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition: role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Akt pathway. Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP) has been shown to be effective in minimizing cardiac ischemia reperfusion injury. We investigated the cardioprotective effect of the PARP inhibitor, INO-1153, in isolated working rat hearts after 6 hr of hypothermic storage in Celsior. Hearts were treated with 1 muM INO-1153 before hypothermic storage, at cardioplegia and storage or after hypothermic storage. Hearts not exposed to INO-1153 served as controls. Another group was pretreated with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor Wortmannin (0.1 muM) before storage in INO-1153-supplemented Celsior. After baseline measurement of aortic flow, heart rate, coronary flow, and cardiac output were obtained, hearts were arrested and stored in Celsior at 2-3 degrees C for 6 hr. After storage, hearts were reperfused for 15 min before performing work for a further 30 min, at which time poststorage indices of cardiac function were remeasured then heart tissue was stored at -80 degrees C for Western blot analysis. The presence of INO-1153 during prestorage perfusion or during cardioplegia and storage significantly improved poststorage cardiac function. Functional improvements produced by INO-1153 were completely abolished by Wortmnanin pretreatment. Western blots showed a significant increase in phospho-Akt in presence of INO-1153, which was inhibited by Wortmannin. Activation of the prosurvival phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway was involved in the protective action of PARP inhibition in this model of donor heart procurement and hypothermic storage. Importantly for the logistics of clinical organ procurement, maximum protection is observed when the PARP inhibitor is included in the cardioplegic storage solution.
