The European Registry for Patients with Mechanical Circulatory Support (EUROMACS): first EUROMACS Paediatric (Paedi-EUROMACS) report. EUROMACS is a registry of the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) whose purpose is to gather clinical data related to durable mechanical circulatory support for scientific purposes and to publish annual reports. Because the treatment of children with end-stage heart failure has several significantly different characteristics than the treatment of adults, data and outcomes of interventions are analysed in this dedicated paediatric report. Participating hospitals contributed pre-, peri- and long-term postoperative data on mechanical circulatory support implants to the registry. Data for all implants in paediatric patients (≤19 years of age) performed from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2017 were analysed. This report includes updates of patient characteristics, implant frequency, outcome (including mortality rates, transplants and recovery rates) as well as adverse events. Twenty-five hospitals contributed 237 registered implants in 210 patients (81 ♀, 129 ♂) to the registry. The most frequent diagnosis was any form of cardiomyopathy (71.4%) followed by congenital heart disease (18.6%). Overall mean support time on a device was 11.6 months (±16.5 standard deviation). A total of 173 children (82.4%) survived to transplant, recovery or are ongoing; 37 patients (17.6%) died while on support within the observed follow-up time. At 12 months 38% of patients received transplants, 7% were weaned from their device and 15% died. At 24 months, 51% of patients received transplants, 17% died while on support, 22% were on a device and 9% were explanted due to myocardial recovery. The adverse events rate per 100 patient-months was 11.97 for device malfunction, 2.83 for major bleeding, 2.83 for major infection and 1.52 for neurological events within the first 3 months after implantation. The first paediatric EUROMACS report reveals a low transplant rate in European countries within the first 2 years of implantation compared to US data. The 1-year survival rate seems to be satisfactory. Device malfunction including pump chamber changes due to thrombosis was the most frequent adverse event.
