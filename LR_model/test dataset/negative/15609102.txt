Changes in dolichol and pentosidine levels in the age-mismatched heterotopically transplanted rat heart. To address some basic questions about primary and secondary events in the process of aging in different cell and tissue types, we studied changes in the levels of biomarkers of the aging cells (dolichol) and connective tissue (pentosidine) in the heart of older (22-month-old) Lewis rats heterotopically transplanted in younger (3-month-old) syngenic recipients. Results showed that age-mismatched transplantation did not alter the age-related accumulation of dolichol and significantly reduced the accumulation of pentosidine in cardiac tissue. It is concluded that aging of heart muscle and connective tissues is controlled by two independent clocks; that accumulation of dolichol in older tissues may be a primary consequence of the process of aging, whereas the accumulation of pentosidine may be secondary, perhaps to changes in circulating cells endowed with advanced glycation end products-specific receptors; in the perspective of organ transplantation, the environment of a younger host may positively interact with the graft and rejuvenate its collagen.
