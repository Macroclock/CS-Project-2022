Heart transplantation. Over the past 40 years, heart transplantation has become a routine treatment for end-stage heart failure. Over 3000 heart transplants are performed annually. Despite improvements in short-term outcomes, long-term survival remains limited. Current efforts remain directed at alleviating the shortage of donor organs, developing effective treatments for chronic rejection, and improving mechanical circulatory support for heart failure.
