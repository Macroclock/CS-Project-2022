LMNA mutations in cardiac transplant recipients. Lamin A and C are components of the nuclear envelope, located at the nucleoplasmatic surface of the inner nuclear membrane within cells. Recently, mutations within LMNA encoding lamin A/C have been associated with various disease entities including cardiomyopathy. We screened heart transplant recipients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with a positive family history of LMNA mutations. Four index patients and one relative belonging to four unrelated families carrying LMNA mutations were identified. The mutations p.Q355X and p.S22L have not been reported before, whereas p.R190W has already been reported in other studied DCM cohorts. In the patients of the present study, the mean age at manifestation of heart disease was 37.6 years (range 30-45 years), with progression to end-stage heart failure requiring transplantation at a mean age of 45.8 years (range 35-54 years). Three patients presented initially with atrial fibrillation. These data confirm the involvement of LMNA mutations in patients with DCM and extend the mutational spectrum of LMNA. The p.R190W mutation has been reported in different populations and may therefore be useful for analyzing the impact of a specific LMNA mutation on the phenotype of muscle disease.
