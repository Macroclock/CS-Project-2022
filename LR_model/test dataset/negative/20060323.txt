Asymptomatic infection with novel influenza A/H1N1 virus in a heart transplant recipient. The spectrum of manifestations and management of the novel influenza A/H1N1 virus in transplanted patients is currently of major concern. Asymptomatic infections are less common yet important for spreading of the virus and thus affect containment measures. To our knowledge, there are no reports of asymptomatic infections with influenza A/H1N1 in immunosuppressed patients. We present the first case of a young heart transplant recipient who remained asymptomatic despite positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after exposure to individuals with influenza A/H1N1.
