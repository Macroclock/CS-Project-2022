Ezetimibe effectively lowers LDL-cholesterol in cardiac allograft recipients on stable statin therapy. We investigated tolerability and efficacy of ezetimibe treatment (10 mg/d) in 25 heart allograft recipients already on stable statin therapy. Total cholesterol (TC), low-density cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), immunosuppressant drug levels, laboratory and clinical parameters were assessed before, four months and one yr after initiation of ezetimibe treatment. Mean equivalent statin dose was 53.5 +/- 12.3 mg of pravastatin, remaining unchanged throughout the study period. Ezetimibe was generally well tolerated, only two patients (8%) discontinued ezetimibe due to stomach pain or headache. Mean TC decreased from 231.8 +/- 6.4 mg/dL before therapy to 202.2 +/- 8.8 mg/dL after four months and 192.9 +/- 7.0 mg/dL after one yr (p < 0.001). Mean LDL-C decreased from 143.1 +/- 5.4 mg/dL to 121.4 +/- 7.9 mg/dL (month 4; p < 0.05) and 107.1 +/- 5.6 mg/dL (one yr; p < 0.001). TG decreased from 182 +/- 14.3 mg/dL to 173.3 +/- 17.5 mg/dL after one yr (p < 0.05), whereas HDL-C was unchanged. Initial LDL-C and cardiac diagnosis before transplantation were identified as predictors of absolute LDL-C reduction. Immunosuppressant drug doses and blood concentrations were unchanged as well as other laboratory and clinical parameters. Ezetimibe appears safe and effective for further reduction of TC and LDL-C in heart allograft recipients already on stable statin therapy. Extent of pre-treatment LDL-C and cardiac disorder prior to transplantation appear to correlate with the efficacy of ezetimibe therapy.
