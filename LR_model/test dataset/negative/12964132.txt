[The influence of anxiety, depression and post traumatic stress disorder on quality of life after thoracic organ transplantation]. This study examines stress factors, resources of coping, psychopathological symptoms and their influence on health-related quality of life (QoL) in patients after heart or lung transplantation. 82 Patients were examined with the questionnaires SF-36 (QoL), HADS-D (anxiety and depression), IES-R and PTSS-10 (post traumatic stress disorder, PTSD) 32.3 (4-86) months after transplantation. Stress factors, resources and diagnostic criteria for PTSD were investigated by structured interview. In the entire sample, anxiety, depression and QoL were in the range of normal population. A subgroup of 13 patients with a PTSD diagnose had significantly reduced QoL. Anxiety and intrusion explained the 42 % variance of psychosocial score of QOL. There was a lower influence of depression on the medical score of QoL. Psychological symptoms such as anxiety, depression and PTSD significantly influence QoL after heart or lung transplantation. Patients with a PTSD diagnose had poor QoL. Screening for PTSD should be part of routine evaluation after organ transplantation.
