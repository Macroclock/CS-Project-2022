Comparison of hospital-supervised exercise versus home-based exercise in patients after orthotopic heart transplantation: effects on functional capacity, quality of life, and psychological symptoms. In heart transplant patients it is common to observe a reduced exercise capacity and diminished quality of life. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a hospital-based exercise program versus that of a home-based exercise program on the functional capacity, quality of life, and psychological symptoms among heart transplant patients. Thirty-eight heart transplant patients were randomly placed into two groups: a hospital-based exercise program (group 1, n = 15) or a home-based exercise program (group 2, n = 13). All patients performed flexibility, stretching, aerobic, strengthening, breathing, and relaxation exercise programs for 8 weeks. We performed estimates of functional capacity (maximal oxygen consumption-pVO2), quality of life (Short Form-36-SF36), and psychological symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-BDI, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-STAI). In group 1, significant increases were observed in pVO2 and all SF36 subgroups, with the exception of vitality and social function subgroups (P < .05). Significant increases were not observed on the BDI or STAI (P > .05). Group 2 failed to show significant improvements in any variable, with the exception of the score on the bodily pain subgroup of the SF36 (P > .05). Based on our clinical results, we recommend a well-organized exercise program performed in a rehabilitation unit to improve postoperative exercise capacity and quality of life among heart transplant patients.
