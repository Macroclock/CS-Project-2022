[Multiple organ transplantation]. Liver transplantation is the most demanding of all solid organ tranplantations. It requires perfect organization and motivation of health care professionals, patients and their families. This article deals with the procedure for multiple organ procurement, reviews criteria for organ donation and describes the surgical tehnique for multiple organ procurement. Adequate selection and evaluation of cadaveric donors and of organs for transplantation should include early identification of potential donors, and early diagnosis of brain death. The procurement of the highest number of viable organs jbfor transplantation requires excellence in each of the phases. Early and aggressive physiologic support in the maintenance of fotential donors can reduce organ donor loss due to irreversible asystole or multiorgan jafiure (it is almost always possible to maintain organ perfusion pressure) and increase the number of organs without increasing post-transplant morbidity or mortality. The ideal donor is a young, previously healthy, brain dead, victim of an accident. The surgical procedure for multiple organ procurement from brain death donors must be performed without intraopertive organ damage.
