Prevalence of cardiac allograft vasculopathy assessed with coronary angiography versus coronary vascular ultrasound and virtual histology. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a major factor limiting long-term survival after heart transplantation (HT). The purpose of this study was to characterize the coronary artery structure and to determine the prevalence of vasculopathy after HT, comparing the sensitivity of coronary angiography with that of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and virtual histology (VH). A prospective recruitment cross-sectional study was performed in 31 adult HT recipients including 22 men and, 9 women of overall mean age of 45.2 ± 12.6 years at an average of 3.7 ± 3.7 years after transplantation. They underwent simultaneously coronary angiography and IVUS assessment of the left anterior descending coronary artery. We investigated histological composition of the intima. Final data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric tests. IVUS discovered the presence of CAV among 17/31 (54.8%) patients versus coronary angiography in 10 (32.3%; P = .009). The histological composition of the intima as assessed with IVUS VH was 26.1% fiber, 8.7% necrotic core, 5.7% calcium, and 4.3% lipid. There was no significant association between preexistent risk factors and the presence of CAV. There was a correlation between time elapsed since HT and CAV development. Time elapsed since HT is the most important risk factor for the development of CAV. Its prevalence almost doubled when measured with IVUS in contrast with angiography. IVUS was thus shown to be a more sensitive diagnostic tool compared with coronary angiography.
