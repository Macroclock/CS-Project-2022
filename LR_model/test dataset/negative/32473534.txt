Methodological Challenges Encountered in a Study of the Impact of Animal-assisted Intervention in Pediatric Heart Transplant Patients. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the impact of animal-assisted intervention (AAI) on ambulation, physiologic stability, patient satisfaction, and perceived benefit in hospitalized pediatric heart transplant patients. This pilot study used a two-period, two-sequence cross-over design. Using a convenience sample of heart transplant patients between the ages six and nineteen, each subject participated in one AAI and one non-AAI study session over one week. All study sessions started with an aspect of walking. Three males and two females participated. Average age was 15 years. Subjects walked on average 1906 ft during the AAI session as compared to 1933 ft in the non-AAI session. Subjects spent a longer time (17 min) walking in the AAI session as compared to the non-AAI session (15 min). Blood pressure and respiratory rates remained stable. All subjects reported they liked working with the dog. Eighty percent of subjects actively engaged in physical contact and communication with the dog. No safety-related adverse events were reported. AAI may assist adolescent heart transplant patients to be more motivated to participate in therapeutic ambulation when walking with a dog. Further studies are needed to identify successful recruitment strategies in this highly vulnerable patient population. Many clinical challenges exist in implementing AAI research in the pediatric heart transplant population. A conceptual model is introduced to better understand the methodological challenges of conducting AAI research in the hospital setting. Key components include research, organizational, AAI, subject and time factors.
