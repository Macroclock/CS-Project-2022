Sinusoidal CD30+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma can masquerade as anaplastic large cell lymphoma in pediatric posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a known complication of solid organ transplantation. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is frequently seen in this setting. However, CD30+ DLBCL with sinusoidal pattern of involvement has not been reported in pediatric PTLD. We are reporting a 9-year-old female child presented with diffuse lymphadenopathy postheart transplantation. The pattern of involvement was suggestive of anaplastic large cell lymphoma, but the malignant cells were positive for B-cell markers and negative for anaplastic lymphoma kinase. The patient was treated aggressively with multiagent chemotherapy and rituximab. Accurate diagnosis in PTLD is paramount in making management decisions.
