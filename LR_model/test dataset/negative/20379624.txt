Refractory heart failure in a patient with non-compacted myocardium. The non-compacted myocardium is characterized by excessive trabeculation and ventricular recesses (usually of the left ventricle) due to the interruption of the myocardial fiber compaction during embryogenesis. This abnormality usually courses with heart failure, thromboembolic phenomena and cardiac arrhythmia, predicting a bad prognosis. We report the case of a 26-year-old male individual with refractory heart failure due to isolated left ventricular non-compacted myocardium that needed a heart transplant.
