Switch from assist device to total artificial heart to improve cardiac output. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) offer the opportunity to substantially improve the clinical condition and to interrupt the hospitalization of patients suffering from end-stage heart failure awaiting heart transplantation.We report a case of a 30-year-old patient (body surface area 2.49 m2) suffering from idiopathic dilative cardiomyopathy who was primarily given an LVAD with a free floating impeller pump and was finally switched to a total artificial heart due to the demand for a higher cardiac output.
