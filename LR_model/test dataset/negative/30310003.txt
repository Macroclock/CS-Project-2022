[Omental Flap for the Device Infection of the HeartMate II]. Case 1:An 18-year-old male underwent emergent left extracorporeal ventricular assist device(eVAD) implantation for a cardiogenic shock because of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). After listing for heart transplant, he underwent a HeartMate II implantation as bridge-to-bridge(BTB) therapy. The omental flap was simultaneously used to prevent device infection that could have been induced by the infected malgranulation around the cannulas of the eVAD. Eventually, he was discharged and waiting for transplantation. Case 2:A 30-year-old male with DCM underwent emergent eVAD implantation for left ventricular support, centrifugal veno-pulmonary artery extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for right ventricular and respiratory support, and mitral valve replacement. After weaning of ECMO, he was listed for a heart transplant and underwent a HeartMate II implantation as BTB therapy. However, liver dysfunction and malnutrition prolonged wound healing. Despite applying vacuum assist closure device to promote wound healing, part of the driveline and pump housing were exposed. Therefore, radical debridement and omentopexy were performed for infection control. He was discharged after complete wound healing.
