Pericardial Adipose Tissue Volume and Left Ventricular Assist Device-Associated Outcomes. Pericardial adipose tissue (PAT) is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in those with and without established heart failure (HF). However, it is not known whether PAT is associated with adverse outcomes in patients with end-stage HF undergoing left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. This study aimed to evaluate the associations between PAT and LVAD-associated outcomes. We retrospectively measured computed tomography-derived PAT volumes in 77 consecutive adults who had available chest CT imaging prior to HeartMate 3 LVAD surgery between October 2015 and March 2019 at Duke University Hospital. Study groups were divided into above-median (â‰¥219 cm In patients with end-stage HF undergoing LVAD therapy, PAT is not associated with worse 2-year LVAD-related outcomes. The significance of regional adiposity vs obesity in LVAD patients warrants further investigation.
