Heterotopic heart transplantation: where do we stand? Orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) is a well established and commonly utilized procedure for end-stage heart failure patients. Heterotopic heart transplantation (HHT) is a surgical procedure that allows the graft to be connected to the native heart in a parallel fashion. The main advantage of HHT is to assist the patient's native heart and to maintain circulation in the cases of severe acute rejection. HHT has also been proposed to overcome pulmonary hypertension, to increase the size of the donor pool and to decrease waiting times without increasing morbidity caused by the procedure. However, only a few papers have reported the short- or long-term results of HHT, and most of these studies have included <30 cases. OHT remains the standard technique and is preferable whenever the patient meets the current criteria and a suitable organ is available. HHT is far less useful than in the past because of the major advances in immunosuppression therapy and the development of long-term mechanical circulatory support. This study reviews the origin of HHT and discusses clinical developments, including their advantages and disadvantages.  'Heterotopic', 'Orthotopic', 'Transplantation'
