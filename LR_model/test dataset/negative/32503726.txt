Donor heart and lung procurement: A consensus statement. Heart and lung procurements are multiphased processes often accompanied by an array of complex logistics. Approaches to donor evaluation and management, organ procurement, and organ preservation vary among individual procurement teams. Because early graft failure remains a major cause of mortality in contemporary thoracic organ transplant recipients, we sought to establish some standardization in the procurement process. This paper, in this vein, represents an international consensus statement on donor heart and lung procurement and is designed to serve as a guide for physicians, surgeons, and other providers who manage donors to best optimize the clinical status for the procurement of both heart and lungs for transplantation. Donation after brain death (DBD) and donation after circulatory determination death (referred to as donation after circulatory death [DCD] for the remainder of the paper) for both heart and lung transplantation will be discussed in this paper. Although the data available on DCD heart donation are limited, information regarding the surgical technique for procurement is included within this consensus statement. Furthermore, this paper will focus on adult DBD and DCD heart and lung procurement. Currently, no certification, which is either recognized and/or endorsed by the transplant community at large, exists for the training of a cardiothoracic procurement surgeon. Nevertheless, establishing a training curriculum and credentialing requirements are beyond the scope of this paper. 'donation after circulatory death', 'heart', 'lung', 'procurement', 'thoracic donor'
