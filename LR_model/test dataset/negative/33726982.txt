Monitoring of perfusion quality and prediction of donor heart function during ex-vivo machine perfusion by myocardial microcirculation versus surrogate parameters. Currently, lactate (Lac) is used to evaluate machine perfusion (MP) of hearts, donated after circulatory death (DCD). We hypothesize that monitoring of myocardial microcirculation (mLDP) by Laser-Doppler-Perfusion is superior to Lac to evaluate perfusion and predict contractility. In a pig model, DCD-hearts were perfused 4 hours followed by reperfusion and left ventricular contractility measurement. Lac and mLDP were measured every 30 min in successfully (N = 9) and unsuccessfully (N = 7) maintained hearts. Successfully maintained hearts showed decreasing Lac (5.6 to 2.8 mmol/L) and slightly downregulated (92%) mLDP. In unsuccessfully maintained hearts Lac first decreased (5.1 to 3.8 mmol/L) followed by increase and mLDP dropped to 39%. In a single-variable regression only mLDP showed a significant r² for systolic (0.514, p = 0.045) and diastolic (0.501, p = 0.049) parameters.
