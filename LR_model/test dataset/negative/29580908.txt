[Extracorporeal life support and heart-lung transplant in children]. Extracorporeal life support and heart and/or lung transplant are the last resort in children with end-stage cardiac and/or pulmonary failure and short-term life threaten. Currently, circulatory support is used as a bridge to recovery or as a bridge to transplant but not as a destination therapy. The Excor Berlin Heart is the long-lasting external pneumatic ventricular assist system that is currently available from infancy to adulthood. Long-term prognosis after pediatric cardiac and/or pulmonary transplant is conditioned by the occurrence of graft failure, coronary disease of the cardiac graft, viral infections and bronchiolitis obliterans of the pulmonary graft, the incidence of which increase with time. The scarcity of grafts and the risk of acute rejection due to lack of compliance with immunosuppressive treatment require the transplant specialized teams to choose the best candidates according to psychosocial and biological criteria. The next expected developments concern mainly long-term ventricular assistance with systems that allow for greater autonomy and a return to the child's home.
