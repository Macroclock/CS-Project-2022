[Preliminary study on cardiac allograft rejection in mice by Extractum trametes robiniophila murr]. To study the effect of Extractum trametes robiniophila murr on cardiac allograft rejection in mice. All abdominal heterotopic heart transplantation models were divided into three groups as follows: (A) Extractum trametes robiniophila murr group. (B) Rejection group. (C) Isograft group. In each group, mean survival times (MST) of transplanted hearts and their pathologic histological changes at postoperative fifth day were observed. With fluoroimmunoassay, granzyme B and CD8(+) expressions were examined. The MST of heart allografts in group A were (6.38 +/- 0.69) d, significantly shorter than that of group B [(8.31 +/- 0.59) d] (P < 0.01). In group A, acute rejection was present in advance; transplanted hearts were seriously damaged into acute rejection pathological grade 3, and CD8(+) T lymphocytes infiltrated diffusely and the expression of granzyme B increased significantly as compared with other groups. Exclusive application of Extractum trametes robiniophila murr can promote the acute rejection of graft in early phase of postoperation, and the mechanism may be the promoted proliferation and infiltration of CD8(+) T lymphocytes and the increased expression of granzyme B.
