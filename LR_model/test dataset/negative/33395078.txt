Ambulatory advanced heart failure patients: timing of mechanical circulatory support - delaying the inevitable? Current indications for continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (cfLVAD) implantation is for patients in cardiogenic shock or inotrope-dependent advanced heart failure. Risk stratification of noninotrope dependent ambulatory advanced heart failure patients is a subject of registries designed to help shared-decision making by clinicians and patients regarding the optimal timing of mechanical circulatory support (MCS). The Registry Evaluation of Vital Information for VADs in Ambulatory Life enrolled ambulatory noninotrope dependent advanced systolic heart failure patients who had 25% annualized risk of death, MCS, or heart transplantation (HT). Freedom from composite clinical outcome at 1-year follow-up was 23.5% for the entire cohort. Seattle Heart Failure Model Score and Natriuretic pepides were predictors with modest discriminatory power. Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) profile 4 patients had the highest risk (3.7-fold) of death, MCS or HT compared to INTERMACS profile 7. We propose individualized risk stratification for noninotrope dependent ambulatory advanced heart failure patients and include serial changes in end-organ function, nutritional parameters, frailty assessment, echocardiographic and hemodynamic data. The clinical journey of a patient with advanced heart failure should be tracked and discussed at each clinic visit for shared decision-making regarding timing of cfLVAD.
