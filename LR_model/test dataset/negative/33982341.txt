Mending hearts: A further strategy to improve cardiac donors availability. Patients listed for heart transplantation are increasing annually worldwide, but the limited number of available donor hearts restricts this treatment to a small fraction of potential recipients. Attempts have, therefore, been made to expand the donor pool by recruiting donors who may not satisfy the standard criteria for organ donation. We reviewed our early experience by using three donor hearts which were successfully transplanted either after correction or not of pre-existing defects (Case #1: Coronary fistula; Case #2: Takayasu syndrome; Case #3: Percutaneously repaired atrial septal defect), demonstrating that structural cardiac abnormalities might not always be an absolute contraindication to donation candidacy.
