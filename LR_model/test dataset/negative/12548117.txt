Tolerance induction in rats, using a combination of anti-CD154 and donor splenocytes, given once on the day of transplantation. Donor-specific tolerance induction remains an attractive objective that generates much research in the field of transplantation. Unfortunately, most of the protocols available involve pregraft conditioning, making these treatments incompatible with clinical applications. LEW.1A rats were grafted with histoincompatible LEW.1W hearts. On the day of transplantation, recipients were treated with anti-CD40L combined with donor splenocytes. The hearts were evaluated for graft survival; cellular infiltrate and intragraft cytokines were determined using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Tolerance induction was assessed by skin grafting and adoptive transfers. The combination of a single injection of anti-CD40L and donor splenocytes, given on the day of surgery, allowed 40% of cardiac allografts to survive long-term (mean survival time=66.3 day). The cellular composition or the extent of graft infiltrate was not modified but was associated with a massive decrease of proinflammatory cytokines expression within the graft. Long-term survivors accepted donor-matched skin grafts, and leukocytes harvested from these animals transferred tolerance into irradiated freshly grafted recipients. A combination of costimulation blockade and donor cells, given once at the time of transplantation, is sufficient to induce allograft tolerance in rats.
