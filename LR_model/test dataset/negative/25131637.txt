Setting the stage for development of a program for adolescent heart transplant recipients to transition to adult providers: An integrative review of the literature. This integrative review of the literature was undertaken to determine if there was a body of knowledge to support a transition program in an adolescent heart transplant population. No studies were found involving a heart transplant transition program for adolescents. A literature review for transition in other chronic illness areas was undertaken. Youth with chronic illness are inadequately prepared to transfer to adult providers. Transition programs should be developed. These programs should be tailored to suit individual needs. They should teach disease knowledge and encourage participation in self-management skills. Participation in a transition program improved patients' quality of life and improved their knowledge about their disease. Nurses are in a unique position with chronically ill adolescents to promote positive behaviors at every interaction. Encouraging self-management behaviors will support these youth as they prepare to become adults. 'Adolescent', 'chronic illness', 'heart transplant', 'literature review', 'transition'
