Factors Related to the Severity of Early Postoperative Infection After Heart Transplantation in Patients Surviving Prolonged Mechanical Support Periods: Experience at a Single University. The authors examined the effect of prolonged support with continuous-flow ventricular assist devices (CF-VADs) and other related factors on the severity of infections within 30 days of heart transplantation (HTx). A retrospective analysis of consecutive HTx procedures. University hospital, between 2010 and 2016. A cohort of 53 heart transplantation recipients (median age, 38.5 yr; interquartile range [IQR], 30.3-49.2 yr; women, 34%). Forty-nine patients required CF-VAD support (median duration, 946 d; IQR, 600-1,132 d). Severity of postoperative infections was categorized as follows: no infection, minor infection (resolved within 14 days), major infection (resolved after >14 days), and severe infection (septic shock). Results were expressed as number (frequency) and median with IQR. Potential risk factors for increased infection severity were expressed as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Postoperatively, no infection, minor infection, major infection, and severe infection occurred in 32 (60.4%), 8 (15.1%), 8 (15.1%), and 5 patients (9.4%), respectively. Active ventricular assist device (VAD)-specific infections at the time of HTx occurred in 37.7% of patients. Moderate-to-severe primary graft dysfunction occurred in 26.4% of the patients. Multivariable analysis indicated that risk factors for increased infection severity included active VAD-specific infection (OR 4.8; 95% CI 2.3-11.2) and moderate-to-severe primary graft dysfunction (OR 8.8; 95% CI 2.1-42.5) but not duration of CF-VAD support (OR 1.0; 95% CI 1.0-1.0). Active VAD-specific infection and poor graft function likely contribute to the severity of early postoperative infections after HTx.
