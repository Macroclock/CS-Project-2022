Heart Transplantation Survival Outcomes of HIV Positive and Negative Recipients. In the era of antiretroviral therapy, HIV-positive patients have reduced mortality from HIV infection and increased morbidity from end-stage heart failure. The number of HIV-positive heart transplantation recipients remains scant. Long-term survival has not been rigorously studied. We compared survival outcomes of heart transplantation in HIV-positive recipients with those of HIV-negative recipients. Clinical data from all adult heart transplantations were extracted from the United Network for Organ Sharing dataset. The impact of recipient HIV status was analyzed with Cox proportional hazards modeling, 1:3 propensity score matching, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Seventy-five HIV-positive recipients and 29,848 HIV-negative recipients were identified. Race distributions differed between the recipient groups, with black patients comprising a larger proportion of the HIV-positive recipient group (46.7% vs 20.9%, P < .001). The mean year of transplant was significantly later in the HIV-positive recipient group. The rate of acute rejection in the HIV-positive group was higher than in the HIV-negative group (38.7% vs 17.7%, P < .001), as was rate of antirejection treatment administration such as intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis (26.7% vs 10.4%, P < .001). There was no difference in 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year survival of HIV-positive recipients vs HIV-negative recipients. Recipient HIV infection was not a significant covariate in predicting survival in a Cox proportional hazards model. Short-term and moderate-term survival after heart transplantation is similar for HIV-positive recipients and HIV-negative recipients, although data are very limited. This finding suggests that HIV-positive recipients should not be excluded from transplant candidacy solely based on HIV serostatus.
