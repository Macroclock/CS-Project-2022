Disruption of murine cardiac allograft acceptance by latent cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation is a well-described complication of solid organ transplantation. These studies were performed to (1) determine if cardiac allograft transplantation of latently infected recipients results in reactivation of CMV and (2) determine what impact CMV might have on development of graft acceptance/tolerance. BALB/c cardiac allografts were transplanted into C57BL/6 mice with/without latent murine CMV (MCMV). Recipients were treated with gallium nitrate induction and monitored for graft survival, viral immunity and donor reactive DTH responses. Latently infected allograft recipients had approximately 80% graft loss by 100 days after transplant, compared with approximately 8% graft loss in na√Øve recipients. PCR evaluation demonstrated that MCMV was transmitted to cardiac grafts in all latently infected recipients, and 4/8 allografts had active viral transcription compared to 0/6 isografts. Latently infected allograft recipients showed intragraft IFN-alpha expression consistent with MCMV reactivation, but MCMV did not appear to negatively influence regulatory gene expression. Infected allograft recipients had disruption of splenocyte DTH regulation, but recipient splenocytes remained unresponsive to donor antigen even after allograft losses. These data suggest that transplantation in an environment of latent CMV infection may reactivate virus, and that intragraft responses disrupt development of allograft acceptance.
