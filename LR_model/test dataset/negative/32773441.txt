Effect of Bariatric Surgery on Cardiovascular Function and Heart Failure Outcomes. In this article, we explore the influence of obesity on cardiovascular health and the role of bariatric surgery in reducing cardiovascular comorbidities, preventing the onset of heart failure and improving mortality and quality of life in those with cardiac dysfunction. We highlight the mechanisms by which obesity leads to cardiovascular remodeling, diastolic dysfunction, and eventual heart failure. These mechanisms include systemic inflammation, local lipotoxicity by way of ectopic fat deposition, and hemodynamic alterations that have significant effects on cardiac structure and function. Bariatric surgery has been shown to reverse these mechanisms, thereby leading to the reversal of adverse cardiac remodeling, improved diastolic function, and in some cases, improved systolic function in patients with systolic heart failure. Most importantly, bariatric surgery leads to significant improvements in cardiovascular outcomes, including the risks of myocardial infarction and stroke, heart failure incidence, and mortality. In patients with heart failure, bariatric surgery has been shown to decrease heart failure exacerbations and admissions and improve quality of life. Furthermore, in advanced heart failure patients, including those requiring mechanical circulatory support, bariatric surgery has been successfully and safely used for weight loss, as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. Therefore, bariatric surgery should be considered as a treatment for conditions ranging from subclinical cardiac dysfunction to symptomatic, advanced heart failure.
