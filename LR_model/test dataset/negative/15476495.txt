EBV positive primary cutaneous CD30+ large T-cell lymphoma in a heart transplanted patient: case report. Most post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are of B-cell origin, whereas T-cell lymphomas rarely occur. We detail the clinicopathological features of the first case of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated primary cutaneous CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in the setting of heart transplant. A 71-year-old patient, 111 months after transplant, presented with multiple cutaneous lesions on the left thigh; histological and immunohistochemical examinations led to diagnosis of T-cell CD30+ ALCL. In situ hybridization demonstrated the presence of EBV-positive tumour cells. The patient received radiotherapy, but he relapsed at the same cutaneous site with loco-regional nodal spread. Chemotherapy was administered resulting in complete remission; four years later the patient is alive and well. Our findings indicate that primary cutaneous EBV+ CD30+ ALCLs should be included within the T-cell PTLDs spectrum; further studies are required to confirm whether they may be also considered, in transplantation settings, a distinct lymphoma subset with relatively favourable outcome.
