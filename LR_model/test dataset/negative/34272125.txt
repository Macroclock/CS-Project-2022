Recipient and surgical factors trigger severe primary graft dysfunction after heart transplant. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is a major cause of early mortality following heart transplant (HT). The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) subdivides PGD into 3 grades of increasing severity. Most studies have assessed risk factors for PGD without distinguishing between PGD severity grade. We sought to identify recipient, donor and surgical risk factors specifically associated with mild/moderate or severe PGD. We identified 734 heart transplant recipients at our institution transplanted between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018. PGD was defined according to modified ISHLT criteria. Recipient, donor and surgical variables were analyzed by multinomial logistic regression with mild/moderate or severe PGD as the response. Variables significant in single variable modeling were subject to multivariable analysis via penalized logistic regression. PGD occurred in 24% of the cohort (n = 178) of whom 6% (n = 44) had severe PGD. One-year survival was reduced in recipients with severe PGD but not in those with mild or moderate PGD. Multivariable analysis identified 3 recipient factors: prior cardiac surgery, recipient treatment with ACEI/ARB/ARNI plus MRA, recipient treatment with amiodarone plus beta-blocker, and 3 surgical factors: longer ischemic time, more red blood cell transfusions, and more platelet transfusions, that were associated with severe PGD. We developed a clinical risk score, ABCE, which provided acceptable discrimination and calibration for severe PGD. Risk factors for mild/moderate PGD were largely distinct from those for severe PGD, suggesting a differing pathophysiology involving several biological pathways. Further research into mechanisms underlying the development of PGD is urgently needed. 'clinical risk prediction', 'heart transplantation', 'ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'primary graft dysfunction'
