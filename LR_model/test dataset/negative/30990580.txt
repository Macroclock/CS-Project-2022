Outflow graft tunneling through the transverse sinus for HeartWare HVAD implantation as bridge to heart transplantation strategy. Left ventricular assist device graft protection and its intraoperative orientation continues to be a major concern in bridge-to-transplant strategy. Different techniques have been described, including the adoption of a standard full sternotomy approach. We describe our institutional experience of placement of the with HeartWare HVAD® implantable continuous flow pump, with outflow graft tunnelling through the transverse sinus to prepare patients in need of eventual re-sternotomy. Surgical tips are provided in the tutorial videos both for HVAD® placement, and for explantation at the time of heart transplantation. None
