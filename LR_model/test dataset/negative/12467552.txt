[External ventricular assist devices as circulatory support in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy]. Ventricular assist devices have demonstrated their utility in patients with intractable cardiac failure, both as support until complete myocardial recovery and as a bridge to transplantation. Specific pediatric pneumatic paracorporeal systems can be applied even in infants. Long-term survival has been reported although experience is limited. We report the case of an 8-year-old boy with dilated cardiomyopathy awaiting cardiac transplantation. The patient developed profound cardiogenic shock with multiorgan failure while being evaluated for heart transplantation. He was given biventricular assistance with the MEDOS-HIA system (MEDOS-Helmholtz Institute). Maximum stroke volume ventricles of 25 and 22 ml were used, achieving a cardiac output of 2.2 l/min in both ventricles. The patient was supported with ventricular assistance for 9 days, but multiple organ failed to improve and transplantation became impossible. Progressive loss of peripheral circulatory resistance unresponsive to treatment developed and ventricular assistance was discontinued. The previous severe shock and advanced and progressive multiorgan failure could be responsible for the poor outcome of our patient despite maintenance of adequate cardiac output. Nevertheless, the use of ventricular assist devices is a real therapeutic alternative in children with severe cardiogenic shock, allowing them to recover completely or undergo heart transplantation. Patient selection, the choice of a system of appropriate size, and early implantation seem to be the cornerstones for obtaining good results.
