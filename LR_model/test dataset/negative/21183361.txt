Utility of left ventricular systolic torsion derived from 2-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography in monitoring acute cellular rejection in heart transplant recipients. Reduced left ventricular torsion (LV-tor) has been reported to be associated with acute rejection in heart transplant (HTx) recipients. We investigated the utility of LV-tor analysis derived from 2-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) for detecting allograft rejection. A total of 301 endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs), right heart catheterizations and echocardiograms were performed in 32 HTx recipients. Echocardiography was done within 3 hours from EMB or simultaneously with the procedures. The LV-tor was defined as the difference between apical and basal end-systolic rotations. The LV-tor values with and without cellular rejection were compared. In addition, we investigated whether the change in LV-tor values predicts the change in rejection grade in each patient. The baseline LV-tor value in each patient was defined as a mean value of the first 3 LV-tor measurements obtained when the patient was free from rejection. According to the conventional International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation criteria, 274 biopsies showed a rejection Grade of 0, 1a or 1b (Group AR(-)), whereas 27 biopsies were Grade 2 or higher (Group AR(+)). LV-tor decreased more in Group AR(+) than in Group AR(-) (9.3 ± 0.7 vs 12.2 ± 0.2 degrees, p < 0.0001). In the LV-tor measurement for each patient, the 25% reduction in LV-tor value from baseline predicted Grade 2 or higher rejection with a predictive accuracy of 92.9%. LV-tor derived from 2D-STE could be of clinical value for non-invasive monitoring of acute rejection in HTx recipients.
