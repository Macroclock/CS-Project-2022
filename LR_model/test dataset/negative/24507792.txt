Special topics: cardiac markers in myocarditis: cardiac transplant rejection and conditions other than acute coronary syndrome. The utility of blood biomarkers of cardiac myocyte damage such as troponin T and I in the evaluation of acute coronary syndromes and heart failure is well established. However, some of these markers may also be elevated in other conditions, such as myocarditis, cardiac transplant rejection, and several other conditions. Recognizing this phenomenon is essential to avoid misdiagnosis of acute coronary syndromes. Furthermore, identifying an elevated troponin level in patients without acute coronary syndrome or heart failure may often have diagnostic or prognostic significance.
