Correlation of biochemical and hematological changes with graft failure following pig heart and kidney transplantation in baboons. We have explored biochemical and hematologic parameters that might indicate acute humoral xenograft rejection (AHXR) following pig organ transplantation in baboons. Baboons (n = 15) received an immunosuppressive regimen, and underwent a miniature swine or hDAF kidney (Group 1, n = 6) or heart (Group 2, n = 7) transplantation. Control baboons (Group 3, n = 2) received the immunosuppressive regimen without organ transplantation. Blood chemistry and hematologic parameters were measured daily. Baboon and porcine cytomegalovirus were monitored. In Groups 1 and 2, organ grafts survived for up to 29 days. A plasma fibrinogen of <80 mg/dL on 2 consecutive days, and a serum lactate dehydrogenase of >600 U/L and aspartate transaminase of >300 U/L, were associated with the development of AHXR in both heart and kidney grafts. In Group 1, a decrease in platelet count of >150,000/microL within 3 days, or a count of <50,000/microL, were associated with AHXR. In Group 2, a creatine phosphokinase of >500 U/L was associated with graft failure. In Group 3, no abnormalities were observed. The possibility that porcine CMV may play a role in graft injury could not be excluded. Noninvasive parameters were identified that have predictive potential for AHXR. Monitoring of these might enable therapeutic intervention to reverse rejection.
