[Is there any alternative for the heart transplantation in patients with cardiac insufficiency of terminal stage?]. The heart transplantation constitutes the method of choice in the treatment of patients, suffering heart insufficiency, tolerant to medicinal therapy. Nevertheless, the donor's organs deficiency problem makes it necessary to search for methods of surgical treatment, which are alternative to transplantation and which would secure the patients life span prolongation as well as the quality of life improvement. New approach in surgical treatment of patients, suffering severe cardiac insufficiency have proposed Brazilian surgeon R. Batista. Experience of surgical treatment of 37 patients with dilatational cardiomyopathy and severe cardiac insufficiency (functional class III-IV, NYHA) is presented. In these patients surgical remodelling of left ventricle was done together with local myocardium plasty between papillary muscles base of mitral and tricuspid valves. Fair immediate and late results are noted.
