Combination of mesenchymal stem cells and FK506 prolongs heart allograft survival by inhibiting TBK1/IRF3-regulated-IFN-γ production. Lifelong immunosuppression use presents many serious side effects to transplant recipients. Previous studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) regulate the progress of inflammation and protect allograft function. However, the benefits of MSC combined with low-dose tacrolimus (FK506) has not been investigated in heart transplant recipients, and its mechanism deserves further investigation. SD Rat bone marrow-derived MSC were infused into recipient mouse (C57BL/6, B6) through the tail vein, followed by a BALB/c donor cervical ectopic heart transplantation on the next day of infusion. T-lymphocyte subsets and their functions were determined using flow cytometry, ELISA, and qPCR. Thereafter, in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to identify the mechanisms regarding MSC and FK506 combination (MF group) use in regulating IFN-γ signaling. MF group in the allogeneic heart transplantation mouse model inhibited acute rejection and prolonged mean survival time (MST) of grafts from 7 days (d) to 22d. Pathological examination of heart grafts suggested that inflammatory cell infiltration decreased, and tissue damage was significantly reduced in the MF group. IFN-γ mRNA expression levels in the grafts and recipients decreased, while IL-4 and TGF-β mRNA expression increased in the MF group. Phosphorylation of TBK1/IRF3 in recipient immune cells decreased under donor antigen stimulation. Combination use of MSC and FK506 can prolong graft survival, possibly by down-regulating TBK1/IRF3 phosphorylation, thus reducing IFN-γ production to prevent infiltration of inflammatory cells in the graft and extend graft survival. The findings provide a potential new approach to immunosuppression selection. 'FK506', 'IFN-γ', 'Mouse heart transplantation', 'TBK1/IRF3', 'mesenchymal stem cells'
