Anesthetic Management of Staged Bilateral Adrenalectomy for Neuroendocrine Tumors in a Heart-Lung Transplant Patient: A Case Report. Neuroendocrine tumors may rarely present after organ transplantation, including cardiac transplant. Treatment is surgical resection with careful perioperative management to optimize blood pressure and intravascular volume. We present the anesthetic management of a patient who was diagnosed with bilateral neuroendocrine tumors soon after heart-lung transplantation and underwent successful staged bilateral adrenalectomy.
