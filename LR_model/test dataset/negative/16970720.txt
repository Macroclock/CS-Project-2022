An unusual cause of pulmonary vein stenosis: a case report and review of the literature. We describe the case of a patient with the Carney syndrome and several resections for recurrent left atrial myxomas who underwent autotransplantation of the heart with resection of the left and right atria and reconstruction of both atria with bovine pericardium. She subsequently presented with severe shortness of breath, ascites, and peripheral edema. She was found to have stenosis of all four pulmonary veins and severe pulmonary hypertension. We describe the echocardiographic findings and review the literature on assessment of acquired pulmonary vein stenosis.
