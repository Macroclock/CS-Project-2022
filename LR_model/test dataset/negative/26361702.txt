Total Artificial Heart Bridge to Transplantation for a Patient With Occult Intracardiac Malignancy: Case Report. Malignancy is the leading cause of long-term morbidity and mortality after heart and other solid organ transplantation; therefore, great emphasis is placed on pre- and post-transplantation cancer screening. Even with meticulous screening during evaluation for heart transplant candidacy, an occult cancer may not be apparent. Here, we share the case of a 51-year-old man with refractory heart failure who underwent total artificial heart implantation as a bridge to transplantation with the surprise finding of an isolated deposit of metastatic carcinoid tumor nested within a left ventricular papillary muscle in his explanted heart. The primary ileal carcinoid tumor was identified and resected completely. After remaining cancer-free for 14 months, he was listed for heart transplantation and was transplanted 2 months later. He is currently 3.5 months out from heart transplantation and doing well, without evidence of recurring malignancy.
