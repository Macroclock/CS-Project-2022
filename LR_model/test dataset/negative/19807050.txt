[Hypertension in solid organ transplants]. Hypertension is highly prevalent in transplantation and affects all type of organs. With the introduction of calcineurin inhibitors as immunosuppressive drugs, acute allograft rejection episodes have been significantly reduced and hence patient and allograft survival rates have dramatically improved. However, cardiovascular complications have become an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Treating cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension seems obvious, however in this population, there is little evidence for specific blood pressure targets, or for the best strategy to achieve blood pressure control. The aim of this article is to review the epidemiology and physiopathology of hypertension in transplant recipients as well as its clinical management.
