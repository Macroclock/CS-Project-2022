Three-Dimensional Right Ventricular Strain Versus Volume Quantification in Heart Transplant Recipients in Relation to Pulmonary Artery Pressure. Residual pulmonary hypertension challenges the right ventricular function and worsens the prognosis in heart transplant recipients. The complex geometry of the right ventricle complicates estimation of its function with conventional transthoracic echocardiography. We evaluated right ventricular function in heart transplant recipients with the use of 3-dimensional echocardiography in relation to systolic pulmonary artery pressure. We performed 32 studies in 26 heart transplant patients, with 6 patients having 2 studies at different time points with different pressures and thus included. Right atrial volume, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, peak systolic annular velocity, fractional area change, and 2-dimensional speckle tracking longitudinal strain were obtained by 2-dimensional and tissue Doppler imaging. Three-dimensional right ventricular volumes, ejection fraction, and 3-dimensional right ventricular strain were obtained from the 3-dimensional data set by echocardiographers. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure was obtained during right heart catheterization. Overall mean systolic pulmonary artery pressure was 26 Â± 7 mm Hg (range, 14-44 mmHg). Three-dimensional end-diastolic (r = 0.75; P < .001) and end-systolic volumes (r = 0.55; P = .001)correlated well with systolic pulmonary artery pressure. Right ventricular ejection fraction and right atrium volume also significantly correlated with systolic pulmonary artery pressure (r = 0.49 and P = .01 for both). However, right ventricular 2- and 3-dimensional strain, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, and tricuspid annular velocity did not. The effects of pulmonary hemodynamic burden on right ventricular function are better estimated by a 3-dimensional volume evaluation than with 3-dimensional longitudinal strain and other 2-dimensional and tissue Doppler measurements. These results suggest that the peculiar anatomy of the right ventricle necessitates 3-dimensional volume quantification in heart transplant recipients in relation to residual pulmonary hypertension.
