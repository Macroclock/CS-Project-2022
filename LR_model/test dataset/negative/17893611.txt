Graft produced interleukin-6 functions as a danger signal and promotes rejection after transplantation. Interleukin (IL)-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that functions in both the innate and adaptive immune responses. However, the role of IL-6 in allograft rejection remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate a critical role for graft-produced IL-6 in allograft rejection in a murine model of cardiac allograft transplantation. The results show that IL-6-deficient grafts transplanted into allogeneic wild-type recipients have significantly prolonged survival, approximately three times the survival time of wild-type controls. In contrast, allogeneic cardiac transplants into IL-6-deficient recipients do not have prolonged graft survival, indicating that donor graft cells are the relevant source of IL-6. Our investigation of potential mechanisms shows that graft-produced IL-6 promotes the activation of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells. Furthermore, we show that IL-6 deficiency prolongs graft survival only in the presence of CD25+ T cells that have a phenotype consistent with regulatory T cells. Interestingly, IL-6 production by the graft is triggered by antigen-independent innate immune mechanisms. Thus, our results suggest the paradigm that graft rejection versus tolerance is determined by a balance between the activation of effector T cells versus immune suppression by regulatory T cells, and that after transplantation, IL-6 functions as a systemic danger signal that overcomes constitutive immune suppression mediated by regulatory T cells and promotes the activation of effector T cells.
