Unloading-induced remodeling in the normal and hypertrophic left ventricle. To date, no study has assessed the degree of similarity between left ventricular (LV) reverse remodeling and atrophic remodeling. Stable LV hypertrophy was induced by creation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in Lewis rats (32 days). LV unloading was induced by heterotopic transplantation of normal (NL-HT) and/or hypertrophic (AVF-HT) hearts (7 days). We compared indexes of remodeling in AVF, NL-HT, and AVF-HT groups with those of normal controls. LV unloading induced decreases in cardiomyocyte size in NL-HT and AVF-HT hearts. NL-HT and AVF-HT LV were both characterized by relative increases in collagen concentration that were largely a reflection of decreases in myocyte volume. NL-HT and AVF-HT LV were associated with similar increases in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2 and -9) zymographic activity, without change in the abundance of the tissue inhibitors of the MMPs. In contrast, AVF-HT, but not NL-HT, was associated with a dramatic increase in collagen cross-linking. Our findings suggest an overall similarity in the response of the normal and hypertrophic LV to surgical unloading. However, the dramatic increase in collagen cross-linking after just 1 wk of unloading suggests a potential difference in the dynamics of collagen metabolism between the two models. Further studies will be required to determine the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for these differences in extracellular matrix regulation. However, with respect to these and related issues, heterotopic transplantation of hypertrophied hearts will be a useful small animal model for defining mechanisms of myocyte-matrix interactions during decreased loading conditions.
