Enhanced allograft survival and modulation of T-cell alloreactivity induced by inhibition of MMP/ADAM enzymatic activity. Recent studies have shown significantly increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and disintegrin-type metalloproteinases (ADAM) during allograft rejection. In this regard, our previous studies have demonstrated contrasting roles for MMP-2 and MMP-9 during allograft rejection: MMP-2-deficiency enhanced allograft survival while MMP-9-deficiency decreased allograft survival. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of broad-spectrum MMP/ADAM inhibition on the pathogenesis of allograft rejection. Toward this, heterotopic BALB/c cardiac allografts were transplanted into C57BL/6 recipients treated with MMP/ADAM inhibitors, GM6001 or doxycycline. Systemic MMP/ADAM inhibition significantly enhanced allograft survival. Functioning allografts recovered from MMP/ADAM inhibitor-treated recipients showed lower cellular infiltration and tissue remodeling than rejected allografts recovered from control recipients. In addition, decreased chemotaxis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells and macrophages was observed in vitro in the presence of MMP/ADAM inhibitors. Enhanced T-cell alloreactivity was also observed ex vivo in MMP/ADAM inhibitor-treated recipients and in vitro in the presence of MMP/ADAM inhibitors. These observations were associated with enhanced cytokine, chemokine and growth factor production. These results indicate that MMPs and ADAMs play a critical role in the pathogenesis of allograft rejection and may represent novel therapeutic targets for the treatment and/or prevention of this disease.
