Donor-specific antibodies: can they predict C4d deposition in pediatric heart recipients? There is limited evidence regarding the utility of circulating DSA in surveillance for AMR of pediatric heart recipients. Our hypothesis is that quantitation of DSA improves their power for predicting a C4d+, an integral component in the current diagnostic criteria of AMR. All pediatric recipients transplanted between 10/2005 and 1/2011 were retrospectively reviewed for DSA determined within 48 h of EMB. C4d+ was defined as >25% endothelial cell staining by immunohistochemical methods. A total of 183 paired DSA-EMB determinations were identified in 60 patients, a median of three paired studies per patient (range: 1-9). DSA were detected in 60 of these determinations. A receiver-operating characteristic plot identified a threshold single-antibody MFI of >6000 that strongly correlated with C4d+ (p < 0.0001) with a high negative predictive value (0.97) and specificity (0.95). The sensitivity and positive predictive values were 0.71 and 0.60, respectively. The predictive power of single-antigen DSA for C4d deposition was improved in pediatric heart recipients using an institution-specific MFI threshold value. In post-transplant care, quantitative DSA should be an essential component in the surveillance for AMR.
