Mycotic pseudo-aneurysm of the ascending thoracic aorta after cardiac transplantation. A large mycotic pseudo-aneurysm of the ascending thoracic aorta was found in a patient with empyema and infectious mediastinitis after an orthotopic heart transplant procedure. The patient underwent surgical resection of the pseudo-aneurysm with patch aortoplasty and was treated with appropriate long-term antibiotic therapy. The patient continues to do well 3 months after surgery. Early surgical intervention combined with pre-operative and prolonged post-operative antibiotic therapy and close follow-up is essential in these patients.
