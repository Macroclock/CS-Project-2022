Mechanical support and medical therapy reverse heart failure in infants and children. Most infants and children implanted with ventricular assist devices (VADs) go on to cardiac transplantation. Recovery of dilated cardiomyopathies with the combination left ventricular decompression with a VAD and treatment with maximal medical therapy has been possible in some adults, and may be more feasible in infants and children. We used pulsatile and continuous flow VADs and the total artificial heart (TAH) as bridges to transplantation or to recovery. Candidates for native heart recovery were treated with maximal medical therapy for congestive heart failure and short-term dobutamine prior to weaning off device support. Since 1997, 28 infants and children, ages 1 month to 16 years, were implanted for durations of 3-107 days (mean 27). Eighteen received left VADs (LVAD), seven biventricular assist devices (BiVADs), and three TAHs. Device-related mortality was 7/28 (25%), leaving 21/28 (75%) surviving to transplantation or weaning from device support and 20/28 (71%) discharged from the hospital and currently surviving for 2 months to 9 years. Ten of 11 transplant recipients (90%) have survived 2 to 9 years. All 10 with recovered hearts are alive and well for 2 months to 5 years. Eight of 12 (67%) LVAD patients with dilated hearts recovered. None of the recovery patients were over 6 years old. Infants and children who have failed inotropic therapy may be treated with an LVAD and medical therapy for congestive heart failure anticipating native heart recovery. A variety of devices have been tried. All small LVADs yielded comparable results. Larger and older children also have a chance of recovery, but our experience with them is too small except to note that they do well with larger devices and transplantation.
