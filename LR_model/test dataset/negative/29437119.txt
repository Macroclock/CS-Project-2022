Transplant-Free Survival and Interventions at 6 Years in the SVR Trial. In the SVR trial (Single Ventricle Reconstruction), 1-year transplant-free survival was better for the Norwood procedure with right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt (RVPAS) compared with a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt in patients with hypoplastic left heart and related syndromes. At 6 years, we compared transplant-free survival and other outcomes between the groups. Medical history was collected annually using medical record review, telephone interviews, and the death index. The cohort included 549 patients randomized and treated in the SVR trial. Transplant-free survival for the RVPAS versus modified Blalock-Taussig shunt groups did not differ at 6 years (64% versus 59%,  By 6 years, the hazards of death or transplant and catheter interventions were not different between the RVPAS versus modified Blalock-Taussig shunt groups. Children assigned to the RVPAS group had 5% higher transplant-free survival, but the difference did not reach statistical significance, and they required more catheter interventions. Both treatment groups have accrued important complications. URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT00115934.
