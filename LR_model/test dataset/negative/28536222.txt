Giant cell myocarditis presenting with acute heart failure. Idiopathic giant cell myocarditis (GCM) is a rare and rapidly progressing form of myocarditis predominantly affecting younger people. We report a case of a 23-year-old athletic patient who presented with features of acute heart failure due to GCM and discuss his management that included a left ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplant. He died immediately following the transplant.We also review the literature on this rare disease, highlighting the advances in the management of the disease including immunosuppressive therapy, ventricular assist devices and heart transplantation.
