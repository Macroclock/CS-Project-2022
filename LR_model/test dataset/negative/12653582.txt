Posttransplant CD30+ (Ki-1) anaplastic large cell lymphoma: a case report and review of the literature. Posttransplant CD30(+) (Ki-1) anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is rare. A review of the literature revealed only 3 such cases. All 3 cases were developed after single-organ transplantation. We describe CD30(+) (Ki-1) ALCL in a dual-organ (liver and heart) transplantation recipient. The patient was a 68-year-old white female who underwent an orthotopic heart transplantation in 1999 and a liver transplantation in 2000. She presented with nausea and was found to have CD30(+) (Ki-1) ALCL by pathologic examination of the gastric antrum biopsy specimen. To our knowledge, this patient represents the first reported case of posttransplant CD30(+) ALCL following a dual-organ transplantation.
