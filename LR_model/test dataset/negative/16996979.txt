Transplantation in truncus arteriosus combined with interrupted aortic arch. We present the case of an infant with truncus arteriosus combined with a dysplastic truncal valve not amenable to repair and interrupted aortic arch. Due to the disappointing results of truncal valve replacement we decided to perform cardiac transplantation. The infant survived transplantation and was discharged 4 weeks after surgery.
