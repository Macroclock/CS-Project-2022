Intrapulmonary ectopic liver after orthotopic heart transplantation. We report a case of a 54-year-old woman who was found to have multiple intrapulmonary nodules detected on imaging 33 months after orthotopic heart transplantation. Needle biopsy of 2 discrete nodules showed benign hepatic tissue, consistent with intrapulmonary foci of ectopic liver. In this report, the clinical, radiologic, microscopic, and fluorescent in situ hybridization results of 2 biopsied nodules are described. A brief review of the published information on ectopic liver is also presented. To our knowledge, multiple ectopic foci of the liver have never been reported at any site. Furthermore, this is the first reported case that involves a transplant recipient, thereby introducing additional, unique ramifications to this rare but intriguing entity.
