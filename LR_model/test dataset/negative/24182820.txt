Efficacy of the cardiac rehabilitation program in patients with end-stage heart failure, heart transplant patients, and left ventricular assist device recipients. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of cardiac rehabilitation on the functional capacity, pulmonary functions, quality of life, and psychological state of patients who had heart failure (HF), heart transplantation (HTx), or a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). An 8-week exercise program was undertaken by 46 patients diagnosed with end-stage heart failure, 40 of whom had a heart transplantation and 11 were implanted with an LVAD. The patients' functionality was assessed with a maximal oxygen consumption test (pVO2), their psychological state with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), their quality of life (QOL) with the Short Form 36 (SF 36), and their pulmonary condition with pulmonary function tests (PFTs). A significant improvement was observed in all forced vital capacity (%), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (%), pVO2, BDI, and most of the subscores of the SF 36 scores at the end of the exercise, compared with the pre-exercise period (P < .05). The intergroup evaluations showed no significant differences among the 3 groups in terms of all assessed changes (P > .05). An 8-week supervised exercise program was observed to improve functional capacity, PFT, QOL, and depression among patients who had HF, HTx, or LVAD. Supervised exercise should be recommended for every patient included in a heart transplant program.
