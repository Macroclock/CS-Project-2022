Marked prolongation of murine cardiac allograft survival using recipient immature dendritic cells loaded with donor-derived apoptotic cells. We investigated whether recipient dendritic cells (DCs), pretreated with nuclear factor-kappaB oligodeoxyribonucleotide decoy (NF-kappaB ODN decoy) and loaded with ultraviolet B-irradiated donor apoptotic splenocytes (Apo-SCs), were able to induce murine cardiac allograft tolerance. Heterotopic vascularized heart transplantation was performed from BALB/c to C57BL/6 mice, and recipients (C57BL/6) were given one injection of recipient DCs pretreated with NF-kappaB ODN decoy and loaded with donor (BALB/c) apoptotic SCs (decoy Apo-SCs DCs) through the portal vein at 7 days, before heart transplantation in the absence of immunosuppression. The cardiac allograft survival time and the expressive levels of intragraft cytokine genes [interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, and interferon-gamma] were evaluated. Our results indicated that injection of decoy Apo-SCs DCs significantly prolonged vascularized heart allograft survival and led to skewing of intragraft cytokine expression towards T helper 2 (IL-10). The mechanisms can be useful for therapy of allograft rejection with minimization of systemic immunosuppression.
