Natural history of a systemic right ventricle. The natural history of a systemic right ventricle after an atrial switch procedure has yet to be fully characterised. We describe the case of the longest surviving patient at our institution who underwent a Mustard Baffle correction for dextro-transposition of great arteries in childhood. Over following decades he was reviewed regularly with deteriorating systemic right ventricle function. At around 50 years of age he developed worsening heart failure on maximal medical therapy. He was subsequently assessed for cardiac transplantation which he underwent successfully at the age of 55 years.
