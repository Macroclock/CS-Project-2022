Machine Learning of 12-Lead QRS Waveforms to Identify Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Patients With Differential Outcomes. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves heart failure outcomes but has significant nonresponse rates, highlighting limitations in ECG selection criteria: QRS duration (QRSd) â‰¥150 ms and subjective labeling of left bundle branch block (LBBB). We explored unsupervised machine learning of ECG waveforms to identify CRT subgroups that may differentiate outcomes beyond QRSd and LBBB. We retrospectively analyzed 946 CRT patients with conduction delay. Principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction obtained a 2-dimensional representation of preCRT 12-lead QRS waveforms.  Compared with QRS PCA Group 2 ( Unsupervised machine learning of ECG waveforms identified CRT subgroups with relevance beyond LBBB and QRSd. This method may assist in objective classification of bundle branch block morphology in CRT.
