[8.5 year-follow-up of combined heart-lung transplantation in a patient]. To summarize the case of combined heart-lung transplantation for a patient who survived for 8.5 years. On September 20, 2003, at Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, homologous heartlung transplantation was performed on a male patient who was diagnosed with cardiopulmonary failure secondary to congenital ventricular septal defect with severe pulmonary hypertension. Heart-lung allograft was preserved with 1500 mL modified St.Thomas solution and 3000 mL modified LPD solution. Postoperative immunosuppressive therapies included: methylprednisolone and human anti-lymphocyte globulin protein in the induction period; and combination of ciclosporin A, CellCept and prednisolone in the stable period. In 2007, the treatment was changed to CellCept mg, twice a day+FK506 4 mg, twice a day. The patient lived 8.5 years of normal life with cardiac function of NYHA I-II. Echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 61% to 74%. Heart-lung transplantation proved reliable therapy modality for terminal cardiopulmonary failure. Excellent donor organ preservation and proper perioperative treatment are key factors for long-term survival after heart-lung transplantation.
