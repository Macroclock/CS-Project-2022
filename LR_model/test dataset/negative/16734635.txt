BK virus nephropathy in a heart transplant recipient: case report and review of the literature. The human polyomavirus BK virus (BKV) remains latent in the urinary tract and may be reactivated in immunocompromised states. BKV is noted to be the etiologic agent of polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), which is a significant cause of allograft failure in renal transplant patients. Renal dysfunction following non-renal solid organ transplantation is common and is typically attributed to drug toxicity or patient comorbidities. In this article we describe a case of PVAN in the native kidneys of a heart transplant recipient and review the literature. Although this is only the fourth case reported, BKV nephropathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of new renal failure following non-kidney solid organ transplantation, as early diagnosis of PVAN is necessary to prevent irreversible renal damage.
