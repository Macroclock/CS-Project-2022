Association of Premature Immune Aging and Cytomegalovirus After Solid Organ Transplant. Immune function is altered with increasing age. Infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) accelerates age-related immunological changes resulting in expanded oligoclonal memory CD8 T cell populations with impaired proliferation, signaling, and cytokine production. As a consequence, elderly CMV seropositive (CMV 'Telomere', 'cytomegalovirus (CMV)', 'flow cytometry', 'immunosenescence', 'transplantation immunobiology'
