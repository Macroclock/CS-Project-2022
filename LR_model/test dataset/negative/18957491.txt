Apicoaortic conduit for the dilated phase of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy as an alternative to heart transplantation. We describe a 16-year-old suffering from the dilated phase of mid-ventricular obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with end-stage heart failure. Her plasma type-B natriuretic peptide level exceeded 8000 pg/ml, and she refused heart transplantation. She underwent an apicoaortic valved conduit as an alternative to the heart transplant procedure. This traditional procedure is still an ideal operation for very sick cardiomyopathy patients to avoid or delay heart transplantation.
