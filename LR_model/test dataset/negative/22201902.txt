Nutritional issues in heart transplant candidates and recipients. Heart transplant is the golden standard in the management of end-stage heart failure. Recent studies have pointed out the role of nutritional issues in patients evaluated for heart transplant listing. In particular, extremes in body habitus, cachexia and obesity, have been characterized and identified as independent prognostic factors and clinically relevant target for therapeutic interventions. Effects of such conditions exert a prognostic implication well beyond waiting time up to early post transplant setting. Changes in posttransplant clinical conditions and nutritional status have been recently described in their pattern of presentation and implications on weight gain, reversal of preoperative cachexia and early and late morbidity and mortality. New onset diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome have been disclosed as relevant clinical conditions in this setting. Implications for tailoring of immunosuppressive therapy and dietary prescription emerged as main stem of long term recipient management. All this issues have been reviewed focusing on the clinical relevance of this growing body of knowledge and emphasizing the role of a multidisciplinary approach for selection and management of heart transplant recipients.
