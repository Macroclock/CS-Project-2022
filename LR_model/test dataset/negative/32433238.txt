BET Protein Inhibition Prolongs Cardiac Transplant Survival via Enhanced Myocardial Autophagy. Graft rejection continues to be a major barrier to long-term engraftment after transplantation. Autophagy plays an important role in cardiac injury pathogenesis. The bromodomain and extraterminal protein inhibitor (S)-tert-butyl2-(4-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,3,9-trimethyl-6H-thieno[3,2-f][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]diazepin-6-yl)acetate (JQ1) inhibits inflammatory responses. However, the beneficial effect of JQ1 on transplant and the potential role of autophagy in the protective effect of graft survival are yet to be investigated. Syngeneic or allogeneic heterotopic heart transplantation was performed using C57BL/6 or BALB/c donors for C57BL/6 recipients through different treatments. Some mice were used to observe the survival of the grafts. The other mice were euthanized on the third, fifth, and seventh days after surgery. The graft samples were taken for cytokines and autophagy pathway analyses. Our study revealed that JQ1 treatment prolonged cardiac allograft survival. JQ1 increased the expression levels of liver kinase beta 1, autophagy-specific gene 5, and microtubule-associated protein light chain3-II (LC3-II) and potentiated the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase, unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1), and autophagy-specific gene 14 in allografts. A conditional autophagy-specific gene 5 deletion donor was utilized to abrogate the effect induced by JQ1. The combined use of JQ1 with bafilomycin A1 partially reversed the effect of JQ1, suggesting that autophagy is involved in the signaling pathway in graft survival. JQ1 downregulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6, interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ, which was abrogated when autophagy was inhibited. JQ1 prolonged cardiac allograft survival by potentiating myocardial autophagy through the liver kinase beta 1-AMP-activated protein kinase-ULK1 signaling pathway and inhibiting the subsequent release of inflammatory cytokines. This result might provide novel insights for extending transplant survival.
