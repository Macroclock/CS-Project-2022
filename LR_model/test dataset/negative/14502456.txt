Viability of the myocardium after twenty-four-hour heart conservation--a preliminary study. Orthotopic heart transplantation following ischemic times beyond four hours is associated with increased risk of early graft failure. The use of modern myocardial preservation strategies could enable safe transplantation after long-term conservation. In this study, we tested a new myocardial protection regime in an experimental model of 24 h storage. Orthotopic heart transplantations (n=15) were performed in a pig model. Donor hearts were flushed with Bretschneider solution, excised, and stored for 24 hours at 4 degrees C. During implantation, controlled reperfusions with substrate-enriched leukocyte-depleted blood cardioplegia were performed after each anastomosis. Blood cardioplegia contained 1 mmol/l of the Na(+)-H(+)-exchange inhibitor HOE 642 and 100 mg/l of adenosine. Controlled reperfusion was continued with leukocyte-depleted blood for 20 min. A microaxial pump was inserted after heart transplantation and circulatory assistance was maintained for five hours to prevent right heart failure. No initial graft failure could be observed. Thirteen hearts could be weaned from extracorporeal circulation. Due to bleeding problems, kidney and lung failure only five hearts could be included in the final analysis. Hemodynamics of these hearts remained stable with epinephrine at 0.1 micro g/kg/min. Myocardial oxygen consumption 20 min after start of reperfusion (5.3+/-2.0 ml/100 g/min) did not differ significantly versus baseline (6.8+/-2.0 ml/100 g/min). Oxygen extraction six hours after heart transplantation was also well preserved compared to baseline (58.0+/-10.2 versus 49.2+/-8.8 %). Histological examination six hours after transplantation using luxol fast blue staining revealed that only 1.0 % of the myocytes were irreversibly damaged. The data indicate full viability of the myocardium after 24 h conservation. The preservation technique described could contribute to the extension of conservation times in heart transplantation and enable transplantation of marginal donor hearts.
