Increasing multiorgan heart transplantation with hepatitis C virus donors in the current-era. The trends and outcomes of multiorgan heart-transplantation (HT) using hepatitis C virus (HCV) donors in the contemporary era are sparsely known. Using UNOS registry, 1322 adult multiorgan-HTs (n = 986 heart-kidney, n = 155 heart-lung, n = 181 heart-liver) between August-2015 and August-2020 were identified, of which 109 were performed using HCV-donors (n = 77 HCV nucleic-acid-amplification testing [NAT] positive irrespective of antibody status [HCV-viremic]; and n = 32 HCV Ab+/NAT-[HCV antibody + nonviremic]). The percentage of HCV-donors used for multiorgan-HT increased from 0% in 2015 to 14% in 2020 (p < 0.001), but there was wide variation across UNOS regions and center volumes. Recipients of multiorgan heart-kidney transplants from HCV-donors (n = 90) and HCV-naïve (HCV Ab-/NAT-) donors (n = 896) had similar 1-year survival using unadjusted and adjusted Cox-proportional hazards-regression models including in propensity-score matched cohorts. Post-HT rates of cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy (5.4% vs 5.8%) and chronic-dialysis (7.3% vs 4.9%) at 1-year were also similar. Use of HCV-donors (HCV-viremic, HCV Ab+ nonviremic) for multiorgan-HT has increased significantly. Encouraging 1-year outcomes in heart-kidney recipients from HCV-donors should support further expansion of heart-kidney transplantation using HCV-donors.
