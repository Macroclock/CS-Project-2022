Significantly higher incidence of skin cancer than other malignancies in patients after heart transplantation. A retrospective cohort study in the Czech Republic. To perform the first study in Czech Republic on heart transplant recipients (HTRs), compare the risks for different types of cancer and provide comprehensive analysis of skin cancer and other types of cancer morbidity from which we would be able to derive an evidence-based skin cancer surveillance program. A retrospective cohort study was performed to determine and compare standardized morbidity ratio (SMR) of different types of cancer developed after heart transplantation. We analysed data obtained from medical documentation of 603 HTRs transplanted between 1993 and 2010. 191 incident cases of malignancy occurred in123 HTRs (20.4%). According to expectations, nonmelanoma skin cancer was the most frequent type of malignancy (119 cases) with SMR 7.6 (P < 0.001), followed by lung cancer with SMR 2.7 (P < 0.001). SMR for melanoma was 2.5, P = 0.129. Other types of cancer in HTRs (prostate and kidney cancer) were less frequent (SMR 2.06, P = 0.038 and SMR 2.03, P = 0.122). The risk of malignancy development is significantly higher for HTRs compared to the general population. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is the most frequent type of cancer followed by basal cell carcinoma. These findings emphasise the importance of regular skin cancer screening in HTRs.
