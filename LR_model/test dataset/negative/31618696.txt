Impact of Obesity on Ventricular Assist Device Outcomes. Obesity remains a relative contraindication for heart transplantation, and hence, obese patients with advanced heart failure receive ventricular assist devices (VADs) either as a destination or "bridge to weight loss" strategy. However, impact of obesity on clinical outcomes after VAD implantation is largely unknown. We sought to determine the clinical outcomes of obese patients with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m The Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) registry was queried for patients who underwent VAD implantation. Patients were categorized into BMI groups based on World Health Organization classification. Of 17,095 patients, 2620 (15%) had a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m Obesity alone should not be considered a contraindication for VAD therapy in contemporary era. Given durability of heart transplantation, strategies should be developed to promote weight loss, which occurs infrequently in obese patients. Impact of weight loss on clinical outcome of obese patients warrants further investigation. 'Ventricular assist device', 'bleeding', 'device malfunction', 'device thrombosis', 'obesity', 'weight loss'
