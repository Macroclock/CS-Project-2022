In vivo function of immune inhibitory molecule B7-H4 in alloimmune responses. B7 ligands deliver both costimulatory and coinhibitory signals to the CD28 family of receptors on T lymphocytes, the balance between which determines the ultimate immune response. Although B7-H4, a recently discovered member of the B7 family, is known to negatively regulate T cell immunity in autoimmunity and cancer, its role in solid organ allograft rejection and tolerance has not been established. Targeting the B7-H4 molecule by a blocking antibody or use of B7-H4(-/-) mice as recipients of fully MHC-mismatched cardiac allografts did not affect graft survival. However, B7-H4 blockade resulted in accelerated allograft rejection in CD28-deficient recipients. B7-1/B7-2-double-deficient recipients are truly independent of CD28/CTLA-4:B7 signals and usually accept MHC-mismatched heart allografts. Blockade of B7-H4 in these mice also precipitated rejection, demonstrating regulatory function of this molecule independent of an intact CD28/CTLA-4:B7 costimulatory pathway. Accelerated allograft rejection was always accompanied by increased frequencies of alloreactive IFN-Î³-, IL-4- and Granzyme B-producing splenocytes. Finally, intact recipient, but not donor, B7-H4 is essential for prolongation of allograft survival by blocking CD28/CTLA4:B7 pathway using CTLA4-Ig. These data are the first to provide evidence of the regulatory effects of B7-H4 in alloimmune responses in a murine model of solid organ transplantation.
