Cardiac allograft vasculopathy and insulin resistance--hope for new therapeutic targets. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a major cause of death in patients surviving more than 1 year after heart transplantation. An important cluster of CAV risk factors occurs as a consequence of insulin resistance and manifests as part of the metabolic syndrome. This article summarizes the pathologic features of CAV and reviews the contribution of the major components of insulin resistance in CAV development and progression. It focuses on the few studies that have analyzed the impact of the individual metabolic abnormalities and inflammation and on therapeutic strategies to minimize the clinical manifestation of insulin resistance after heart transplantation.
