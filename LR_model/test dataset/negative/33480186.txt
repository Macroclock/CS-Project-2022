Complications of left ventricular assist devices causing high urgency status on waiting list: impact on outcome after heart transplantation. Heart transplantation (HTx) represents optimal care for advanced heart failure. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are often needed as a bridge-to-transplant (BTT) therapy to support patients during the wait for a donor organ. Prolonged support increases the risk for LVAD complications that may affect the outcome after HTx. A total of 342 patients undergoing HTx after LVAD as BTT in a 10-year period in two German high-volume HTx centres were retrospectively analysed. While 73 patients were transplanted without LVAD complications and with regular waiting list status (T, n = 73), the remaining 269 patients were transplanted with high urgency status (HU) and further divided with regard to the observed leading LVAD complications (infection: HU1, n = 91; thrombosis: HU2, n = 32; stroke: HU3, n = 38; right heart failure: HU4, n = 41; arrhythmia: HU5, n = 23; bleeding: HU6, n = 18; device malfunction: HU7, n = 26). Postoperative hospitalization was prolonged in patients with LVAD complications. Analyses of perioperative morbidity revealed no differences regarding primary graft dysfunction, renal failure, and neurological events except postoperative infections. Short-term survival, as well as Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, indicated comparable results between the different study groups without disadvantages for patients with LVAD complications. Left ventricular assist device therapy can impair the outcome after HTx. However, the occurrence of LVAD complications may not impact on outcome after HTx. Thus, we cannot support the prioritization or discrimination of HTx candidates according to distinct mechanical circulatory support-associated complications. Future allocation strategies have to respect that device-related complications may define urgency but do not impact on the outcome after HTx.
