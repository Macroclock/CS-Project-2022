Bariatric surgery in severe obesity and end-stage heart failure with mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to successful heart transplantation: a case report. We present the first report of the concurrent use of mechanical circulatory support and bariatric surgery in a morbidly obese patient as a bridge to successful heart transplantation. The concurrent use of mechanical circulatory support and bariatric surgery allowed the patient to lose weight and subsequently to qualify for placement on the heart transplant waiting list. This strategy supports consideration of patients previously deemed unsuitable for heart transplantation owing to morbid obesity. Careful patient selection and strict monitoring of the immunosuppressive regimens are important considerations for a favorable outcome.
