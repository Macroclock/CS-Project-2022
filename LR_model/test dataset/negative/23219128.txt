An unexpected cause of massive hemolysis in percutaneous left ventricular assist device. We present the case of a 24 year-old patient that developed massive hemolysis shortly after percutaneous left ventricular assist device, Impella 2.5, was placed. The hemolysis occurred without device alarm while the device was in the correct position. Further investigation of the device revealed fiber wrapped around the tip of the device, as a culprit. This case emphasizes on the special caution applied during device preparation to minimize the possible adverse events.
