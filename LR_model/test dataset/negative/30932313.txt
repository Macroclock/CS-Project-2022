Comparative pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus in stable pediatric allograft recipients converted from immediate-release tacrolimus to prolonged-release tacrolimus formulation. This study was a Phase II, open-label, multicenter, single-arm, cross-over study comparing the pharmacokinetics (PK) of tacrolimus in stable pediatric kidney, liver, or heart allograft recipients converted from immediate-release tacrolimus (IR-T) to prolonged-release tacrolimus (PR-T). In Days -30 to -1 of screening period, patients received their IR-T-based regimen; during Days 1-7, patients received study IR-T (same dose as screening). On Day 7, the first 24-hours PK profile was taken; patients were then converted to PR-T (1 mg:1 mg), with a second 24-hours PK profile taken on Day 14. The primary end-point was tacrolimus area under the blood concentration-time curve over 24 hours (AUC 'heart transplantation', 'kidney transplantation', 'liver transplantation', 'pediatrics', 'pharmacokinetics', 'tacrolimus'
