Myocardial tissue engineering and regeneration as a therapeutic alternative to transplantation. Ischemic cardiomyopathy leading to congestive heart failure remains the leading source of morbidity and mortality in Western society and medical management of this condition offers only palliative treatment. While allogeneic heart transplantation can both extend and improve the quality of life for patients with end-stage heart failure, this therapeutic option is limited by donor organ shortage. Even after successful transplantation, chronic cardiac rejection in the form of cardiac allograft vasculopathy can severely limit the lifespan of the transplanted organ. Current experimental efforts focus on cellular cardiomyoplasty, myocardial tissue engineering, and myocardial regeneration as alternative approaches to whole organ transplantation. Such strategies may offer novel forms of therapy to patients with end-stage heart failure within the near future.
