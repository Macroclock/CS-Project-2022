[Recurrent bleeding of a duodenal ulcer in a 55-year-old man after heart transplantation]. Duodenal ulcers are most often caused by Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection, followed by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and hypoperfusion. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) occurs in about 1-6.3% of patients with a heart transplant under immunosuppression therapy. Up to 25% of cases of PTLD have gastrointestinal involvement. Due to a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms and pathological entities, the diagnosis can be challenging. We report the case of a 55-year-old man 12 years after receiving a heart transplant being treated with immunosuppressive agents (tacrolimus) who presented with recurrent bleeding from peptic duodeni. Immunohistochemistry revealed a rare Epstein-Barr-virus-associated polymorphic PTLD. Rarely, PTLD can manifest only with isolated lesions of the duodenal bulb. The course was progressive, going from an incidental finding requiring transfusion anemia to a perforation within 1 month. Repeated endoscopic interventions were unsuccessful. After a surgical intervention the patient died in the course of multiple organ failure. Retrospectively, a reduction of immunosuppression in polymorphic PTLD would have been a treatment option.
