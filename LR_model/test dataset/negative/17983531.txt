[Nutritional analysis of 25 heart transplanted patients]. Malnutrition could be very important in patients under surgery. Moreover, the immunosuppressive therapy can cause metabolic and nutritional disorders to the transplanted patients. The aim of this study was to obtain information about the nutritional situation of the cardiac transplanted patients with biochemical and anthropometric parameters. A retrospective descriptive transversal study. We reviewed clinic records of cardiac transplanted patients between 2004 and 2005. Biochemical and anthropometric parameters recorded before surgery, in the intensive care unit and at the hospital discharge. At discharge, there is a decrease of the following parameters: albumin, 68%; creatinine, 68%; proteins, 92%, and body mass index, 64%; whereas one year after discharge an increase of the body mass index was observed (60%). It was observed that 36% of the patients presented high results of triglycerides, after both a month and a year after discharge. The percentage is of 32% of glucose and between 52% and 24% for cholesterol, respectively. In patients submitted to cardiac transplantation, there is a tendency for a damaged nutritional situation, both at discharge and after a year. It is important to point out the need for a nutritional education to decrease possible complications.
