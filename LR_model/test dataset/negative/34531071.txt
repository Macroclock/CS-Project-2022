Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitor-Associated Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis After Orthotopic Heart Transplant in a Prediabetic Patient: A Case Report. Postoperative euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (euDKA) associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor use has been well-documented and carries a Food and Drug Administration recommendation to hold SGLT2 inhibitors 3 to 4 days before a planned surgical procedure. Unfortunately, many surgical procedures, such as orthotopic heart transplant (OHT), are unplanned and unpredictable. With the increasing use of SGLT2 inhibitors in diabetic and non-diabetic heart failure patients, new challenges in patient management and perioperative risk have arisen. We report a case in which SGLT2 inhibitor-associated euDKA complicated the postoperative course of a prediabetic patient who had undergone OHT.
