Temporal trends and outcomes of patients waiting on left ventricular assist devices and inotropes for heart transplantation. We sought to evaluate the trends and outcomes of patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) and inotropes at the time of listing for heart transplantation. Adults with an LVAD implanted and listed with 1A status were identified in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry between 2010 and 2017. Patients were grouped according to the presence or absence of inotropes at the time of listing and transplantation. A total of 2714 patients were included in the study including 664 patients on inotropes at the time of listing, 235 at the time of transplantation, and 118 on inotropes both at listing and at the time of transplantation. Patients on LVAD and inotropes at the time of listing were more frequently supported with a right ventricular assist device (RVAD) (P < .001), had higher risk of death in the waiting list (sub-hazard ratio [SHR] = 1.48, 95% CI 1.14-1.90, P = .002), and were less likely to be transplanted (SHR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.63-0.78, P < .001) compared with those not on inotropes, after adjusting for described confounders. Approximately 1 in 10 LVAD recipients listed as status 1A are on inotropic therapy at the time of heart transplantation. Patients on LVAD and inotropes have worse outcomes in terms of survival and lower rates of transplantation. 'heart transplantation', 'inotropes', 'left ventricular assist devices'
