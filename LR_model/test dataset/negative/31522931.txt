Socio-Economic Disparity is Not Linked to Outcome Following Heart Transplantation in New Zealand. Socio-economic deprivation (SED) is emerging as a risk factor for acute graft rejection (AR) and reduced survival of heart transplant (HT) recipients. The study aim was to evaluate any association between SED status of HT recipients and the development of early AR and long-term survival in New Zealand. This was a retrospective cohort study. Over a 30-year period, 329 HT recipients were identified from the Australian and New Zealand Heart Transplant Registry. All patients were divided into two groups according to the 2013 New Zealand Deprivation Index (NZDep2013) Score. Heart transplant recipients with NZDep2013 scores of 1,030 and above that corresponded to the eighth, ninth and tenth NZDep2013 deciles were allocated to the higher SED group and those with NZDep2013 scores below 1,030 to the lower SED group. The incidence of early AR in the higher SED group was 1.158/person-years and in the lower SED group 1.156/person-years. The crude incidence rate ratio was 1.0 (95% CI: 0.71-1.44; p = 0.9997). The prevalence of early AR in the higher SED group was 1.13/person-years and 1.15/person-years in the lower SED group. The crude prevalence rate ratio was 0.98/person-year (95% CI: 0.68-1.41/person-years; p = 0.468). In the higher SED group, mortality was 5.6/100 person-years (95% CI: 4.3-7.4/100 person-years) and 5.2/100 person-years (95% CI: 4.3-6.3/100 person-years) in the lower SED group. The adjusted mortality rate ratio estimate was 1.2 (95% CI: 0.8-1.7; p = 0.426). The higher and lower SED groups had similar survival (p = 0.196). Socio-economic disparity in New Zealand HT recipients has no negative impact on the development of AR or survival. 'Acute graft rejection', 'Heart transplant', 'Socio-economic deprivation', 'Survival'
