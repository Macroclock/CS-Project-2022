Heart or lung transplant outcomes in HIV-infected recipients. Limited published data exist on outcomes related to heart and/or lung transplantation in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. We conducted a multicenter retrospective study of heart and lung transplantation in HIV-infected patients and describe key transplant- and HIV-related outcomes. We identified 29 HIV-infected thoracic transplant recipients (21 heart, 7 lung, and 1 heart and/or lung) across 14 transplant centers from 2000 through 2016. Compared with an International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation registry cohort, we demonstrated similar 1-, 3-, and 5-year patient and allograft survivals for each organ type with a median follow up of 1,064 (range, 184-3,745) days for heart and 1,540 (range, 116-3,206) days for lung recipients. At 1 year, significant rejection rates were high (62%) for heart transplant recipients (HTRs). Risk factors for rejection were inconclusive, likely because of small numbers, but may be related to cautious early immunosuppression and infrequent use of induction therapy. Pulmonary bacterial infections were high (86%) for lung transplant recipients (LTRs). Median CD4 counts changed from baseline to 1 year from 399 to 411 cells/µl for HTRs and 638 to 280 cells/µl for LTRs. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related events, including infections and malignancies, were rare. Rates of severe renal dysfunction suggest a need to modify nephrotoxic anti-retrovirals and/or immunosuppressants. HIV-infected HTRs and LTRs have similar survival rates to their HIV-uninfected counterparts. Although optimal immunosuppression is not defined, it should be at least as aggressive as that for HIV-uninfected recipients. Such data may help pave the way for the use of hearts and lungs from HIV-infected donors in HIV-infected recipients through HIV Organ Policy Equity Act protocols.
