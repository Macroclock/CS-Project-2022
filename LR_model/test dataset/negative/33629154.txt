The Clinical Prognosis of Presence and Location of Late Gadolinium Enhancement by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: a Single-Center Cohort Study. Increasing data have indicated that late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images is associated with the clinical prognosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Recently, pioneer studies indicated that the location of LGE in CMR images also had potential predictive value for HCM prognosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic value of the location of LGE for HCM. This present cohort study included 557 HCM patients who underwent LGE-CMR imaging, and the LGE location was classified as LGE in interventricular septum only (IVS-LGE) and LGE outside the IVS with or without IVS involvement (other than IVS-LGE). All-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality/cardiac transplantation, and sudden cardiac death (SCD) were evaluated. During a mean follow-up time of 83.0Â±37.8 months, there was a significantly higher all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality/cardiac transplantation, and SCD in patients with other than IVS-LGE than in those with IVS-LGE. Multivariate Cox regression suggested that other than IVS-LGE were one of independent prognostic predictors. Risk reclassification for prognosis showed that there were no differences between the prediction values of the presence of LGE and the location of LGE. The presence and location of LGE in CMR images are equally independent prognostic predictors of HCM, and other than IVS-LGE location is associated with an adverse clinical prognosis.
