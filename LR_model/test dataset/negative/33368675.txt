The impact of depression on heart transplant outcomes: A retrospective single-center cohort study. Depression is prevalent in patients with heart failure and after heart transplant. We identified the prevalence of pre- and post-transplant depression and its association with clinical characteristics and post-transplant outcomes. We reviewed 114 adults transplanted 1/1/2015 to 12/31/2015 and identified patients with pre- and post-transplant depression. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared. Of 114 patients, 35.1% had pre-transplant depression and 26.3% had post-transplant depression. Patients with post-transplant depression within the first year were significantly more likely to have acute rejection (10% vs 0%), longer intensive care unit (11.7 days vs 7.8 days) and hospital stay (31.7 days vs 16.3 days), and discharge to inpatient rehabilitation (26.7% vs 8.3%). Patients with post-transplant depression within the first year had significantly higher 5-year mortality (30% vs 9.5%, p = .009). However, after adjustment for total artificial heart/biventricular assist device, acute rejection, intensive care unit, and hospital length of stay, this relationship was no longer significant (HR 2.11; 95% CI 0.18-25.27; p = .556). Depression is common among heart transplant candidates and recipients. While pre-transplant depression did not impact outcomes, patients with post-transplant depression were more likely to have had a complicated course, suggesting the need for increased vigilance regarding depression in such patients.
