Stenting for persistent left superior vena cava syndrome. Persistent left superior vena cava is a common congenital anomaly. We present angiographic pictures and hemodynamic tracings from a case of superior vena cava syndrome in a patient with this anomaly. The images depict a challenging percutaneous intervention for the amelioration of the hemodynamic problem, made even more interesting as the patient was a recipient of orthotopic heart transplant.
