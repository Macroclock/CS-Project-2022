Chronic cardiac allograft rejection in a rat model disparate for one single class I MHC molecule is associated with indirect recognition by CD4(+) T cells. T-cell mediated immune responses play a critical role in chronic allograft dysfunction. The complex nature of allograft rejection, particularly with respect to the vast repertoire of alloantigens and their mode of recognition by T cells, presents a major challenge for the design of well-controlled studies into the immunobiology of chronic rejection. The purpose of this study was to develop a rat model with restricted antigenic specificity that develops chronic rejection without any immunologic manipulation to study the T-cell response. PVG.1U allogeneic hearts disparate for one single class I antigen, RT.1A(u), were transplanted into PVG.R8 rat recipients. Grafts from PVG.R8 were used as syngeneic controls. Chronic rejection was studied by histological analysis of the grafted hearts at various time points posttransplantation (20-100 days). Donor specific alloreactive response was studied in a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay. All allografts survived more than 90 days and showed extensive evidence of chronic rejection, which was characterized by interstitial fibrosis, vasculitis, and occlusive myointimal thickening. Chronic rejection was evident by day 20 and most extensive by day 100 posttransplantation. In marked contrast, syngeneic grafts remained free of chronic lesions. Lymphocytes harvested from graft recipients showed a more vigorous proliferative response to allogeneic splenocytes as compared with that of lymphocytes from nai;ve animals. The proliferative response was primarily mediated by CD4(+) T cells recognizing the RT1.A(a) molecule via the indirect pathway. A single class I disparity in this model generates chronic rejection associated with potent CD4(+) T-cell responses induced by the indirect recognition pathway. The use of this antigenically restricted model may facilitate the design of well-controlled studies for the characterization of immune mechanisms responsible for chronic rejection.
