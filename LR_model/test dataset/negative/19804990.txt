Pericardial constriction after cardiac transplantation. In this study we present a series of 5 cases that developed constrictive pericarditis after orthotopic heart transplantation. All 5 patients had pericardial effusion of non-infectious etiology in the early post-transplant period. They subsequently presented with heart failure unresponsive to standard medical management. The diagnosis was made by comprehensive echo-Doppler studies. Findings were confirmed at surgical inspection and complete pericardiectomy led to improvement in hemodynamics in 4 patients. One patient had relief from constriction but died of non-cardiac complications. One patient with constriction has been re-listed for transplantation due to intermittent heart block and associated cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Early diagnosis of pericardial constriction after orthotopic heart transplantation requires a high index of clinical suspicion and optimal use of Doppler echocardiography. Early diagnosis and timely surgical pericardiectomy may correct this condition entirely and result in satisfactory long-term results.
