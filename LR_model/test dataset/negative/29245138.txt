Cardiac sarcoidosis presenting as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia with ventricular aneurysms: a case report. A 70-year old Caucasian man with recurrent ventricular tachycardia and progressive biventricular failure attributed to arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia was evaluated for heart transplantation. Cardiac ventriculography revealed an abnormal left ventricle with five saccular aneurysms. Heart transplantation was performed. Pathology of the explanted heart showed multifocal sarcoid granulomas. Replacement fibrosis was widespread in both ventricles and associated with saccular aneurysms. No genetic basis was identified. Thus, the evidence suggested progressive cardiac sarcoidosis caused this patient's unusual condition. 'ARVD', 'Cardiac sarcoidosis', 'Heart transplantation', 'Ventricular aneurysms'
