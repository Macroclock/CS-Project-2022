Twin-to-Twin Heart Transplantation: A Unique Event With a 25-Year Follow-Up. Solid organ transplantation in pediatric patients has been a reality since 1954, when the first kidney transplantation was successfully performed between identical twins. We report the long-term outcomes, with more than 25 years of follow-up, in a patient born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) who received a heart transplant from a dizygotic twin. While we would not wish for this situation to reoccur, we hope that in reporting it, we can add to the discussion surrounding pediatric heart transplantation and the management of HLHS.
