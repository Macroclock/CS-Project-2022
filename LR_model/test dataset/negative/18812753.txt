Acute lung failure during mechanical circulatory support. The use of venoarterial extracorporal membrane oxygenation and ventricular assist-devices in children with end stage heart failure is well established. The use of a bridge-to-bridge strategy leads to excellent survival rates in pediatric patients. We present an adolescent, who acquired acute respiratory failure, due to possible transfusion related lung injury, and who was successfully treated with venovenous extracorporal membrane oxygenation while on ventricular assist-device support.
