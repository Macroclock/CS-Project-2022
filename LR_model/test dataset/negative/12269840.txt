An approach to the treatment of pediatric myocarditis. The newest treatment strategies for pediatric myocarditis have evolved from an understanding of the pathophysiology of myocyte damage. Although the initial stages of viral myocarditis apparently result from the direct cytopathic effects on the atrial and ventricular myocardium, later stages of progressive decompensation result from immune-mediated myocyte destruction common to many forms of myocarditis. Despite advances in the understanding of the role of genetics, immunologic mechanisms, and infectious causes of myocarditis, supportive therapy continues to remain the cornerstone of treatment. Presently, therapies include supportive management with anticongestive agents, antiviral medications, and therapies that attempt to interrupt the immunologic cascade. Clinical studies have yet to provide convincing evidence that the use of immunosuppressants and gamma-globulin favorably alters the outcome for pediatric patients with acute myocarditis. Ventricular assist devices and heart transplantation remain as treatment options for all pediatric patients with severe myocarditis resistant to all other therapies. Although this review will focus on viral myocarditis, the supportive strategies and surgical treatment options apply to most forms of cardiomyopathy.
