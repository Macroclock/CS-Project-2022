Heart transplantation in a case of scimitar syndrome. We present a rare clinical scenario of a patient with tetralogy of Fallot, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and concomitant scimitar syndrome. We created a scimitar vein cuff from a recipient heart, performed its translocation, and subsequently performed heart transplantation. This ingenuity reduces the likelihood of scimitar vein obstruction.
