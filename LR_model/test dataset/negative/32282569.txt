Guillain-Barré syndrome in a heart transplantation recipient. A rare case of a heart transplantation recipient with Guillain-Barré syndrome occurred, which was associated with peripheral nervous system damage. Based on a review of epidemiological research, the symptom development process, and diagnostic tools, the authors highlight the extreme rarity of this postinfectious immune disease. After diagnosis, plasma exchange and immunoregulatory therapy should be performed because they result in rapid recovery. If there is delayed diagnosis and treatment, there is a high risk of disability or death. When patients experience acute limb paralysis as the main symptom, nurse practitioners (NPs) should focus on the patient's history, particularly with regard to infectious agents. Closely monitoring the patient to detect respiratory failure and the need for early respiratory intervention can help the patient to avoid the severe complication of permanent brain injury. For NPs, performance of early differential diagnosis is important, especially among patients who have immunosuppressive dependence after transplantation.
