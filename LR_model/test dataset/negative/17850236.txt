Pharmacodynamic cyclosporine A-monitoring: relation of gene expression in lymphocytes to cyclosporine blood levels in cardiac allograft recipients. Recently, we established a pharmacodynamic assay to monitor immunosuppressive effectiveness of cyclosporine A (CsA) in patients on standard CsA regimen. The aim of the present study was to extend this correlation to reduced CsA regimen and to compare pharmacodynamic and kinetic parameters to allow prediction of rejections and infections. In 53 heart allograft recipients, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-regulated gene expression was quantified at trough (C0) and 2-h post-CsA dose (C2). Gene expression at C2 was calculated relative to C0 (residual gene expression, RGE) or relative to a healthy reference group (absolute gene expression, AGE). RGE correlated with CsA C2-levels in bimodal fashion: above 575 ng/ml correlation was seen with flat regression gradient. Below 575 ng/ml, correlation was excellent with markedly steeper gradient. At C0 in the low-C2 group (<575 ng/ml), AGE remained unchanged, whereas in the high-C2 group (>575 ng/ml) AGE was markedly reduced. In both groups, AGE at C2 was strongly inhibited. In patients contracting infection during follow-up, RGE was lower than in those without infections independent of CsA levels. CsA-monitoring by quantitation of NFAT-regulated gene expression is feasible with standard and reduced CsA regimens. It correlates better with the incidence of infections than measurement of CsA concentrations and might help in avoiding over-immunosuppression.
