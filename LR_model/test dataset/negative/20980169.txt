Health-related quality of life and exercise tolerance in recipients of heart transplants and left ventricular assist devices: a prospective, comparative study. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and physical exercise tolerance in patients after heart transplantation (HTx) or implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). A prospective, comparative design was used to characterize changes over time in HRQoL (SF-36) and exercise tolerance in patients after HTx (n = 54) and during LVAD support (n = 36). Nine LVAD patients were lost for follow-up. The majority of patients in both groups were male (97%); the LVAD cohort tended to be younger (p = 0.06). HRQoL improved significantly in HTx patients in the SF-36 physical (p = 0.02), but not in the psychosocial (p = 0.27) component score during follow-up. In the LVAD group, HRQoL showed improvements for both the SF-36 physical and psychosocial component scores (both p = 0.04). Between-group comparisons revealed better HRQoL for the HTx cohort than the LVAD cohort for 2 of 8 SF-36 subscales. Age-, gender- and body mass index (BMI)-adjusted exercise tolerance (workload; VO(2max)) showed significant improvements for both HTx (p = 0.01) and LVAD (p = 0.01) patients. Adjusted maximum oxygen consumption was higher for HTx patients (p = 0.05) relative to LVAD patients at 8 Â± 1 months after implant. HRQoL and exercise capacity increased in both groups over the time-course of the study. After adjusting for relevant variables, HTx patients showed a higher exercise tolerance compared with the LVAD group during follow-up. Thus, future large-scale intervention studies should emphasize the specific needs of these patient cohorts.
