Implantation of an Atrial Flow Regulator in a Child on Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenator as a Bridge to Heart Transplant: A Case Report. Balloon dilation and stenting of the atrial septum are techniques used to unload left heart cavities in acute or end-stage heart failure in children. However, they carry significant risks such as tamponade or device embolization. We report the first case of a child with an end-stage mitochondrial cardiomyopathy on a venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenator as a bridge to heart transplant where an atrial flow regulator device has been implanted. This case illustrates the feasibility and safety of atrial flow regulator implantation in this setting. This procedure allowed to wean inotropic support while awaiting heart transplantation.
