Medical and Surgical Management of Left Ventricular Assist Device-Associated Intracranial Hemorrhage. Management of left ventricular assist device (LVAD)-associated intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is complicated by the competing concerns of hematoma expansion and the risk of thrombosis. Strategies include reversal or withholding of anticoagulation (AC) and neurosurgical (NSG) interventions. The consequences of these decisions can significantly impact both short- and long-term survival. Currently no guidelines exist. We reviewed medical and NSG practices following LVAD-associated ICH and analyzed outcomes. Retrospective analysis of data collected between 2012-2018 was performed. Survival probability following ICH was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Out of 283 patients, 32 (11%) had 34 ICHs: 16 intraparenchymal (IPH, 47%), 4 subdural (SDH, 12%), and 14 subarachnoid (SAH, 41%). IPH tended to occur sooner (median 138 [IQR 48 - 258] days post-LVAD placement) and be more neurologically devastating (mean GCS 11.4 [4.4]). Antithrombotics were reversed in 27 (79%); 1 thrombotic event occurred while off AC. Following resumption, re-hemorrhage occurred in 7 (25%), a median of 13 days (IQR 8-30) post-ICH. Five underwent NSG intervention and 6 (18%) went on to receive heart transplant. Overall, 30-day mortality was 26% (38% in IPH, 0% in SDH, and 29% in SAH), but rose to 44% at 6 months. ICH is a common post-LVAD complication with high short- and long-term mortality, though ICH subtypes may not be equally devastating. Despite this, some may benefit from neurosurgical intervention and do well following cardiac transplant. Anticoagulation is frequently reversed after ICH. Resumption however should be approached cautiously in patients with LVADs given their possible baseline coagulopathy.
