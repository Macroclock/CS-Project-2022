PPAR-γ signaling and IL-5 inhibition together prevent chronic rejection of MHC Class II-mismatched cardiac grafts. Chronic rejection can prevent long-term survival of organ transplants. Although the beneficial effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ) in reducing graft rejection have been reported, the details of the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, especially in the context of modulating cellular infiltration and preventing vasculopathy and interstitial fibrosis. The therapeutic effects of the PPAR-γ agonist, rosiglitazone, combined with anti-interleukin-5 are explored in a mouse model of MHC Class II-histoincompatible cardiac transplantation. Rosiglitazone treatment alone marginally increased long-term survival and reduced CD8 T-cell infiltration and vasculopathy in the grafts. However, there was no reduction in collagen deposition and interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and eosinophil infiltration were increased. Anti-IL-5 antibody treatment alone reduced eosinophil infiltration and collagen deposition, but had no effect on CD8 T-cell infiltration or vasculopathy. Combined treatment with anti-IL-5 antibody and rosiglitazone prevented graft rejection. Furthermore, rosiglitazone treatment increased adiponectin receptor II expression in grafts and on dendritic cells and T cells in vitro. Graft survival correlated with increased expression in grafts of the inhibitory molecule PD-L1. The findings obtained increase the knowledge on the mode of action of rosiglitazone in promoting the survival of MHC Class II-mismatched cardiac transplants in which the CD8 T cells and eosinophils play key roles. PPAR-γ signaling combined with IL-5 blockade prevents graft rejection.
