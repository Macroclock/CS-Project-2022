Predictors of renal dysfunction at 1 year in heart transplant patients. Renal dysfunction (RD) is one of the most significant long-term complications of heart transplantation (HT). Although RD is generally attributed to a direct effect of calcineurin inhibitors, it is more probable that multiple factors contribute to its development. The aim of this study was to search for predictor variables of RD at 1 year after HT. Three hundred sixteen consecutive HT patients were evaluated. The relationship between RD at 1 year (glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2), and pretransplant and 1-year follow-up variables was analyzed. At 1 year following HT, 181 patients (57%) had a glomerular filtration rate of <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. On multivariate analysis, pretransplant serum creatinine values (odds ratio [OR] 5.106, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.35-11.09, P=0.0001) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (OR 2.04, 95% CI: 1.08-3.83, P=0.027) were significant predictors of RD, and diabetes mellitus was almost significant (OR 1.65, 95% CI: 0.98-2.76, P=0.055). Variables protective against RD were induction therapy with interleukin-2 receptor antagonists versus muromonab-CD3 (OR 0.389, 95% CI: 0.24-0.61, P=0.0001), maintenance treatment with mycophenolate mofetil versus azathioprine (OR 0.42, 95% CI: 0.26-0.68, P=0.0001), and CMV antiviral prophylaxis (OR 0.38, 95% CI: 0.17-0.68, P=0.021). Fifty-seven percent of HT patients had RD at 1 year posttransplant. RD was associated with pretransplant serum creatinine values, CMV infection, and diabetes mellitus. Induction with interleukin-2 receptor antagonists, treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, and antiviral prophylaxis for CMV infection all helped maintain renal function in this cohort of HT patients.
