Eprosartan in the primary prevention of cardiac allograft vascular disease: a double-blind prospectively randomized study using intravascular ultrasound. The angiotensin blocker (ARB) eprosartan (600 mg once daily) and the calcium antagonist diltiazem (90 mg twice daily) were studied in a 24-month prospective, randomized, double-blind trial involving 53 heart transplant patients. The study compared their effects on the development of post-transplant cardiac allograft vasculopathy, a condition that frequently impairs long-term post-transplantation survival and where angiotensin blockers might be expected to play a preventive role. From baseline to month 12, the mean plaque volume increased by 7.7 mm(3) for eprosartan-treated patients and by 34.4 mm(3) for diltiazem-treated patients, but the eprosartan-related trend for reduced myointimal hyperplasia was not statistically significant. The trend in favour of eprosartan for secondary parameters (mean intimal index, vessel volume, lumen volume and coronary flow reserve) also failed to reach significance. The lack of effect might be due to a lower than planned sample size and observation periods due to recruitment difficulties. A larger study is required to confirm these preliminary findings.
