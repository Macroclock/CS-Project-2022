Catheter ablation of recipient-to-donor atrioatrial conduction with Wenckebach-like phenomenon after orthotopic heart transplantation. This report describes a case of atrial tachycardia in the recipient atrium manifested electrocardiographically as typical atrial flutter in the donor atrium due to atrioatrial conduction delay with Wenckebach-like phenomenon at the anastomotic line. Radio-frequency energy application resulted in immediate recipient-to-donor conduction block.
