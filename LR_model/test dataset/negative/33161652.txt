Impella 5.0 supported oncological surgery as bridge to LVAD. We describe the case of a 58-year-old man presenting with myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock, treated with Impella CP which was escalated to an axillary 5.0 due to lack of cardiac recovery. Weaning from Impella 5.0 failed, and the patient was evaluated for heart transplantation (HTx) or left ventricular assist device (LVAD). HTx was excluded because of a rectal adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent colorectal surgery while on Impella. Perioperative course was uneventful. After 61 days of Impella, when the LVAD implantation was scheduled, the patient died due to K. pneumoniae infection.
