Influence of gender and reported alcohol intake on mortality in nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Between 1994-1998, we retrospectively studied a cohort of 396 consecutive patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, mean age 53 +/- 15 years, 74% men. The history of alcohol intake was abstracted from the medical records. During a follow-up period of 42 +/- 26 months, 83 (76% men) patients died and 15 (80% men) underwent cardiac transplantation. Men were younger and more likely to have a history of excessive alcohol intake compared with women. Gender significantly modified the risk of alcohol consumption on mortality. Although alcohol intake increased the mortality risk in women, it was protective toward death in men (hazards ratios for death were 7.3 vs. 0.44). The effect of alcohol intake on outcome was reassessed after classifying the patients into 4 groups: group 1: life-long nondrinkers; group 2: former drinkers; group 3: moderate drinkers; and group 4: heavy drinkers. Similar findings were seen. This study demonstrated that the risk of reported alcohol intake on mortality is related to gender in patients with nonischemic heart failure. Our findings deserve further study, including a larger number of females, as a possible way to improve outcome in such patients.
