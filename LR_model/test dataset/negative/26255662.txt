Quality of Life and Influential Factors in Patients Implanted With a Left Ventricular Assist Device. Improving quality of life (QOL) has become an important goal in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy. We aimed (1) to assess the effect of an implantable LVAD on patients' QOL, (2) to compare LVAD patients' QOL to that of patients in different stages of heart failure (HF), and (3) to identify factors associated with patients' QOL. The QOL of 33 Japanese implantable LVAD patients was assessed using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) and Short-form 8 (SF-8), before and at 3 and 6 months afterwards. After LVAD implantation, QOL significantly improved [MLHFQ, SF-8 physical component score (PCS), SF-8 mental component score (MCS), all P<0.05]. Implanted LVAD patients had a better QOL than extracorporeal LVAD patients (n=33, 32.1±21.9 vs. n=17, 47.6±18.2), and Stage D HF patients (n=32, 51.1±17.3), but the score was comparable to that of patients who had undergone a heart transplant (n=13). In multiple regression analyses, postoperative lower albumin concentration and right ventricular failure were independently associated with poorer PCS. Female sex and postoperative anxiety were 2 of the independent factors for poorer MCS (all P<0.05). Having an implantable LVAD improves patients' QOL, which is better than that of patients with an extracorporeal LVAD. Both clinical and psychological factors are influence QOL after LVAD implantation.
