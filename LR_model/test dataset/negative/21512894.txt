Evaluation of decontamination process of heart valve and artery tissues in European Homograft Bank (EHB): a retrospective study of 1,055 cases. To evaluate the efficiency of decontamination practice in European Homograft Bank (EHB), the data of the cardiovascular tissues received during recent 2 years were retrospectively analysed in this study. After initial assessment, the tissues were incubated in a 3-antibiotics' cocktail at 4Â°C for 20-48 h. The states of contamination were evaluated before and after incubation with the focus on the differences in donor type, tissue type, germ type and incubation time. Amongst 1,055 eligible tissues, 77.2% were hearts and 22.8% were arteries. 82.2% of the tissues were retrieved from the multi-organ donors (MOD), 15.4% from the recipients of heart transplantation (RHT) and 2.4% from the non-heart beating donors (NHBD). The initial contamination rate was 27.4% with a significantly higher incidence in arteries. The RHT tissues had the lowest contamination rate comparing to that of MOD and NHBD. Staphylococcus species was the major source of contamination. After antibiotic incubation, 76.8% of the contaminated tissues were disinfected, which was significantly higher for the hearts than the arteries. The RHT tissues had the highest decontamination rate than that of MOD and NHBD tissues. Propionibacterium acnes was detected in 48.1% of the remaining contaminated cases. The average incubation time of the Propionibacterium-positive tissues was significantly shorter than that of decontaminated tissues. In conclusion, the current decontamination protocol of EHB is sufficient for most of the initially contaminated bacteria, whereas it is inadequate for Propionibacterium acnes. This may be related to the slow-growing nature of this bacterium and thereby the relative shorter antibiotic incubation time.
