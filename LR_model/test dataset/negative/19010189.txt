Effect of hypertension, diabetes, and smoking on development of renal dysfunction after heart transplantation. Renal dysfunction is a serious problem after heart transplantation (HT). The objective of this study was to determine the cardiovascular risk factors associated with medium- to long-term dysfunction after HT. We studied 247 consecutive patients who underwent HT between January 2000 and September 2006 who survived for at least 6 months. We excluded patients receiving combination transplants, those undergoing repeat HT, and pediatric patients undergoing HT. Mean (SD) follow-up was 72 (42) months. We defined renal dysfunction as serum creatinine concentration greater than 1.4 mg/dL during follow-up. Patients were considered to be smokers if they had smoked during the six months before HT, to have hypertension if they required drugs for blood pressure control, and to have diabetes if they required insulin therapy. Statistical tests included the t test and the chi(2) tests. We performed Cox regression analysis using significant or nearly significant values in the univariate analysis. Mean (SD) age of the patients who underwent HT was 52 (10) years, and 217 (87.9%) were men. Renal dysfunction was detected during follow-up in 135 (54.5%) patients. The significant variables at univariate analysis were smoking (61.4% vs. 43.2%; P = .01) and previous renal dysfunction (94.1% vs 52.7%; P = .001). Nearly significant variables were the presence of hypertension before HT (63.8% vs 51.1%; P = .09) and after HT (58.2% vs 44.8%; P = .082). At multivariate analysis, pre-HT smoking and previous renal dysfunction were significant correlates (P = .04 and P = .01, respectively). Renal dysfunction is common after HT. In our analysis, the best predictors were pre-HT dysfunction and smoking. Less important factors were advanced age and post-HT hypertension.
