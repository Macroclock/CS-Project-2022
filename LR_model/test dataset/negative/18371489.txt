Noninvasively determined radial dP/dt is a predictor of mortality in patients with heart failure. The left ventricular (LV) developed pressure is a marker of contractility, associated with a poor prognosis during systolic heart failure. The maximal first derivative or slope of the radial pulse wave (Rad dP/dt) has been proposed as a marker of LV systolic function. This study sought to assess the prognostic value of the baseline dP/dt of the radial pulse in patients with heart failure. The Rad dP/dt was noninvasively measured by applanation tonometry, and its effect on mortality was analyzed by using multivariate Cox regression models. We studied 310 consecutive patients. Mean follow-up was 327 +/- 187 days, and 64 patients died or were transplanted during this period. Death or transplantation was associated with New York Heart Association class III or IV, low systolic or mean blood pressure, low LV ejection fraction, and low Rad dP/dt (634.6 +/- 373.3 vs 730.2 +/- 367.4 mm Hg/s for patients who survived without transplantation, P < .02). A Rad dP/dt <440 mm Hg/s was associated with death or transplantation before and after adjustment for confounding variables (OR [95% CI] 2.19 [1.33-3.58] and 2.88 [1.29-6.38], respectively, P < .01 for both). This relationship was independent of pulse pressure and no significant interaction was found between the Rad dP/dt and the pulse pressure. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the Rad dP/dt, proposed as a noninvasive peripheral marker of LV systolic function, is an independent predictor of death or transplantation in patients with HF regardless of LV ejection fraction.
