Prevalence of iron deficiency in heart and kidney allograft recipients. Functional iron deficiency is characterized by the presence of adequate iron stores as defined by conventional criteria, but insufficient iron mobilization to adequately support erythropoiesis. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of functional iron deficiency in heart and kidney transplant recipients based on data from recent medical records. Using standard laboratory methods obtained during routine checkups, we assessed iron status by determinations of serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, ferritin and total saturation of transferrin (TSAT), as well as complete blood count and creatinine. Iron parameters were available for 62% of heart transplant recipients, but only for 26% of kidney transplant recipients. Absolute iron deficiency was observed in 35% of the heart and 8% of the kidney transplant recipients (P<.001). Functional iron deficiency was present in 4% of the heart and 6% of the kidney transplant recipients. Functional iron deficiency was associated with significantly higher serum ferritin and lower TSAT. In addition, although their hemoglobin values did not differ significantly, heart transplant recipients with absolute iron deficiency showed lower erythrocyte blood counts, were younger, and had a shorter time after transplantation. Iron parameters are assessed infrequently, particularly among kidney transplant recipients. Iron deficiency was present in a considerable group of heart transplant recipients. This population should be carefully screened for possible reversible causes of iron deficiency to slow or to minimize anemia development.
