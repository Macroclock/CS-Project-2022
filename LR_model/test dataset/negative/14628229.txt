[Mechanical circulatory assist devices in acute and chronic heart failure]. The clinical use of mechanical circulatory assist devices as bridge to transplantation has been proved as life-saving therapy in a large population of patients. Learning from the clinical experience the construction of the blood pumps has been markedly improved over the last years. The better outcome of the patients has enabled a broader use of ventricular assist devices. The novel axial pumps are designed for long-term circulatory support. After further reduction of device related complications (first of all thromboembolic events) these systems may provide a future alternative to heart transplantation.
