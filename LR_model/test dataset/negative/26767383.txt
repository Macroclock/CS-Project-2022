Acute Cellular Rejection and C4d Positivity in Heart Transplantation : A Manifestation of Asymptomatic Antibody-Mediated Rejection? The role of routine C4d staining in endomyocardial biopsy specimens is uncertain. The implications of a diagnosis of acute cellular rejection (ACR) with a positive C4d with or without any evidence of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) are unclear. This study sought to evaluate a distinct phenotype of ACR+/C4d+ in AMR- patients. Data on C4d, ACR, and AMR were collected. Donor-specific antibody (DSA), panel-reactive antibody (PRA), flow crossmatch, and data on ACR and AMR episodes were also reviewed. Thirty-five patients were followed. Group I with C4d+ biopsy specimens was compared with group II with C4d- biopsy specimens. ACR greater than 1R was higher in group I compared with group II (50% vs 7.4%; P = .01). Clinical suspicion of AMR, positive retrospective crossmatches, and detection of de novo DSA were also higher in group I. Our result indicate that C4d and ACR positivity in posttransplant patients may be a harbinger of a subclinical form of asymptomatic AMR. 'ACR', 'AMR', 'C4d', 'Cardiac transplant', 'EBM'
