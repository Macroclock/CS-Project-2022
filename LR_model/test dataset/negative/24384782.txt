Acute pulmonary injury with refractory hypoxaemia after implantation of Levitronix CentriMag ventricular assist device: successful treatment with veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Although acute pulmonary injury after cardiopulmonary bypass has been detailed in the literature, it was seldom mentioned in the context of following implantation of a ventricular assist device. We report on a 65-year-old male with end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy who underwent implantation of Levitronix CentriMag (Levitronix, Waltham, MA) for cardiac support and was listed for heart transplantation. Acute pulmonary injury with profound hypoxaemia was noted 6 h after the implantation. Despite optimal medical treatment and maximal ventilator support, refractory hypoxaemia persisted, and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (oxygenator: Affinity-NT; centrifugal pump: BPX-80 Bio-Pump, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was applied for ventilation support. The patient was weaned from the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 4 days later and from the ventilator on the next 2 days. He underwent a successful orthotopic heart transplant after a total of 77 days on Levitronix left ventricular device cardiac support.
