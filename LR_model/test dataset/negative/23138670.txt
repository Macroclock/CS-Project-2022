Role of echocardiography in the ventricular assessment of the transplanted heart versus heart rejection. Heart transplantation is an alternative for individuals with end-stage heart disease. However, episodes of heart rejection (HR) are frequent and increase morbidity and mortality, requiring the use of an accurate non-invasive exam for their diagnosis, since endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is not a complication-free procedure. To compare the parameters obtained by use of Doppler echocardiography in a group of transplanted patients with HR (TX1) and another group of transplanted patients without rejection (TX0), having as reference a control group (CG) and observing the behavior of the left ventricular systo-diastolic function expressed as the myocardial performance index (MPI) METHODS: Transthoracic echocardiographies were performed from January 2006 to January 2008 to prospectively assess 47 patients divided into three groups: CG (36.2%); TX0 (38.3%); and TX1 (25.5%). The MPI was compared between the groups, and data were analyzed by use of Fisher exact test and nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test, both with significance level of 5%. The groups did not differ regarding age, weight, height, and body surface. When compared to GC, TX0 and TX1 showed a change in the left ventricular systo-diastolic function, expressed as an increase in MPI, which was greater in TX1 [0.38 (0.29 - 0.44); 0.47 (0.43 - 0.56); 0.58 (0.52 - 0.74), respectively; p < 0.001]. Echocardiography was a very accurate test to detect changes in the systo-diastolic function of the transplanted heart; however, it did not prove to be reliable to replace BEM in the safe diagnosis of HR.
