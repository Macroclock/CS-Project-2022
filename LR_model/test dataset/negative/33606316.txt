Single-center utilization of donor-derived cell-free DNA testing in the management of heart transplant patients. Gene expression profiling (GEP) and donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) are useful in acute rejection (AR) surveillance in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) patients. We report a single-center experience of combined GEP and dd-cfDNA testing for AR surveillance. GEP and dd-cfDNA are tested together starting at 2 months post-OHT. After 6 months, combined testing was obtained before scheduled endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), and EMB was canceled with a negative dd-cfDNA. This approach was compared to using a GEP-only approach, where EMB was canceled with a negative GEP. We evaluated for frequency of EMB cancellation with dd-cfDNA usage. A total of 153 OHT patients over a 13-month period underwent 495 combined GEP/dd-cfDNA tests. 82.2% of dd-cfDNA tests were below threshold. Above threshold results identified high-risk patients who developed AR. 378 combined tests ≥6 months post-OHT resulted in cancellation of 83.9% EMBs as opposed to 71.2% with GEP surveillance alone. There were 2 acute cellular and 2 antibody-mediated rejection episodes, and no significant AR ≥6 months. Routine dd-cfDNA testing alongside GEP testing yielded a significant reduction in EMB volume by re-classifying GEP (+) patients into a lower risk group, without reduction in AR detection. The addition of dd-cfDNA identified patients at higher risk for AR. 'acute rejection', 'cell-free DNA', 'endomyocardial biopsy'
