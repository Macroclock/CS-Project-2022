Echocardiographic evaluation after pediatric heart transplant in Chile: initial application of a functional protocol with global longitudinal strain. The echocardiographic evaluation of patients after heart transplantation is a useful tool. However, it is still necessary to define an optimal follow-up protocol. To describe the results of the application of a functional echocardiographic protocol in patients being followed after pediatric heart transplantation. Alls patients being followed at our institution after pediatric heart transplantation underwent an echocardiographic examination with a functional protocol that included global longitudinal strain. Contemporaneous endomyocardial biopsy results and hemodynamic data were recorded. 9 patients were evaluated with our echocardiographic functional protocol. Of these patients, only 1 showed systolic left ventricular dysfunction according to classic parameters. However, almost all patients had an abnormal global longitudinal strain. Right ventricular systolic dysfunction was observed in all patients. No epidodes of moderate to severe rejectiom were recorded. No correlation was observed between these parameters and pulmonary artery pressure. Subclinical biventricular systolic dysfunction was observed in the majority of the patients in this study. No association with rejection episodes or pulmonary hypertension was observed, which may be related to the absence of moderate or severe rejection episodes during the study period, and to the small sample size. Long term follow-up of these patients may better define the clinical relevance of our findings.
