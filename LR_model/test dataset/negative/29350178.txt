Use of rifabutin to treat tuberculosis in a cardiac transplant recipient: A case report . Tuberculosis is an important concern following organ transplantation. Unfortunately, several antituberculosis drugs interact with immunosuppressants. This report describes our experience with rifabutin (RBT) in the treatment of acute tuberculosis in a cardiac transplant recipient. A 61-year-old cardiac transplant recipient developed tuberculosis meningitis during treatment of miliary tuberculosis. RBT was given for 27 days concomitantly with cyclosporine (CsA). CsA concentrations at 0 hour (C<sub>0</sub>) decreased within 3 days of starting RBT. The serum concentration-curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC<sub>0-12h</sub>)/dose 7 days after starting RBT therapy decreased by 28%, compared to the values before RBT therapy. The apparent clearance at both 7 and 21 days after starting RBT therapy was 1.4 times higher than before RBT therapy. RBT has fewer drug-drug interactions than rifampin and should be preferentially used for the treatment of tuberculosis in transplant patients treated with CsA. Close monitoring of CsA blood concentration during RBT therapy minimized the risk of under- or over-immunosuppression in a cardiac transplant patient. .
