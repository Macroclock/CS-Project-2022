Self-efficacy, recovery and psychological wellbeing one to five years after heart transplantation: a Swedish cross-sectional study. Self-efficacy refers to a person´s confidence in carrying out treatment-related activities and constitutes the foundation of self-management as well as long-term follow-up after heart transplantation. Exploring the heart recipients´ experiences by means of self-report instruments provides healthcare professionals with valuable information on how to supply self-management support after heart transplantation. The aim was to explore self-efficacy in relation to the self-reported level of recovery and psychological wellbeing, among adult heart recipients, one to 5 years after transplantation. This cross-sectional study includes 79 heart recipients, due for follow-up one to 5 years after transplantation. Three different self-assessment instruments were employed: the self-efficacy for managing chronic disease 6-item scale; the postoperative recovery profile; and the psychological general wellbeing instrument. The reported level of self-efficacy was high (median 8.3, maximum score 10). Significantly higher self-efficacy was seen among those who had returned to work (P = 0.003) and those without pre-transplant mechanical circulatory support (P = 0.033). In total, 65.5% (n = 52) reported being reasonably recovered, while 18.8% (n = 12) were not recovered. The median total psychological general wellbeing score was 108 (P25 = 24, P75 = 117), suggesting overall good psychological wellbeing in the whole group of heart recipients. The heart transplant recipients in our study had an overall high level of self-efficacy. Low self-efficacy was found among those with a low self-reported level of recovery, pre-transplant treatment with mechanical circulatory support or who had not returned to work. This is important information for transplant professionals when helping heart recipients to balance their expectations about recovery.
