Endocarditis 2014: an update. The epidemiology of infective endocarditis is changing due to a number of factors, including more frequent and varied antibiotic use, the emergence of resistant microorganisms, and an increase in the implantation of cardiovascular devices. This review outlines and consolidates the most recent guidelines, including the 2007 and 2010 AHA/ACC guidelines and scientific statements for the prevention and management of infective endocarditis and for the management of cardiovascular device infections. The evidence-based guidelines, including the 2009 HRS consensus document, for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular device-related infections are also reviewed. Only patients with prosthetic valves, patients with prior endocarditis, cardiac transplant patients with a valvulopathy, and certain congenital heart disease patients now require endocarditis prophylaxis. There is an increasing incidence of cardiovascular device-related infections due to the higher frequency of implanted devices and higher morbidity and mortality rates in older patients.
