Klebsiella oxytoca necrotizing fasciitis after orthotopic heart transplant. We report a case of Klebsiella necrotizing fasciitis after heart transplantation. The infection required debridement of discontinuous areas on three extremities as well as on the trunk. Klebsiella sp necrotizing fasciitis is a rare entity and has not been described previously in concert with heart transplantation. Klebsiella cases classically have skip lesions as described herein. Klebsiella oxytoca is a rare cause of necrotizing fasciitis in North America and presents with multifocal infection sites. This along with the patient's blunted immune response after organ transplantation necessitated a high index of suspicion for diagnosis and treatment.
