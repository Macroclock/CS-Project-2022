Transplant Volume Is Associated With Graft Acceptance Threshold and Center Resource Availability. Heart transplant volume varies significantly among centers. We hypothesized that centers where the transplant team routinely accepts organs previously declined by other centers and where operating room availability is unrestricted have higher transplant volumes. We used the potential transplant recipient sequence number in the United Network for Organ Sharing database as a surrogate for graft acceptance threshold and the number of transplantations occurring on weekends and 8 major holidays as a marker of center resource availability. Centers were classified as low-, medium-, or high-volume if the average annual number of transplants were, respectively, <10, 10-30, or >30 over a 10-year period. From July 12, 2006, to December 31, 2015, 19,054 transplants were performed by 142 centers. There were 59 low-volume centers, 69 medium-volume centers, and 14 high-volume centers with median potential transplant recipient sequence numbers for transplanted candidates of 7 (interquartile range 3-11), 7 (5-10), and 15 (7-40), respectively (P = .002). The median proportion of off-hours transplantations performed by medium-volume centers was 28% (25%-31%) compared with 32% (29%-33%) by high-volume centers (P = .009). Five-year survival was equivalent among all centers (P = .053). Transplants for candidates with high sequence numbers and unrestricted operating room availability are associated with increased center volume without sacrificing post-transplantation survival.
