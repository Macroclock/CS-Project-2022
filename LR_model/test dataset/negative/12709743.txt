Late atrioventricular block after heart transplantation. Bradyarrhythmia requiring permanent pacing after heart transplantation remains a common problem. Sinus node dysfunction is the most common indication, and late onset of atrioventricular (AV) block has rarely been reported. We report the case of a patient who developed advanced AV block at 41 months after transplantation. Right bundle branch block with progressive increase of QRS complex duration was noted in serial electrocardiograms. At the time of late AV block development, the patient did not have acute rejection and coronary angiogram was normal. The mechanism of late onset of AV block is unclear, but it may be caused by progressive conduction.
