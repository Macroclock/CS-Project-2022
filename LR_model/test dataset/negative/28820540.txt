Endoscopic Port Access Surgery for Late Orthotopic Cardiac Transplantation Atrioventricular Valve Disease. The study aim was to present details of the perioperative and long-term outcomes of redo-endoscopic port access surgery (REPAS) for late atrioventricular valve disease (AVVD) in orthotopic cardiac transplant (OCT) patients. Between February 2004 and October 2015, REPAS was performed for late AVVD in seven consecutive OCT patients (mean age 57.9 ± 17.2 years; EuroSCORE II 21.2 ± 14.7%) at the authors' institution. The mean OCT-REPAS time interval was 7.8 ± 4.6 years (range: 1.3-13.8 years). NYHA class III or IV symptoms were present in four patients (57%). The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 52.9 ± 3.9%, and surgical indications included severe mitral valve (MV) and tricuspid valve (TV) regurgitation in three patients (44%) and six patients (86%), respectively. Etiological factors included endomyocardial biopsy trauma (n = 6; 86%), degenerative disease (n = 2; 29%), and fungal endocarditis (n = 1; 14%). Procedures performed included MV repair (n = 3; 43%) and TV replacement (n = 3; 43%). There were no sternotomy conversions or revisions for any cause. The mean cardiopulmonary bypass and ischemic times were 178.4 ± 48.6 min and 118.3 ± 39.5 min, respectively. In-hospital morbidities included hospital-acquired pneumonia (n = 2; 29%). There were no wound infections or 30-day mortalities. The mean duration of hospitalization was 18.3 ± 11.0 days. A mean of 29.2 ± 45.6 patient-months (total 204.3 patient-months) was available for long-term clinical and echocardiographic analysis (n = 7; 100% complete). No MV or TV reinterventions were required. NYHA class ≤II was achieved in five patients (71%). No patient presented with residual MV regurgitation greater than grade I. REPAS for late AVVD in OCT patients is a safe and durable procedure with favorable technique-related mortality, in-hospital morbidity, and long-term cardiac-specific outcomes at experienced centers. The present technique provided an attractive benchmark against which emerging percutaneous interventions may be measured, and earlier referral of patients should be considered.
