Abciximab in ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction occurring in a heart transplant recipient and treated with stenting. The authors describe primary coronary intervention consisting of direct stenting after abciximab administration in a case of acute anterior myocardial infarction occurring in a heart transplant recipient with triple-vessel disease. Primary success was obtained and the patient survived to a one-year angiographic follow up which showed persistent coronary patency. This is the first report concerning the use of abciximab in primary stenting for acute myocardial infarction in allograft coronary artery disease.
