Ivabradine: beyond heart rate control. Chronic stable angina pectoris (CSAP) usually occurs in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) that affects one or more large epicardial arteries. It results when myocardial perfusion is insufficient to meet cardiac metabolic demand. Elevated heart rate (HR) is an important factor in the development of myocardial ischemia and angina pectoris. The pharmacologic agents most commonly administered in the treatment of CSAP are beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers (CCBs). However, the use of beta-blockers is limited by poor compliance related to contraindications and comorbidities, especially in elderly patients. Ivabradine is a new selective HR-lowering agent that selectively inhibits the pacemaker current I (f) in the sinus atrial node. In several randomized controlled trials, ivabradine 5-10 mg twice daily has demonstrated equivalent anti-ischemic and anti-anginal activity to beta-blockers and CCBs, with a good safety and tolerability profile. Although ivabradine has been shown not to improve cardiac outcomes in patients with stable CAD and left ventricular systolic dysfunction, it may be used to reduce the incidence of CAD outcomes in a subgroup of patients with HR > or =70 bpm. The aim of this short review is to summarize the use of ivabradine in the treatment of CSAP, and its potential utility in atherosclerosis, primitive and dilatative cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmias, such as postural tachycardia syndrome and inappropriate sinus tachycardia, where exclusive lowering of elevated HR may prove beneficial.
