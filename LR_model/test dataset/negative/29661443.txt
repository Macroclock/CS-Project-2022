Cyclosporine Versus Tacrolimus: Which Calcineurin Inhibitor Has Influence on Cytomegalovirus Infection in Cardiac Transplantation? Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a relevant cause of morbidity and mortality in transplantation patients. Its major incidence is in the first year and viral replication is related to acute rejection, survival reduction, and graft vascular disease. This study aims to evaluate retrospectively whether a high dose of calcineurin inhibitors correlates with CMV-positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR), need for treatment, and death in cardiac transplantation patients. This is a case-control study including patients who underwent transplantation between 2014 and 2016. They were separated into two groups (positive or negative PCR) and evaluated for dosage serum levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus. Patients were classified with adequate dose of immunosuppressant or high dose, and was analyzed that there was any association with those and positive CMV-PCR, need for treatment for CMV, and deaths. For statistical analysis, the Student t test was used for the quantitative variables and the Fisher's Exact Test for qualitative variables. To show CMV-free survival, the Kaplan-Meier curve was used. The level of significance was set at 5%. CMV-positive PCR in the sample was 72% for a total of 50 individuals. Positive PCR correlated with a high dose of calcineurin inhibitors in a statistically significant way (P = .002), as did a high dose of cyclosporine (P = .004); however, a high dose of tacrolimus had no such association (P = .17). When a high dose was assessed with a need for treatment, the chance of needing treatment increased more than eight times (P = .024; odds ratio = 8.25; 95% CI = 1.33 to 51.26), which was different from results found with high-dose tacrolimus (P = 1.0). However, no significant association was found in relation to deaths. Tacrolimus serum levels showed no association with CMV-PCR, which was different from serum cyclosporine, which showed association with CMV-PCR positivity, increasing the need for treatment approximately 8-fold, without association with death.
