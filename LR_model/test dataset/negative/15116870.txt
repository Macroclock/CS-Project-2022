[The use of a "transgastric oblique" transesophageal echocardiographic view to visualize the right ventricular inflow-outflow tract. Clinical applications]. This paper describes the transesophageal echocardiographic "oblique transgastric" view to assess the right ventricular inflow-outflow tract. With this approach it is possible to view the right atrium, tricuspid valve, right ventricular inflow and outflow tracts, and the main pulmonary artery. In 2 clinical cases we evaluated the clinical feasibility of this approach in the diagnostic phase; in 31 patients who underwent cardiac transplantation we examined the advantages of this noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring. An advantage of transgastric view compared with esophageal standard views at 30-60 degrees, is the feasibility to obtain the velocity-time integral of the outflow tract systolic flow to calculate cardiac output by the pulsed Doppler sample volume orientation, which in this view is parallel to pulmonary arterial flow; moreover, it is possible to evaluate pulmonary artery pressures from pulmonary and tricuspid regurgitation.
