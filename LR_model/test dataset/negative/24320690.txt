Interval training does not modulate diastolic function in heart transplant recipients. This study investigates the effect of aerobic interval training on diastolic function at rest and during exercise in stable heart transplant (HTx) recipients. Twenty-three stable HTx recipients (74% males, mean age 50 ± 14.9 years) were recruited to a training programme. Intervention was 8 weeks intensive training or control in a randomized controlled design. At baseline, participants had normal or mild diastolic dysfunction at rest. During exercise, mean E/e' increased from 9.0 (± 2.8) to 12.8 (± 7.7) (p = 0.09), E/A increased from 2.1 (± 0.6) to 2.6 (± 0.7) (p = 0.02), and deceleration time decreased by over 50 ms, all markers of increased filling pressure. There were no correlations between diastolic function and VO 2 peak at baseline. After intervention VO 2 peak increased from 23.9 (± 4.5) to 28.3(± 6) ml/kg/min in the training group (difference between groups p = 0.0018). No consistent pattern of improvement in diastolic function at rest or during exercise was seen. The study does not support a role of diastolic dysfunction in the limited exercise capacity of HTx recipients and suggests that in these patients peripheral factors are of greater importance.
