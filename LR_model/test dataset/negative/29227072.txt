The Present Situation and Clinical Topics of Ventricular Assist Device and Heart Transplantation in Japan. Surgical treatment for heart failure includes coronary artery bypass grafting to ischemic heart
disease, valvular disease surgery such as mitral valvuloplasty, left ventricular restoration, ventricular
assist device (VAD), and heart transplantation. In addition, HeartSheet which is regenerative medicine
using autologous skeletal myoblast sheets has been started from the spring of 2016. Formal insurance
reimbursement of implantable LVAD was obtained in April 2011, and the life prognosis of patients
with severe heart failure improved markedly. However, the indication for implantable LVAD is limited
to bridge use for heart transplantation. Implantable LVAD cannot be implanted in patients over 65
years old under health insurance because the adaptive age of heart transplantation in Japan is under 65
years old. It is a problem that the indication of implantable LVAD is identical to that of heart
transplantation. Clinical trial of destination therapy is in progress for the purpose of optimizing the
implantable LVAD indication. I strongly pray that VAD treatment including destination therapy (DT)
and transplant medical treatment based on good intentions will be accepted socially as general
treatment.
