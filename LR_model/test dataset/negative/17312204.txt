The hemostatic history of a 15-month-old child implanted with a Berlin heart left ventricular assist device. We documented the hemostatic changes associated with placement of a EXCOR Berlin Heart left ventricular assist device in a 15-month-old child before heart transplantation. The development of hypercoagulability was rapid, manifested first by a plasmatic and subsequently platelet-mediated increase in coagulation kinetics and strength that persisted for weeks. The patient had no thrombotic complications for 6 wk before transplant but required extraordinary blood product administration to achieve hemostasis secondary to aggressive, multimodal anticoagulation. In summary, when proscribing anesthetic and surgical management of patients with a Berlin Heart, consideration of hypercoagulable features and anticoagulant therapy must be made to maximize patient safety.
