Frequency of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonizations/infections in lung transplant recipients. Lower respiratory tract infections remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality after solid organ transplantation. The particularly increased susceptibility to infection is an especial problem in the early posttransplant period at the initial stage of immunosuppression, owing to direct contact with the hospital environment by mechanical ventilation, biopsies, injections, bronchoscopy, and bladder and vessel catheterizations exacerbated by the impaired clearance mechanisms after denervation of the transplanted lung. Airway colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is common in lung transplant (LT) recipients. Therefore, we performed a retrospective analysis to address the frequency of P aeruginosa infections in our Center. From January 2004 to December 2008, we performed 33 LT, including 4 heart-lung, 6 double, and 23 single lung transplantations. Respiratory samples were the main diagnostic material undergoing routine microbiological methods. P aeruginosa was isolated from 13 patients (39.4% of all 33 LT). In 10 cases (30.3%), we observed airway colonization together with lower respiratory tract infections. From 2005 to 2008, P aeruginosa was diagnosed in about 50% of LT patients each year: in 2005, 33.3%; 2006, 57.1%; 2007, 42.9%; and 2008, 40%. LT recipients in our center are at high risk for pseudomonal airway colonisation and lower respiratory tract infection that may have a significant impact on posttransplant follow-up.
