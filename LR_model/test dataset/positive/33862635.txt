Impact of Reported Donor Ejection Fraction on Outcome after Heart Transplantation.  The global shortage of donor organs has urged transplanting units to extend donor selection criteria, for example, impaired left ventricular function (LVF), leading to the use of marginal donor hearts. We retrospectively analyzed our patients after orthotopic heart transplantation (oHTX) with a focus on the clinical outcome depending on donor LVF.  Donor reports, intraoperative, echocardiographic, and clinical follow-up data of patients undergoing oHTX at a single-center between September 2010 and June 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Recipients were divided into two groups based on donor left ventricular ejection fraction (dLVEF): impaired dLVEF (group I; dLVEF ≤ 50%;   There was no difference in 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year survival. However, the duration of in-hospital stay was statistically longer in group I than in group N (N: 40.9 ± 28.3 days vs. I: 55.9 ± 39.4 days,   Impaired dLVEF is associated with prolonged posttransplant recovery and slightly increased morbidity but has no significant impact on survival up to 1 year posttransplant.
