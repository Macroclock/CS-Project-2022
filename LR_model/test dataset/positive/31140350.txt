Resource Utilization for Prenatally Diagnosed Single-Ventricle Cardiac Defects: A Philadelphia Fetus-to-Fontan Cohort Study. Background Healthcare resource utilization is substantial for single-ventricle cardiac defects ( SVCD ), with effort commencing at time of fetal diagnosis through staged surgical palliation. We sought to characterize and identify variables that influence resource utilization for SVCD from fetal diagnosis through death, completed staged palliation, or cardiac transplant. Methods and Results Patients with a prenatal diagnosis of SVCD at our institution from 2004 to 2011 were screened. Patients delivered with intent to treat who received cardiac care exclusively at our institution were included. Primary end points included the total days hospitalized and the numbers of echocardiograms and cardiac catheterizations. Subanalysis was performed on survivors of completed staged palliation on the basis of Norwood operation, dominant ventricular morphology, and additional risk factors. Of 202 patients born with intent to treat, 136 patients survived to 6 months after completed staged palliation. The median number of days hospitalized per patient-year was 25.1 days, and the median numbers of echocardiograms and catheterizations per patient-year were 7.2 and 0.7, respectively. Mortality is associated with increased resource utilization. Survivors had a cumulative length of stay of 57 days and underwent a median of 21 echocardiograms and 2 catheterizations through staged palliation. Right-ventricle-dominant lesions requiring Norwood operation are associated with increased resource utilization among survivors of staged palliation. Conclusions For fetuses with SVCD , those with dominant right-ventricular morphology requiring Norwood operation demand increased resource utilization regardless of mortality. Our findings provide insight into care for SVCD , facilitate precise prenatal counseling, and provide information about the resources utilized to successfully manage SVCD .
