Relation of Vasoplegia in the Absence of Primary Graft Dysfunction to Mortality Following Cardiac Transplantation. Vasoplegia following cardiac transplantation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have not accounted for primary graft dysfunction (PGD). The definition of vasoplegia is based on pressor requirement at 48 hours, many PGD parameters may have normalized after the initial 24 hours on inotropes. We surmised that the purported negative effects of vasoplegia following transplantation may in part be driven by PGD. We reviewed 240 consecutive adult cardiac transplants at our center between 2012 and 2016. The severity of vasoplegia was evaluated as a risk factor for 1-year survival, and the analysis was repeated for the subgroup of 177 patients who did not develop PGD. Overall, 63 (26%) of patients developed mild, moderate, or severe PGD. In those without PGD, vasoplegia was associated with length of stay but not with short- or long-term mortality. Moderate and/or severe vasoplegia occurred in 35 (15%) patients and was associated with higher short-term mortality, length of stay, and PGD.
