Changes in Pulmonary Function in Patients With Advanced Heart Failure Listed for Heart Transplantation. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are often impaired in patients with advanced heart failure. There is limited data about their impact on survival after heart transplantation (HT). We sought to assess the prevalence and type of PFT abnormalities in patients on HT waiting list and their impact on outcomes. We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospective registry of consecutive patients undergoing HT between 2012 and 2018. Patients were classified into 4 groups according to pre-HT PFT results: 1. normal pattern: forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥ 80% and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV Among 123 patients who underwent HT, 83 patients with complete PFT were included. Median follow-up was 2.7 ± 1.9 years. Of these, 29 (34.9%) had an obstructive pattern, 20 (24.1%) a nonobstructive, 18 (21.7%) a restrictive, and 16 (19.3%) a normal pattern. Fifty-one (61.4%) patients had FEV PFT alterations have a very high prevalence on HT waiting list patients. Patients with impaired FEV
