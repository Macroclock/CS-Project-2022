Comparison of Renal Outcomes in Patients With Left Ventricular Assist Device and Heart Transplantation. Renal function is a major consideration for orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) and left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy. We compared serial changes in renal function and outcomes between patients who underwent OHT and LVAD therapy over 12 months. Forty-five and 58 consecutive patients who underwent LVAD implantation (all bridge to transplant or candidacy) and OHT from April 2014 to November 2016 were included. Six of these patients were in both LVAD and OHT cohorts. Survival analysis was calculated using Kaplan Meier and log rank methods. Univariate analysis of data was performed using χ Renal function had a biphasic course among the LVAD cohort, increasing at 30 days but reducing at 6 and 12 months. Meanwhile, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was seen to progressively decline among OHT recipients. Altogether, eGFR was significantly higher at 6 and 12 months among the LVAD cohort compared to OHT (68.3 vs 59.4, P = .046; 68.3 vs 50.4, P = .015). Compared to the baseline average, eGFR had risen among the LVAD patients (P = .031) but had decreased among the OHT group (P < .001) at 12 months. No significant difference in survival was seen at 1 year (84.4% vs 81.0%; P = .540) and 2 years (78.3% vs 78.8%, P = .687) between the cohorts. Despite poorer baseline renal function, LVAD therapy was associated with comparable survival and better renal outcomes compared to OHT at 12 months. Renal impairment may favor the use of LVAD therapy over OHT in the short term.
