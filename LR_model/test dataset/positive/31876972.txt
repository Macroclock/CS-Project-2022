Clinical outcome of donor heart with prolonged cold ischemic time: A single-center study. Due to the shortage of donor pool, there has been a need for organs with prolonged cold ischemic time. This study aims to evaluate the short-term results of different cold ischemic times in orthotopic heart transplantation based on a single-center experience in China. We retrospectively analyzed outcomes of the heart transplant patients from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017. The recipient population was divided into four groups. Group 1: cold ischemic time greater than 8 hours; group 2: the cold ischemic time between 6 and 8 hours; group 3: the cold ischemic time between 4 and 6 hours; and group 4: cold ischemic time less than 4 hours. Efficacy indicators included after transplant survival, infection rate, rejection rate, and complications. The four groups have similar donor and recipient baseline characteristics (P > .05). Cold ischemic time greater than 8 hours had more cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (127.62 ± 50.23 minutes; P = .003), CPB-assist time (86.14 ± 36.74 minutes; P = .047), and higher intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) usage rate postoperatively (47.36%; P = .010). Cold ischemic time greater than 8 hours witnessed a relatively higher mortality rate compared with the other three groups (P = .115, P =  .078, and P =  .114) during the 2-year follow-up. Survival rates of 1 and 2 years for the four groups were 78.95%, 87.13%, 87.32%, and 87.50% and 68.42%, 85.14%, 85.92%, and 83.93%, respectively. Cold ischemic time less than 8 hours can be reasonably applied to expand the heart transplantation donor pool. Cold ischemic time greater than 8 hours might result in longer CPB time, CPB-assist time, and higher IABP usage postoperatively. It might also affect the in-hospital and 2-years survival rate.
