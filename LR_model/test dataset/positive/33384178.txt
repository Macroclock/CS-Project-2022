Heart Transplantation for Giant Cell Myocarditis: A Case Series. Giant cell myocarditis (GCM) has a poor prognosis without heart transplant, but post-transplant survival is unknown. To describe the post-transplant survival of patients with GCM at a large transplant center. Seven patients underwent heart transplant for histologically confirmed GCM of the explanted heart. The median age was 59 years, and 43% (3 of 7) were female. All patients had cardiogenic shock, multiorgan failure, elevated troponin, and recurrent ventricular tachycardia, and some required mechanical circulatory support. All patients received rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) in the perioperative period at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg daily for 1 to 5 days and 4 received intravenous immunoglobulin 1 g/kg daily for 2 days after rATG. All patients had early initiation of tacrolimus by first to third postoperative day depending on renal function, early mycophenolate, and high dose steroid. All were maintained using tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone. One patient had asymptomatic recurrence of GCM at 3 months, managed by up-titration of tacrolimus, and had asymptomatic 2R cellular rejection at 4 months, managed with steroid bolus. No patient had high-grade rejection. One patient died at 267 days, possibly of GCM. Six of 7 (86%) remain alive at a median of 842 days (2.3 years) post transplant. Patients with GCM have excellent post-transplant survival with use of rATG and triple drug immunosuppressive therapy; however, some patients remain at risk for GCM recurrence after transplant, which may respond to augmented immunosuppression.
