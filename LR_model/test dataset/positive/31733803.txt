Impact of Donor Origin on Survival After Orthotopic HeartÂ Transplantation. Heart transplantation is the definitive management for select patients with end-stage heart failure. Owing to an ongoing organ donor shortage, organs are sometimes allocated from distant locales. These organs may be perceived as less desirable because of donor risk factors and ischemic times. We compared survival after heart transplantation by donors originating from British Columbia (BC), other Canadian provinces, and the United States. This retrospective cohort analysis included all patients transplanted in BC between December 1, 1988, and October 21, 2014, and excluded those with missing data or retransplantation. Among 382 patients, 297 (77.7%) recipients and 238 (62.3%) donors were male. The median recipient age was 54.6 years (interquartile range, 46.0-61.0 years) and the median donor age was 33 years (interquartile range, 22-46 years). Overall 10-year survival was 62.1% (95% confidence interval, 56.3-67.4). There was no difference in 10-year survival when comparing donors from BC, other Canadian provinces, and the United States despite significantly lower median ischemic times in donors from BC. Donor location was not predictive of mortality after controlling for recipient age, donor age, and cold ischemic time. Donor origin did not impact 10-year survival after heart transplantation despite increased ischemic time, suggesting that distant donors result in similar outcomes in BC.
