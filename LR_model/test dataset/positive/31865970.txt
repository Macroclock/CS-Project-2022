Ambient Air Pollution and Mortality After Cardiac Transplantation. Heart transplant recipients are at high risk for mortality, with traditional risk scores performing modestly in predicting post-transplant survival, underscoring the importance of as yet unidentified factors in determining prognosis. In this analysis, the association between PM This study sought to study the association between PM On the basis of the zip code of residence, mortality data in patients who underwent heart transplantation (2004 to 2015) in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database were linked with validated estimates of fine particulate matter concentrations (particles with diameter <2.5 μm [PM A total of 21,800 patients with 86,713 patient-years of follow-up was included. Mean age at transplantation was 52.6 ± 12.6 years, 75% were male, 69% were white, and 39% had ischemic etiology of heart failure. Mean annual exposure to PM This study provides evidence linking air pollution with mortality after heart transplantation. These results suggest an important influence of a key environmental factor in outcomes following heart transplantation, and supports the need for further studies in this population.
