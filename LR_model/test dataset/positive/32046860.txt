Transplantation in Congenital Heart Disease: A Challenge. Heart failure is the leading cause of death in grown-up congenital heart disease patients (GUCH). Although heart transplantation (OHT) remains the gold standard in end-stage heart failure, the ratio of GUCH patients undergoing this procedure remains low. Describe the cohort of GUCH patients undergoing heart transplantation at a third-level hospital. A retrospective review of GUCH patients undergoing OHT between 1997 and 2019 was conducted at a single tertiary university hospital. We included different preoperative (demographic and clinical data, cardiac catheterization data from the last routine hemodynamic monitoring) and postoperative variables (complications, survival). Fourteen patients were enrolled. The median age was 25.5 years (range, 20.7-32.2). Eight patients (57.1%) were male. The median preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction was 37% (range, 22.5%-55%). As for preoperative hemodynamic evaluation, the median for the mean arterial pulmonary pressure was 19 mm Hg (range, 12-22.5), for the capillary wedge pressure was 16 mm Hg (range, 13.5-19.5), and for pulmonary vascular resistance was 1.83 Wood units (range, 1-4). After OHT, 6 patients (42.9%) suffered an infection, the most common of which was respiratory (3 out of 6). Four patients (28.6%) needed renal replacement therapy, and 4 patients (28.6%) presented liver failure. Four patients (28.6%) developed graft failure, thus requiring mechanical support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during a median of 6 days (range, 1-17.5). Survival rate of patients under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was 50%, and overall survival rate was 78.6%. OHT represents a good option for GUCH patients, with good overall survival rates.
