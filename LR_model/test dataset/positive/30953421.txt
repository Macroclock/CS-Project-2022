Clinical utility of surveillance and clinically prompted right heart catheterization in patients listed for heart transplantation. The 2016 ISHLT guidelines recommend that patients listed for orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) undergo periodic surveillance right heart catheterization (RHC) to re-assess hemodynamics (Class I, level of evidence C). However, the impact of RHC on management remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the utility of both surveillance and clinically prompted RHCs in patients listed for OHT. A retrospective study was conducted in adult patients listed for OHT at our hospital from 2006 through 2014. Each patient included had at least one RHC after being listed for OHT. The primary outcome was management change: hospitalization, surgery (OHT or mechanical circulatory support [MCS]), change in United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) status, or initiation/modification of vasoactive drugs, diuretics or neurohormonal blockade. Of the 194 patients included, 85 (43%) patients had more than one RHC. The median time between listing and transplantation was 115â€‰days. Of the 376 RHCs performed, 187 (50%) were prompted by a clinical change; 189 (50%) were performed for surveillance. In 90.4% of clinically prompted RHCs and 42.9% of surveillance RHCs, a clinically important management change was implemented. Initiation/modification of vasoactive drugs, placement of MCS and/or change in UNOS transplant status occurred in 61 (33%) of the clinically prompted RHCs and 26 (14%) of the surveillance RHCs. Patients who underwent management change were more likely to receive a heart transplant (HR 1.58; CI 1.15-2.18) without an increased rate of death over the study period compared to those who did not have a management change. Multivariable analysis revealed that a hemoglobin level <12.2 g/dL (OR 2.96; CI 1.36-6.42) and a total bilirubin level >0.9 mg/dL (OR 5.07; CI 2.09-12.3) were predictors of management change. In patients awaiting OHT, RHCs prompted by clinical instability or routine surveillance resulted in frequent management changes, including earlier heart transplant and MCS implant. Our study supports the Class I recommendation to perform surveillance RHC in patients listed for OHT and suggests that centers should consider maintaining a low threshold for repeat RHC during the formal waiting time.
