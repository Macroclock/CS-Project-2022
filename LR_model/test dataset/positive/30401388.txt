Oxygen Consumption at Anaerobic Threshold Predicts Cardiac Events After Heart Transplantation. The ventilatory efficiency and functional capacity measured by the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) have been used as important prognostic variables in congestive heart failure. This study sought to identify whether these predictors before heart transplantation (HTX) play a key role in predicting adverse events in patients with heart failure after HTX. This was a retrospective cohort study design. HTX recipients were included for analysis. Ventilation to carbon dioxide production slope (VE/VCO A total of 87 patients after HTX were included. Mean (SD) age was 48 (11) years and 73 were male; 28 subjects suffered from events, and 76 cardiac events were recorded. The mean (SD) data of peak VO Aerobic capacity may better predict 2-year cardiac events in patients after HTX. Strategies to improve aerobic capacity should be focused on in the cohort.
