Heart Transplant and Hepato-Renal Dysfunction: The Model of End-Stage Liver Disease Excluding International Normalized Ratio as a Predictor of Postoperative Outcomes. Preoperative liver and renal dysfunction remain surgical risk factors for both postoperative morbidity and mortality. The Model of End-Stage Liver Disease Excluding INR (international normalized ratio), or MELD-XI, score calculation may help as a predictor in patients with advanced heart failure. We analyzed the impact of progressive elevated MELD-XI values among recipients of heart transplant at our institution. The data of a total of 425 consecutive adult patients who underwent heart transplantation, between January 2000 and August 2018, have been reviewed and divided into 3 cohorts according to preoperative MELD-XI calculations (MELD-XI < 11; MELD-XI 11-18; and MELD-XI > 18). Early and late outcomes have been analyzed. Patients with a MELD-XI score > 18 had a more critical clinical condition preoperatively and had a higher risk of early mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.45 [1.11-1.67], P < .001). They showed high risk for postoperative dialysis (HR 2.8 [1.5-5.3], P < .001), rethoracothomy for bleeding (HR 2.1 [1.2-4.1], P = .001), prolonged time of mechanical ventilation, time of intensive care unit stay (HR 2.2 [1.3-3.8], P = .005), and graft failure requiring mechanical circulatory support (HR 1.9 [1.1-3.3], P = .003). After risk adjustment per MELD-XI cohort, ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, redo operation, and cold ischemic time > 240 minutes resulted in being the strongest predictors of early mortality (P < .001). The 5-year and 10-year survival for MELD-XI > 18 cohort was 63% and 47% vs 72% and 59% in the control group (MELD-XI < 18) (log-rank, P < .001). Patients with an elevated preoperative MELD-XI profile presented more comorbidities and significantly lower survival. This suggests the MELD-XI score may provide further insight into appropriate recipient and eventual donor selection. Renal insufficiency and congestive hepatopathy should be properly optimized before heart transplantation.
