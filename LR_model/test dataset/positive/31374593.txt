Discrepancies in access and institutional risk tolerance in heart transplantation: A national open cohort study. The impact of center volume on heart transplantation is widely recognized and serves as a benchmark for certification and reimbursement. Study sociodemographic variables associated with access to high-volume centers and substantiate the importance of extending access to underserved populations. This study focused on adults undergoing heart transplantation between 2006 and 2015. Centers were clustered into terciles (>25, 14-25, or <14 transplants per year) and factors associated with receiving care in different terciles were identified through multinomial regression. During the study period, 18 725 patients were transplanted at 145 centers. Younger age (<30 years) (P = .005), lower educational level (P < .001), and government-based insurance (P < .001) were associated to lower odds of receiving care at a high-volume center. These centers had higher risk recipients and accepted organs from higher risk donors, when compared to intermediate- and low-volume centers. Receiving care at high (odds ratio [OR], 1.212; P = .017) and intermediate-volume centers (OR, 1.304; P = .001) was associated with greater odds of 1-year survival when compared with low-volume centers. Social, demographic, and geographic factors affect access to high- and intermediate-volume centers. High-volume centers tolerate more risk while providing excellent survival. Awareness of this impact should prompt an extension of access to care for underserved patient populations. 'cardiovascular research', 'transplant'
