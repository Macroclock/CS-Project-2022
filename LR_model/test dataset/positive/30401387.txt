Outcomes of Heart Transplant Recipients With Preexisting Malignancies. Ensuring careful selection of heart transplant recipients with pretransplant malignancies (PTM) has been suggested in several retrospective studies. However, cancer survival rates continue to increase and we still lack outcomes data on PTM patients who have undergone heart transplantation (HT) within the Asian region. Herein we report pretransplant characteristics and outcomes among PTM patients with HT. A total of 354 patients underwent HT from January 2004 to January 2016. Eight of these patients had a history malignancy that was being treated before transplantation. Posttransplant outcomes and clinical characteristics were collected and possible prognostic factors analyzed. The median age of the patients with a preexisting malignancy was 60 years. The PTM group included 5 males and 3 females, with a median duration of follow-up of 43 months. In this group there were 2 patients with lymphoma after chemotherapy, 1 with colon cancer postoperatively, and 1 was on chemotherapy. In the other 4 patients, nasopharyngeal cancer, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, and endometrial cancer were identified, and each had undergone treatment. Only 1 premalignancy patient, with nasopharyngeal cancer, had disease recurrence. The 5-year overall survival of these patients was 50.0 ± 17.7%, but 5-year survival for those without PTM was 68.7 ± 2.0%. PTM was 2.3% in our cohort. PTM is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Thus, our findings suggest careful consideration when selecting PTM patients for HT.
