Description and analysis of patients and outcomes following third-time heart transplantation: An analysis of the United Network for Organ Sharing database from 1985 to 2017. Following second heart transplantation (HTx), some patients experience graft failure and require third-time heart transplantation. Little data exist to guide decision-making with regard to repeat retransplantation in older patients. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of patients receiving a third HTx, as identified in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database from 1985 to 2017. The study cohort consisted of N = 60 patients, with an average age of 29 with a standard deviation of ±18 years. Overall survival for the cohort at 1, 5, and 10 years is 83%, 64%, and 44%, respectively. The rate of third-time HTxs has steadily increased in all age groups. Patients older than 50 years now account for 18.3% of all third-time HTxs. Although this group demonstrated longer average previous graft survival, after third HTx they demonstrate significantly poorer survival outcomes compared to third-time HTx recipients younger than 21 (P = 0.05). Age over 50, BMI over 30, and diabetes were all found to be independent risk factors for decreased survival following third HTx. We describe trends in patients undergoing third HTx. We highlight subsets of such recipients who exhibit decreased survival.
