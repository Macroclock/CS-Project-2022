Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation after Heart Transplantation: Impact of Type of Cannulation. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is a common cause of early death after heart transplantation (htx). The use of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) after htx has increased during the last years. It is still discussed controversially whether peripheral cannulation is favorable compared to central cannulation. We aimed to compare both cannulation techniques. Ninety patients underwent htx in our department between 2010 and 2017. Twenty-five patients were treated with ECLS due to PGD (10 central extracorporeal membrane oxygenator [cECMO] and 15 peripheral extracorporeal membrane oxygenator [pECMO] cannulation). Pre- and intraoperative parameters were comparable between both groups. Thirty-day mortality was comparable between the ECLS-groups (cECMO: 30%; pECMO: 40%,  In patients supported for PGD, peripheral and central cannulation strategies are safe and feasible for prolonged venoarterial ECMO support. There was no increase in bleeding after central implantation. With regard to the potential complications of a pECMO, we think that aortic cannulation with tunneling of the cannula and closure of the chest could be a good option in patients with PGD after htx.
