Anticoagulation management strategies in heart transplantation. Anticoagulation before, during, and after heart transplantation (HT) presents unique challenges to clinicians. Bleeding and thrombotic morbidity continues to affect this patient population throughout all phases of the HT journey. Reversal is commonly required since patients are commonly bridged to HT with left ventricular assist devices, which require chronic anti platelet and anticoagulation. Caution must be exercised in patients requiring cardiopulmonary bypass during surgery who are at risk of complications from heparin induced thrombocytopenia. The reported incidence of venous thromboembolism following HT is high, particularly during the first post-HT year, most likely due to surgery, biopsies, specific immunosuppression (mTOR inhibitors) and immobilization. It is crucial to maintain long-term oral anticoagulation after the first venous thromboembolism event, especially when risk factors exist. A major issue, and one for which there remains considerable debate, is the optimal treatment of such complications, particularly upper extremity venous thrombosis. For both warfarin and the thrombin inhibitors or Factor Xa inhibitors, the clinician must determine potential drug interactions based on the HT drug regimen, and then develop a patient-specific management strategy.
