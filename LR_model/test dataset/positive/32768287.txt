Mechanically Supported Early Graft Failure After Heart Transplantation. The occurrence of early graft failure (EGF) after heart transplantation (Htx) often requires a mechanical circulatory support (MCS) therapy. The aims of our study were to identify risk factors of mechanically supported severe EGF and evaluate their impact on both early and late outcomes. Between January 2000 and December 2019, 499 consecutive adult patients underwent Htx at our institution. Severe EGF was defined as the need for extracorporeal life support (ECLS) within 24 hours after surgery. All available recipient and donor variables were retrospectively analyzed. Overall, EGF occurred in 58 (11.6%) patients. Post-Htx peripheral or central ECLS was necessary in 32 (6.4%) cases. Independent predictors of severe EGF were, in the recipient group, preoperative transpulmonary gradient (TPG) >12 mm Hg (odds ratio [OR] 4.1, P = .013), preoperative inotropic score >10 (OR 7.3, P = .0001), and pre-Htx ECLS support (OR 5.2, P = .015), while in the donors, a Eurotransplant donor score ≥17 (OR 8.5, P = .005). The absence of EGF was related with a better survival at 1 year and 5 years (94% and 85%, respectively) compared with EGF requiring ECLS population (36% and 28% at 1 year and 5 years, respectively; P < .001). A five-year conditional survival rate did not differ significantly (85% no EGF vs 83% EGF requiring ECLS). Both donor and recipient factors may influence EGF occurrence. Post-Htx ECLS may impact negatively early; however, patients weaned from ECLS eventually benefit from such a rescue treatment with outcomes comparable with Htx patients who did not suffer EGF.
