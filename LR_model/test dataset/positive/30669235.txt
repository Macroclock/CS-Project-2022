Increased mortality, morbidities, and costs after heart transplantation in heterotaxy syndrome and other complex situs arrangements. Identify pediatric heart transplant (HT) recipients with heterotaxy and other complex arrangements of cardiac situs (heterotaxy/situs anomaly) and compare mortality, morbidities, length of stay (LOS), and costs to recipients with congenital heart disease without heterotaxy/situs anomaly. Using linked registry data (2001-2016), we identified 186 HT recipients with heterotaxy/situs anomaly and 1254 with congenital heart disease without heterotaxy/situs anomaly. We compared post-HT outcomes in univariable and multivariable time-to-event analyses. LOS and cost from HT to discharge were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Sensitivity analyses were performed using stricter heterotaxy/situs anomaly group inclusion criteria and through propensity matching. HT recipients with heterotaxy/situs anomaly were older (median age, 5.1 vs 1.6 years; P < .001) and more often black, Asian, Hispanic, or "other" nonwhite (54% vs 32%; P < .001). Heterotaxy/situs anomaly was independently associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-2.09; P = .002), even among 6-month survivors (hazard ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.16; P = .021). Heterotaxy/situs anomaly recipients more commonly required dialysis (odds ratio, 2.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.51-4.42; P = .001) and cardiac reoperation (odds ratio, 1.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-3.11; P = .010) before discharge. They had longer ischemic times (19.2 additional minutes [range, 10.9-27.5 minutes]; P < .001), post-HT intensive care unit LOS (16 vs 13 days; P = .012), and hospital LOS (26 vs 23 days; P = .005). Post-HT hospitalization costs were also greater ($447,604 vs $379,357; P = .001). Heterotaxy and other complex arrangements of cardiac situs are associated with increased mortality, postoperative complications, LOS, and costs after HT. Although increased surgical complexity can account for many of these differences, inferior late survival is not well explained and deserves further study.
