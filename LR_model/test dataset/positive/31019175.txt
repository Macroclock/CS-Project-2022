Institutional Case-Volume and Mortality After Heart Transplantation. The relationship between lower institutional case-volume and higher mortality after complex high-risk procedures has been shown. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of institutional volume on patient outcome after heart transplantation (HT) in the entire Korean population.We analyzed all adult HTs performed in Korea between 2007 and 2016 using data from the National Health Insurance Service. The association between case-volume and in-hospital mortality after HT was analyzed after categorizing hospitals performing HT into low-, medium-, or high-volume centers depending on the number of HTs performed. The effect of case-volume on long-term mortality was also assessed.A total of 833 adult HTs were performed in 17 centers. In-hospital mortality was 3.7% (13/356), 10.1% (38/375), and 18.6% (19/102) in high-, medium-, and low-volume centers, respectively. Medium-, and low-volume centers showed increased risk of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]; 2.11 [1.42-3.13] and 3.68 [2.16-2.27], respectively.). Long-term survival of up to 10 years was worse in lower-volume centers compared to high-volume centers (P < 0.001).In conclusion, lower case-volume was associated with increased in-hospital mortality and long-term mortality after HT. A minimum case-volume mandate may be required for hospitals performing HT to ensure the best patient outcome and effective resource allocation. 'Outcome'
