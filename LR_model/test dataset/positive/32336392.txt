Gender Differences in Postoperative Outcomes After Cardiac Surgery. Women presenting for cardiac surgery tend to be older and have hypertension, diabetes, and overweight or underweight body mass index than men. Despite improvements in surgical techniques and medications, women have increased risk for morbidity and mortality after multiple types of cardiac surgery. Women presenting for transcatheter aortic valve replacement are older and frailer than men, and have increased risk of intraoperative complications, but lower mortality at mid- and long-term ranges compared with men. Adherence to recovery and rehabilitation from cardiac surgery is challenging for women. Solutions should focus on increased family support, and use of group exercise and activities.
