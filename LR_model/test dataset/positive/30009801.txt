Listing Low-Weight or Ill Infants for Heart Transplantation: Is It Prudent? Infants awaiting heart transplantation (HTx) have the highest waitlist mortality than other HTx patients. This study analyzed the impact of weight and other factors on waitlist and post-HTx outcomes in infants. All infants on the HTx waitlist in the United Network for Organ Sharing database from October 1987 to June 2016 were divided into the following weight groups: less than 2.5 kg, 2.5 to 3.9 kg, and more than 4 kg. Survival from listing regardless of transplantation was compared by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Of 4,711 infants listed for HTx, 250 (5.3%) weighed less than 2.5 kg, 1,993 (42%) weighed 2.5 to 3.9 kg, and 2,468 (52%) weighed more than 4 kg. Median time on the waitlist was similar between the groups weighing less than 2.5 kg and 2.5 to 3.9 kg (28 days versus 31 days, p = 0.423), whereas the group weighing more than 4 kg waited longer (42 days; p = 0.027 and p < 0.001). Infants weighing less than 2.5 kg (1 year, 43%) had the worst survival from listing regardless of transplantation compared with other groups (versus weighing 2.5 to 3.9 kg: 1 year, 54%, p = 0.001; versus weighing >4 kg: 1 year, 66%, p < 0.001). For infants weighing less than 2.5 kg on ventilator support, the 1 year-survival was 35%, on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) it was 10%. For infants weighing 2.5 to 3.9 kg on ventilator support, the 1 year-survival was 45%, on ECMO it was 23%. An infant with congenital heart disease (CHD) on ventilator support awaiting transplantation has a 1 year-survival rate of 37% to 42% regardless of weight. Multivariate analysis found that weighing less than 2.5 kg and being on ventilator support, ECMO, or having CHD were associated with 1-year mortality. Survival of infants after being listed for HTx is substantially affected by weight but also by illness at listing. Therefore, going into a transplantation ill or too small, as seen in the present study, may not be prudent, given the limited resource of infant donors.
