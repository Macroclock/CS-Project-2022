High Transpulmonary Artery Gradient Obtained at the Time of Left Ventricular Assist Device Implantation Negatively Affects Survival After Cardiac Transplantation. Preoperatively elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is a contraindication to heart transplantation (HT). Transpulmonary pressure gradient (TPG) is one of the main variables used in PVR determination (ie, PVR = TPG/cardiac output). Unlike PVR, which is subject to the shortcoming of cardiac output estimation, TPG is directly measured. We aimed to evaluate the relationship of TPG obtained before left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation on post-HT survival. A total of 490 patients were implanted with Heartmate II LVADs in the multicenter Heartmate II Bridge-to-Transplantation clinical trial, and 416/490 had pre-LVAD TPG data available. Outcomes during LVAD support and after HT stratified by both PVR and TPG were studied. The median pre-LVAD TPG was 10 mm Hg. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar for patients with and without TPG >10 mm Hg. Outcomes during LVAD support (ie, recovery to LVAD explantation, HT, or ongoing device support) for patients below and above the median TPG were similar. However, post-HT 1-year survival rate was significantly higher for patients with TPG ≤10 mm Hg compared with those with TPG >10 mm Hg (91% vs 80%; P = .016). Analysis based on the median PVR of 2.68 Wood units did not stratify post-HTx 1-year survival rates between the groups (89% vs 83%; P = .25). Elevated TPG, rather than high PVR, before LVAD implantation was associated with increased mortality following HT. Pre-LVAD TPG may be useful to identify a cohort that requires close follow-up with serial hemodynamic monitoring before HT.
