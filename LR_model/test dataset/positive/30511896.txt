Impact of Donor Obesity on Outcomes After Orthotopic Heart Transplantation. Background The impact of donor obesity on the outcome of orthotopic heart transplantation has not been studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of donor obesity on the outcomes of adult orthotopic heart transplantation recipients. Methods and Results Data were obtained from the United Network for Organ Sharing database. All adult (age ≥18 years) patients undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation from 2000 through 2016 were included (n=31 920). We stratified the cohort by donor body mass index ( BMI ); 13 015 patients (40.8%) received a heart from a normal-weight donor ( BMI 18.5-24.9), 11 271 patients (35.3%) received a heart from an overweight donor ( BMI 25.0-29.9), 4910 patients (15.4%) received a heart from an obese donor ( BMI 30.0-34.9), and 2724 patients (8.5%) received a heart from an extremely obese donor ( BMI ≥35). The cohort of obese donors was older, included a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus, and had a higher creatinine. Our data also showed that the recipients of obese donor grafts were older, had a higher BMI , creatinine, percentage of diabetes mellitus, and longer total waiting period. There was no significant difference detected in the survival likelihood ( P=0.08) of patients based on a donor's BMI-based categorized cohort. There were no significant differences found in the overall survival probability among 4 groups in the adjusted survival analyses ( P=0.25). Conclusions This study demonstrated that patients receiving higher BMI donor hearts might not be subjected to an increased risk of death, at least during the short term after transplant, compared with those using the normal-weight donors.
