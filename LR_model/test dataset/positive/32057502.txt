Impact of Preoperative Pulmonary Hypertension on Survival in Patients Undergoing Elective Heart Transplant. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) represents a marker of bad prognosis in left heart disease. Nonetheless, the effect on survival after heart transplant remains controversial. The objective was to study the impact of preoperative PAH on survival in patients undergoing elective heart transplant. A retrospective study of 173 transplant recipients was conducted at a single hospital from January 2009 to December 2018. Congenital etiology and emergent heart transplant were exclusion criteria as well as those patients without enough data in the hemodynamic study. Two groups were considered: A (without PAH) and B (with HTP). PAH was classified as mild (mean pulmonary arterial pressure [mPAP] 25-34 mm Hg, pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR] 2.5-3.4 Wood units and/or transpulmonary gradient [TPG] 13-16 mm Hg), moderate (mPAP 35-44 mm Hg, PVR 3.5-4.9 Wood units and/or TPG 17-19 mm Hg), and severe (mPAP > 44 mm Hg, PVR > 4.9 Wood units and/or TPG > 19 mm Hg). A total of 102 patients were enrolled; 71.6% were male and average age was 52.3 (SD, 10.02) years. The main etiology was ischemic cardiomyopathy; 13.7% underwent previous heart operations. A total of 61 patients (59.8%) had PAH prior to heart transplant: 25 mild, 34 moderate, and 2 severe. Mean overall survival after transplant was 79.9 (SD, 5.68) months, without differences between the 2 groups (P = .82). One-month survival was 89% (the main cause of mortality was primary graft dysfunction), and 1-year survival was 78%. Four patients required mechanical circulatory support during early post-transplant period. Preoperative PAH does not have a significant impact on survival in elective heart transplant.
