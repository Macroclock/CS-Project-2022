Right Ventricular Assist Devices After Heart Transplantation. Severe right ventricular failure (RVF) has a significant incidence among cardiac transplant patients. It is a serious complication and an independent risk factor for postoperative mortality. In this setting, ventricular assist devices (VADs) must be considered if conservative medical management fails. This study sought to examine our series of patients with early RVF after heart transplantation requiring VAD support. We analyzed consecutive, adult heart transplant recipients at a third level intensive care unit who underwent transplantation from January 2011 to March 2019 requiring post-transplant mechanical circulatory support for RVF. Demographic characteristics, clinical data, complications, and survival rates were collected. Ten patients were included. Median age was 50 years (range, 31.7-57). Eight patients (80%) were male. The most frequent indication for heart transplantation was ischemic heart disease (4 patients) followed by dilated cardiomyopathy and congenital heart disease (2 patients). Preoperative pulmonary hypertension was present in 6 patients. Three patients required a VAD before transplant. Whole survival rate was 60%. After heart transplantation, 7 patients required renal replacement therapy, 2 patients suffered a hemorrhagic stroke, and 5 patients needed a tracheostomy for long-term ventilation. Patients who develop RVF after transplantation have an increased incidence of complications and high mortality after surgery. VADs could be implanted immediately after heart transplantation in high-risk patients.
