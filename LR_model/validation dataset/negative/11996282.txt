Eosinophilic heart disease with vasculitis: supported by HeartMate left ventricular assist device and heart transplantation. Eosinophilic heart disease is rarely seen in clinical practice. We report a patient with eosinophilic heart disease who presented with acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. Because of lack of a donor organ and progressive deterioration of his general condition in spite of intraaortic balloon pumping, a left ventricular assist device (HeartMate 1000 IP; Thermo Cardiosystems Inc, Woburn, MA) was implanted before development of irreversible multiple organ failure and was followed by heart transplantation.
