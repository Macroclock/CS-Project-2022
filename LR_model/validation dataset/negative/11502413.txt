Intracranial bleed during bridge to transplant may not preclude a successful result. We report the case of a 29-year-old man who suffered sub-arachnoid bleeding while stabilized on a biventricular assist device as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. We adjusted his anti-coagulation therapy to control the bleeding and to concurrently minimize thrombosis while on support. He underwent 2 craniotomy operations to evacuate sub-arachnoid hematomas, and he underwent a subsequent operation to debride and close the dura. Eighteen days later, he underwent successful orthotopic heart transplant and was discharged to home 3 weeks post-transplant.
