Combined transplantation of the heart, lung, and liver. Combined transplantation of the heart, lung, and liver may be indicated in patients with either end-stage respiratory failure complicated by advanced liver disease or end-stage liver failure complicated by advanced lung disease. A retrospective review of nine patients who underwent combined heart-lung-liver transplantation in Cambridge (1986-99) was carried out. The 1-year and 5-year actuarial survival was 56% and 42%, respectively. Combined heart-lung-liver transplantation is a feasible option for a few patients and has a 5-year survival similar to heart-lung transplantation but with a lower incidence of acute and chronic rejection.
