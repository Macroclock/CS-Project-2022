Inhomogeneity of myocardial perfusion in heart transplant recipients: evaluation with dobutamine thallium-201 SPECT. Progressive heterogeneity of thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography (Tl-201 SPECT) in heart transplant recipients has been documented in Caucasians. However, in Chinese heart transplant recipients, a lower incidence of transplant coronary artery disease (CAD) has been noted than in Western transplant recipients. In this study, we examine whether heterogeneity of Tl-201 SPECT exists in Chinese transplant recipients. Dobutamine Tl-201 SPECT was performed in 40 heart transplant recipients and the inhomogeneity scores were calculated. The difference between the scores of transplant recipients surviving less than 12 months and those of control subjects were not statistically significant. One year after transplantation, the inhomogeneity score increased progressively. The scores of transplant patients in the second and third years after transplant were similar to those of single-vessel CAD patients. Three years after transplant the scores were greatly increased. Thus, our data suggest that the progressive nature of graft vasculopathy also exists in Chinese heart transplant recipients. The progressive Tl-201 abnormalities may be one of the early signs of graft vasculopathy.
