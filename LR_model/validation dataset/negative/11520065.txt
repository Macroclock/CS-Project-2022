Green fluorescent protein-transgenic rat: a tool for organ transplantation research. The purpose of this study is to evaluate green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic rats for use as a tool for organ transplantation research. The GFP gene construct was designed to express ubiquitously. By flow cytometry, the cells obtained from the bone marrow, spleen, and peripheral blood of the GFP transgenic rats consisted of 77, 91, and 75% GFP-positive cells, respectively. To examine cell migration of GFP-positive cells after organ transplantation, pancreas graft with or without spleen transplantation, heart graft with or without lung transplantation, auxiliary liver and small bowel transplantation were also performed from GFP transgenic rat to LEW (RT1(1)) rats under a 2-week course of 0.64 mg/kg tacrolimus administration. GFP-positive donor cells were detected in the fully allogenic LEW rats after organ transplantation. These results showed that GFP transgenic rat is a useful tool for organ transplantation research such as cell migration study after organ transplantation without donor cell staining.
