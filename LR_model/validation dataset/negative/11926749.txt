Hypogammaglobulinemia after heart transplantation: impact of pre-emptive use of immunoglobulin replacement (CytoGam) on infection and rejection outcomes. Hypogammaglobulinemia (HGG) in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients confers an increased risk of opportunistic infections and poorer outcomes. Severe HGG (IgG < 350 mg/dL) after heart transplantation may follow intensification of immunosuppressive therapy and the resultant increased risk of opportunistic infections, particularly cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease. Evaluation of the effects of replacement therapy using intravenous immunoglobulin (CMV-IGIV, CytoGam) was conducted in cardiac transplant recipients and the data matched with a historical control group. Patients with severe HGG who received pre-emptive replacement therapy had significantly fewer opportunistic infections (P < 0.001) and episodes of rejection (grade > or = 3; P = 0.03 and grade > or = 2; P = 0.04) compared with the control group.
