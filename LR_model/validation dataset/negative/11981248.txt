Prevention of osteoporosis in cardiac transplant recipients. Osteoporosis is a leading cause of pretransplant and posttransplant morbidity. The need for early detection by measuring bone mineral density, even before transplant, must be emphasized. Preventive measures are not comparable. The use of calcium and vitamin D supplements, although recommended, is inadequate for the prevention of bone loss and complications such as vertebral fractures. Bisphosphonates have been shown to attenuate the bone loss and reduce fractures associated with steroid-induced osteoporosis. Small studies in transplant recipients suggest similar results. Other preventive measures such as hormone replacement therapy are also helpful. There are limited data on the administration of nasal calcitonin in transplant recipients.
