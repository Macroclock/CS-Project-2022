Successful use of cardiac allograft from serotonin antagonist intoxication. Compromised organ donors are generally not accepted for heart transplantation (HT) despite the increasing number of critically ill patients on the waiting lists. By extending the donor criteria to include certain cases of intoxication, the organ shortage may be reduced. The case of a successful orthotopic HT with an allograft from a donor poisoned by antidepressant overdose is presented. Early graft function was satisfactory with anteroseptal dyskinesis and an ejection fraction of 75% on echocardiography. The cardiac allograft recipient suffered some postoperative complications including gastrointestinal problems. The following period was up to now uneventful. Discharge from the intensive care unit was after 4 days. In-hospital stay was prolonged at 26 days. Because of limited myocardial toxicity, donor hearts from certain victims of antidepressant intoxication may be safely used for HT. Existing cardiac organ donor criteria must be reevaluated to maximise the available organ pool.
