Impact of mild pulmonary hypertension on mortality and pulmonary artery pressure profile after heart transplantation. Pulmonary hypertension is a risk factor for early mortality after transplantation, but the risk threshold is debated. Also, little is known about the evolution of pulmonary circulation after transplantation. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of current risk pulmonary pressure parameters on early post-operative mortality and to assess the time-related changes in pulmonary pressure after surgery. One hundred twelve consecutive transplanted patients were studied retrospectively to determine the influence of trans-pulmonary gradient of >12 mm Hg and pulmonary vascular resistance of >2.5 Wood units, at baseline or after vasodilator test, on early mortality. A multivariate analysis was used to study the hemodynamic parameters associated with early mortality. The pulmonary pressures of all surviving patients were studied for up to 3 years after surgery. Early mortality in the groups with and without pulmonary hypertension were 24.4% and 5.6%, respectively (p =.009). The only variable that was independently associated with early mortality was the pulmonary vascular resistance index (odds ratio = 1.459). Mild pulmonary hypertension disappeared 1 year after heart transplantation. Mild pulmonary hypertension is a risk factor for early postoperative mortality. The hemodynamic parameter most closely associated with early mortality is pulmonary vascular resistance index. The hemodynamic profile of pulmonary circulation after heart transplantation is partially dependent on the level of pulmonary hypertension before transplantation, at least during the first year after surgery.
