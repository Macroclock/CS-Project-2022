New devices for chronic ventricular support. Congestive heart failure affects 5 million people in the United States with 500,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Medical and surgical therapy have helped many patients but when these options fail, heart transplantation remains the only other treatment available to help improve their condition. Heart transplantation suffers from the lack of a sufficient number of suitable donor organs, the complications of chronic immunosuppression, and many patients die while on the waiting list. A number of pulsatile and nonpulsatile cardiac assist devices are being developed to provide chronic support for patients with heart failure and to be an alternative to heart transplantation. It is estimated that as many as 60,000 patients with heart failure could be helped by mechanical devices used for chronic support. For these devices to be effective they must provide sufficient cardiac output to allow patients to perform their daily activities, have a low risk of thromboemboli, be fully implantable thereby reducing the risk of infection, and have a low incidence of device malfunction requiring part or all of the device to be replaced. In this article, we will review several new devices which have been developed over the past 5 years or so and will be in human clinical trials in the United States soon, either as a bridge or as an alternative to heart transplantation.
