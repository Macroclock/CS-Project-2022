Use of a donor heart that had undergone previous cardiac surgery for ASD closure. We report the use of a heart from a 19-year-old female donor who had undergone open heart surgery for closure of an atrial septal defect at the age of 12. The explantation procedure was modified to prevent hemodynamic instability. The recipient, a 59-year-old male with increased pulmonary vascular resistance had an uneventful recovery after transplantation.
