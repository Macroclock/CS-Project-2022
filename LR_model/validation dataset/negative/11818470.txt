Heart transplantation: a thirty-year perspective. Heart transplantation has evolved over the past 30 years into a mainstay of therapy for heart failure patients.

This review addresses the history, current surgical technique, recipient and donor selection, postoperative care, immunosuppression, short- and long-term complications, and clinical outcomes associated with this procedure.
