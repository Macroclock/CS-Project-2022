[Epstein-Barr virus infection in patients after bone marrow and heart transplantation]. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections in immunosuppressed patients cause the severe clinical problems. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) might occur as a result of the latent EBV activation. Occurrence of active EBV infection in heart and bone marrow transplant patients. 68 serum samples obtained from 13 allogenic bone marrow and 20 heart transplant patients were tested by IF and ELISA methods. Antibodies against VCA, EA and EBNA antigens were measured. All patients showed the presence of anti-VCA IgG antibodies, thus all were seropositive. Three patients (9%) showed primary EBV infection while in 12 (36%) patients virus reactivation or reinfection was confirmed. 1. EBV infection in immunosuppressed patients is mainly caused by latent virus reactivation. 2. Type of EBV infection can be confirmed serologically only by the detection of specific anti-VCA, EA and EBNA antibodies. 3. The risk of PTLD in transplant patients creates the need for frequent monitoring.
