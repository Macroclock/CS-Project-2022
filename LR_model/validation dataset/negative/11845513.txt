Social support, personal control, and psychosocial recovery following heart transplantation. To study the influence of psychosocial resources on psychological recovery after heart transplantation, 28 patients were surveyed during their hospitalization after transplant surgery and 6 months posttransplantation. Scales from the Coping With Serious Illness Battery were used to measure psychosocial resources (social support and personal control) and psychological and functional outcomes. Psychosocial resources assessed during hospitalization were associated with recovery outcomes at 6 months posttransplantation. Personal control was positively correlated with optimism, well-being, and satisfaction with life (r = .41 to .49) and negatively correlated with anger (r = -.57) and depression (r = -.52). Social support network helpfulness and attachment with others were correlated with psychological outcomes (r = .41 to .59) and functional outcome (r = .42 to .47). Efforts directed toward enhancing perceptions of personal control, social support network helpfulness, and attachment may be useful for promoting psychosocial recovery.
