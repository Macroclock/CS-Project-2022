Blockade of the CD28 and CD40 pathways result in the acceptance of pig and rat islet xenografts but not rat cardiac grafts in mice. Previously, we demonstrated that combination CTLA4-Fc and anti-CD40L mAb treatment results in tolerance to concordant, cellular islet xenografts. The aim of this study was to determine its effectiveness in a model of fetal pig pancreas (FPP) xenotransplantation. Survival of FPP fragment grafts were compared to the survival of rat islet or cardiac xenografts following short term CTLA4-Fc and anti-CD40L mAb treatment. Rat islet and FPP fragment grafts survived long-term. However, rat cardiac grafts were rejected by 52-91 days. Both rat islet and FPP grafts showed similar histology with intact islet structures and adjacent 'nests' of lymphocytes. Concordant vascularised rat hearts showed extensive polymorphonuclear infiltrate, concentric vasculitis and a perivascular infiltrate predominantly of CD8+ T cells. This suggests that this therapy is effective for prolonging islet xenografts and demonstrates that the cellular mechanism of rejection for vascularised and non-vascularised xenografts are different.
