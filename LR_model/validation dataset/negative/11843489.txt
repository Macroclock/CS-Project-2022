Human pathologic validation of left ventricular linear lesion formation guided by noncontact mapping. This case report describes the histopathologic findings associated with two left ventricular, linear radiofrequency lesions in a patient who underwent cardiac transplantation shortly after an ablation procedure for ventricular tachycardia. The lesions were created with conventional ablation equipment guided by a noncontact mapping system. The findings provide pathologic validation that continuous, linear lesions are feasible using a noncontact mapping system for guidance.
