Characteristics and clinical relevance of chronic anemia in adult heart transplant recipients. Mild chronic anemia following heart transplantation (HTX), with hemoglobin (Hb) values of 10-14 g/dL in men and 10-12 g/dL in women, is frequent. It has continued to be of uncertain etiology yet clinical relevance. Nonetheless, therapeutic immunosuppression has been regarded as a major cause of chronic anemia in HTX patients. Sixty outpatients were observed over a period of 5 yr after HTX. Laboratory values related to anemia such as Hb, erythropoietin (EPO), ferritin, transferrin, iron, and vitamin levels were obtained and analyzed monthly. Patients were divided into two groups retrospectively. Patients with persistent anemia for more than 1 yr were compared with non-anemic patients. Forty-three (72%) of the 60 patients were anemic. Anemia was normochromic, normocytic, and slightly anisocytic. Anemic and non-anemic patients showed EPO levels within the expected range as defined by Erslev (Erythropoietin. N Engl J Med 1991: 324: 1339). Reticulocyte counts were found to be normal in all patients. Iron deficiency and deficiency of vitamin B12 or folic acid were not observed. Patients with persistent anemia showed a significantly shorter survival period than non-anemic patients (p<0.02). Mild anemia following HTX shows the same characteristics as anemia in chronic diseases. Persisting mild anemia used to be associated with a shorter life expectancy. There is no evidence that standard immunosuppression causes anemia.
