Circulating monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in heart transplant recipients with cardiac allograft vasculopathy. To evaluate serum Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1) as a biologic marker of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) in heart transplant recipients (HTR). Serum levels of MCP-1 were measured in 49 HTR with and without CAV. HTR exhibited significantly higher serum MCP-1 levels than controls. However, no difference was observed according to the existence of CAV. Serum MCP-1 levels do not constitute a marker of the CAV occurring after heart transplantation.
