Evaluation of a mentorship program for heart transplant patients. The Heart Transplant Mentor Programme (HTMP) was initiated to augment patient care by providing patients and families with information and support from a peer perspective. We assessed program effectiveness with a pilot study of semi-structured interviews of 63% (10/16) of the mentored patients and an open-ended inquiry that rated the program on a 5-point scale (1, poor, to 5, excellent) and that selected descriptors of the program. Qualitative and quantitative analyses indicated that participants found the information and support provided by their mentors positive (3.8 and 4.0, respectively), discussion focused on medical rather than psychosocial topics, pre-transplant dissatisfaction with the program was caused by late or little mentor contact, and post-transplant dissatisfaction was attributed to difference in clinical course between mentor and patient. Although findings indicate that HTMP augments patient care, recommendations to increase patient satisfaction include earlier introduction of a mentor and individualizing mentors according to demographics and clinical course.
