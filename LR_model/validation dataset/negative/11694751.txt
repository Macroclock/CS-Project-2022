A case of fetal parvovirus B19 myocarditis, terminal cardiac heart failure, and perinatal heart transplantation. We report a case of fetal cardiomegaly secondary to myocarditis as a result of intrauterine parvovirus B19 infection. The fetus was delivered through caesarean section because of increasing deterioration of cardiac function at 33 + 3 weeks with reverse flow in the ductus venosus. Four weeks later, a cardiac transplantation was carried out because of therapy-resistant dilative cardiomyopathy. This case shows that fetal parvovirus B19 infection may occur without anemia and myocarditis and does not always result in spontaneous reformation of a dilated heart and normal recovery. It may become the determining prognostic factor for the child.
