[Fungal infections in heart transplantation]. Invasive fungal infections remain one of the challenging complications after solid organ transplantation. Although, having a lower incidence than viral and bacterial infections, fungal infections carry the risk of higher mortality. Management of fungal infections involves several difficulties: the difficulty of early diagnosis including the lack of reliable diagnostic methods, limited effective therapy associated with side effects and drug interaction with immunosuppressive drugs. Reduction of risk factors and preemptive antifungal therapy prevents and improves the outcome of invasive fungal infections in heart transplant recipients.
