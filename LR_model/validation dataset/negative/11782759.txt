Improved right heart function after myocardial preservation with 2,3-butanedione 2-monoxime in a porcine model of allogenic heart transplantation. Right heart dysfunction is a major cause for early morbidity and mortality after heart transplantation. Experiments were designed to evaluate the influence of the calcium-desensitizing drug 2,3-butanedione 2-monoxime (BDM) on right heart function in a porcine model of heart transplantation. Donor hearts of domestic pigs were arrested with BDM in Krebs solution (n = 7) and with BDM in Bretschneider's histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution (n = 6). There were 2 control groups: University of Wisconsin (UW, n = 6) and HTK (n = 6). An isovolumic model was used in which the right ventricular volume was precisely controlled in vivo with an intracavitary high-compliance balloon. After 4 hours of ischemia, hearts were transplanted into recipients. After 1 and 2 hours of reperfusion, the right ventricular balloon volume was increased in 10-mL increments until right ventricular failure occurred and the developed pressures were recorded. Maximal right ventricular developed pressures were significantly different after 2 hours of reperfusion (UW: 35 +/- 13 mm Hg; HTK: 47 +/- 8 mm Hg; Krebs+BDM: 49 +/- 9 mm Hg; HTK+BDM: 50 +/- 6 mm Hg; P =.04). Hearts subjected to BDM could be loaded with a significantly increased volume after 1 hour and after 2 hours (UW: 57 +/- 10 mL vs HTK: 43 +/- 8 mL vs Krebs+BDM: 70 +/- 10 mL vs HTK+BDM: 67 +/- 15 mL; P =.002). Postischemic right ventricular enddiastolic compliance was significantly increased in groups treated with BDM after 1 hour (P =.02) and after 2 hours (P =.039). The drug BDM significantly improves right ventricular function in a heart transplantation model. The increase in volume load and developed right ventricular pressure achieved by BDM application would translate into a decreased risk of right ventricular failure after clinical transplantation.
