Stenting unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis in heart transplant patients--the good, bad, and the ugly. The major cause of late death following orthotopic heart transplantation is coronary artery vasculopathy. Approximately 50% of heart transplant patients have coronary artery vasculopathy 5 years post-transplantation. With advances in interventional cardiology technology, heart transplant patients with selected lesions are now undergoing intravascular stenting with acute-gain and late-loss rates similar to stenting in non-transplanted patients. We describe 3 consecutive cases of stenting unprotected left main coronary artery disease in orthotropic heart transplant patients. With follow-up to 3 years and no evidence of restenosis, these results suggest that stenting unprotected left main coronary artery lesions in heart transplant patients can be performed with excellent immediate and long-term results.
