Pretransplant rinse of hearts preserved with colloid-free UW solution and more effective heart preservation: studies in a rat abdominal heart transplant model. University of Wisconsin solution (UW) provides effective heart preservation under hypothermic conditions, but it can be deleterious at warmer temperatures. Re-warming during the implantation of the graft may be a problem. This study examined the damaging effect of peri-operative warm ischemia in a transplant setting and recovery from such damage. The amelioration of damage by rinsing the graft before re-warming and transplantation was also examined. Rat donor hearts were preserved for 2 hr (0 degrees C) as follows: Series A was preserved with colloid-free UW (MUW), St. Thomas' solution (ST), or calcium-supplemented MUW (MUW+Ca) followed by either transplantation or warming (22 degrees C) for 10 min before transplantation. Series B was preserved with MUW, rinsed with fresh MUW, ST, MUW+Ca, or low-potassium MUW before warming and transplantation. All heart isografts were transplanted heterotopically with an indwelling left intraventricular balloon-tipped catheter. Graft function was measured 1 and 7 days after transplantation. Grafts re-warmed rapidly during implantation. Function (left ventricular developed pressure, contractility, and relaxation) was significantly and persistently diminished in MUW-preserved grafts subjected to additional warming before transplantation. Preservation with ST was less effective than MUW despite being unaffected by warming. Preservation with MUW+Ca and rinsing with fresh MUW or ST before re-warming allowed recovery of function within 7 days despite significantly diminished function on day 1. This study demonstrated that an increase in the peri-transplant warm ischemic period was detrimental when hearts were preserved with MUW. Preservation with calcium-supplemented MUW or rinsing the heart with fresh MUW or ST before transplantation ameliorated this damage.
