Education of the ventricular assist device patient's community services. Two implantable, electric left ventricular assist systems have received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use outside a hospital environment. As patients supported with these systems are discharged from the hospital, it is important that various community services and agencies be involved in the care of this unique patient population. Between January 1999 and May 2001, The University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC) implanted 14 HeartMate VE LVAS (Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA) in patients as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. Of these 14 patients, 13 were discharged home from the hospital. On the basis of our 3 year experience, a discharge program has been developed to educate the ventricular assist device (VAD) patient's community services. Ten community services most critical to a safe home discharge program are identified. Timing of service contact, mechanism of contact, community education method, education content, education materials, and outpatient community service usage are described.
