Tolerization of Gal alpha 1,3Gal-reactive B cells in pre-sensitized alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase-deficient mice by nonmyeloablative induction of mixed chimerism. Using a alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase wild-type (GalT(+/+)) to deficient (GalT(-/-)) mouse bone marrow transplantation model, we have previously demonstrated that a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen is capable of permitting induction of allogeneic and xenogeneic mixed chimerism. Chimerism is associated with the rapid and lasting tolerization of anti-Gal alpha 1,3Gal (Gal) natural antibody (Ab)-producing B cells. However, one limitation of this model is that anti-Gal natural Ab levels are lower in GalT(-/-) mice than in humans and other primates. To overcome this limitation, we have now investigated the possibility of inducing such tolerance in GalT(-/-) mice that produce much higher levels of anti-Gal Abs due to presensitization with Gal-bearing xenogeneic cells. B6 GalT(-/-) mice that were pre-sensitized with rabbit red blood cells received non-myeloablative conditioning with depleting anti-CD4 and CD8 mAbs, 3Gy whole body and 7Gy thymic irradiation, and infusion of BALB/c GalT(+/+) bone marrow cells (BMC). Although engraftment of standard marrow doses was inhibited by the presensitization, long-lasting mixed chimerism could be induced in recipients of a high dose [160 x 10(6)] of allogeneic wild-type BMC. Achievement of persistent chimerism was associated with high levels of anti-Gal IgG(1) pretransplant, suggesting an inhibitory effect of non-complement-fixing IgG(1) Ab on anti-Gal-mediated marrow rejection. Induction of mixed chimerism was associated with a rapid disappearance of serum anti-Gal and tolerization of anti-Gal Ab-producing cells. B cells with anti-Gal receptors became undetectable in mixed chimeras. Mixed chimeras accepted subsequently transplanted donor-type GalT(+/+) hearts (> 140 days), whereas rapid (within 2 days) rejection of GalT(+/+) hearts occurred in conditioned control GalT(-/-) mice. In conclusion, when a high dose of GalT(+/+) BMC was administered to pre-sensitized GalT(-/-) mice, chimerism and tolerance were achieved. The absence of B cells with receptors recognizing Gal in mixed chimeras suggests a role for clonal deletion/receptor editing in the maintenance of B cell tolerance.
