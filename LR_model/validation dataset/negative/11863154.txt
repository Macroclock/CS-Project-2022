Effects of dental local anaesthetics in cardiac transplant recipients. To investigate the cardiovascular responses of cardiac transplant recipients to dental local anaesthetic solutions with and without epinephrine (adrenaline). A clinical study employing 30 patients (20 cardiac transplant recipients and ten healthy) awaiting gingival or minor oral surgery under local anaesthesia receiving either 4.4 ml lidocaine (lignocaine) with 1:80,000 epinephrine or 4.4 ml 3% prilocaine with 0.031 U/ml felypressin. Cardiac transplant patients experienced a significant tachycardia 10 minutes after injection of the epinephrine-containing solution. No significant change in heart rate was detected after the injection of an epinephrine-free solution. Blood pressure was not affected. Periodontal surgery did not affect the responses to the local anaesthetics in the transplant recipients. The cardiovascular response to dental local anaesthesia in cardiac transplant recipients is governed by the solution injected.
