[Echocardiography after orthotopic heart transplantation]. One of the most serious complications after orthotopic transplantation of the heart (OTH) is graft rejection. Its early detection can help successful control. The diagnostic gold standard is myocardial biopsy, it is however not always supreme. We tried to find out whether some modern echocardiographic methods can provide further valuable information. At the same time we were concerned with the follow up of basic variables of the circulation and echocardiographic indicators of left ventricular function. The authors examined repeatedly 22 patients where in 1998-2000 OTH was performed, who did not have an acute severe rejection, who had at least one myocardial biopsy between the first and second month after OTH without signs of rejection and who were easily examined by echocardiography. In addition to the standard follow up according to a routine pattern they were subjected to clinical and echocardiographic examination during the 1st-2nd month after OTH, 6 months after the first examination and one year after the second examination. Classical echocardiography, acoustic densitometry and Doppler tissue examination of the movement of the mitral ring were used. The patients had throughout the investigation period clinical cardiological complications. Between the first and second examination the systolic pressure rose from 125.4 +/- 9.5 to 135.4 +/- 13.5 mm Hg (p < 0.05), the diastolic pressure from 79.6 +/- 8.2 to 86.4 +/- 9.5 mm (p < 0.05), during the third examination it dropped again to original values. During the follow up no significant differences developed in indicators of classical echocardiography, acoustic densitometry and Doppler tissue echocardiography. Of 22 patients however myocardial biopsy of the right ventricle proved rejection only in two. In those the authors did not observe any echocardiographic changes during rejection. In one patient who died echocardiography revealed a decline of left ventricular function and a non-specific bioptic finding, and on necropsy severe cellular vascular rejection. Blood pressure rises early in some patients after OTH, it is therefore important to monitor it carefully and to administer early and systematic treatment of hypertension. In non-complicated patients the echocardiographic findings did not change. Because of the low number of rejections the authors were not able to prove the importance of some new echocardiographic methods. In view of discrepancies between methods in some patients with rejection a comprehensive diagnostic approach is still necessary: myocardial biopsy supplemented by further examinations, in particular echocardiographic ones.
