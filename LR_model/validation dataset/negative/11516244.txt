Primary cutaneous microangiopathy in heart recipients. In this study we investigated whether a disturbance in microcirculation is detectable in heart recipients with cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) and severe hypercholesterolemia (n = 11) and in 7 heart recipients without CAV in comparison to patients with severe coronary artery disease (n = 49) and age-matched apparently healthy subjects (n = 100). For this purpose, the flow velocity of erythrocytes through cutaneous capillaries at the nail fold of the finger was measured under resting conditions. In addition, reactive hyperemia in the same capillaries after a 3-min ischemia was determined. Patients with CAV and severe lipid disorder showed a pathological reduction in mean capillary erythrocyte velocity under resting conditions with v(RBC) = 0.10 +/- 0.07 mm/s. The latter was significantly and relevantly lower than in patients with coronary three-vessel disease (v(RBC) = 0.46 +/- 0.35 mm/s). It was notable that under resting conditions temporary cessation of flow occurred in 8 of the 11 patients which did not occur in healthy subjects and rarely in patients with three-vessel disease (1 of 49 patients). In comparison to age-matched healthy subjects (v(max) = 1.46 +/- 0.52 mm/s), the patients with three-vessel disease showed a significant reduction in postischemic maximum erythrocyte velocity (v(max) = 0.85 +/- 0.55 mm/s), with a considerable shortening of the duration of reactive hyperemia. Patients with CAV demonstrated a total loss of postischemic reactive hyperemia (only 1 of the 11 patients presented a weak reactive hyperemia). Since no macroangiopathy was detectable in the upstream arm arteries, primary cutaneous microangiopathy can be assumed in patients with cardiac allograft vasculopathy and severe hypercholesterolemia.
