[Pharmacotherapeutical approaches to insomnia patients with cardiac diseases and after heart transplantation]. Insomnia in patients with heart transplantation and cardiac disease is a common problem. Organic factors, immunodepressant medication (e.g. ciclosporine and steroids) and psychological factors may account for this symptom. The article reviews different hypnotic drugs and their value in the treatment of insomnia. For short-time treatment, medication with benzodiazepine hypnotics may be useful. If the problems of drug dependence and rebound insomnia are taken into consideration, treatment with non-benzodiazepine hypnotics offers more safety and comfort. If insomnia is part of a depressive syndrome, pharmacotherapeutical intervention with antidepressive sedative medication is required. With regard to cardiac disease, treatment with mirtazapine, nefazodone or trazodone should be preferred because of the chinidine-like effect of tricyclic antidepressants (TCA). Sedative neuroleptic medication (e.g. melperone) is commonly given to geriatric patients; nevertheless, patients with chronic insomnia may also benefit from this medication. The risks and benefits of hypnotic drugs are discussed especially in relation to pharmacological interaction (cytochrome system) and cardiac disease.
