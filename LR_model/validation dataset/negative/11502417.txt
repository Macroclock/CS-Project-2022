First successful Italian clinical experience with DeBakey VAD. The growing number of patients waiting for heart transplantation more than tripled between 1989 and 1998. Various non-pulsatile mechanical circulatory support devices have been developed as bridge to heart transplantation in recent years. We report the first successful Italian clinical experience with an axial-flow pump, DeBakey VAD, in a patient supported as bridge to transplantation for 55 days.
