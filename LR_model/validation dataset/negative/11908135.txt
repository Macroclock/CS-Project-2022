[Mouth ulcers in patients receiving tacrolimus]. The buccal side effects of immunodepressors are well defined with cyclosporine and certain antimitotic agents. We report a case of buccal ulcerations in a patient treated with a new immunosuppressive macrolide: tacrolimus (Prograf). A 53 year-old woman presenting a severe cardio-myopathy, underwent heart transplantation in May 1997. Tacrolimus was introduced in October 1997 after 3 episodes of acute reject. Eight months after tacrolimus, painful apthoid buccal ulcerations appeared. Biopsy of the buccal mucosa and other biological examinations revealed no particular etiology. Since tacrolimus could not be stopped, treatment with thalidomide was initiated. It was suspended on two occasions due to adverse events. The buccal ulcerations relapsed rapidly. The intrinsic imputability of tacrolimus in the occurrence of these lesions was noted "l2" ("plausible"). Several arguments suggest that these buccal ulcerations may result from the toxicity of tacrolimus: 1) absence of past history of apthae; 2) anatomo-clinical aspect of the lesion differing from that of common apthae, but similar to the ulcerations observed with nicorandil; 3) delay in occurrence of analogous ulcerations compared with that observed with methotrexate or nicorandil; 4) absence of another etiology; 5) relapse of ulcerations on two occasions after suspension of thalidomide, whilst tacrolimus was continued.
