The pathology of cardiac xenografts. The pathology of cardiac xenografts has yielded critical insights into the mechanisms of xenograft rejection and the therapeutic procedures that might be applied to preventing or treating it. The conditions seen in rejecting cardiac xenografts include hyperacute rejection, acute vascular rejection, and cellular rejection. Hyperacute and acute vascular rejection of cardiac xenografts have features typical of humoral injury. Less is known about cellular rejection and only speculation can be offered about chronic rejection. Still, these features allow critical testing of pathogenetic mechanisms and therapies.
