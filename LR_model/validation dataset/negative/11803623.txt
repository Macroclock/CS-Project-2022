[A new model of isolated perfused heart. Study of hypodermin A in hyperacute xenograft rejection]. Isolated perfused heart (IPH) system and heart transplantation in the guinea-pig/rat combination represent a good model for the study of hyperacute xenograft rejection (HAR) in which the component plays a central role. Hypodermin A (HA), a protease cleaving the component, could be used to delay the HAR. Creation of an original IPH working with rat serum (30 mL) and ex vivo study of HAR and I'HA. Study of HAR is possible with this IPH system. The mean guinea-pig heart survival after perfusion by normal rat serum was 38 +/- 7 min and was lower than survival observed after perfusion by guinea-pig serum (210 +/- 34 min) (p < 0.001), by decomplemented rat serum (177 +/- 45 min) (p < 0.001), and by rat serum with 20 micrograms/mL of HA (154 +/- 71 min) (p < 0.001). We developed an original system of isolated perfused heart allowing ex vivo study of HAR. HA delayed the occurrence of the HAR and confirmed the central role of the component in the HAR.
