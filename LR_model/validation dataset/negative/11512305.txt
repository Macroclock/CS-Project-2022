Organ transplantation in Latin America. Organ transplantation is currently a form of treatment for end-stage organ disease in Latin America for which enthusiasm appears to be growing both in individual countries as well as in the whole region. The Latin-American Transplant Registry has been a factor in the development of communication among the different countries of the region and a focus for unification. Both renal and extra-renal organ transplantation have increased significantly during 1999 and for kidneys the activity is currently 12% of the world renal transplant statistics. Important evidence for the continuing development and maturity of transplantation in the region includes the number of new transplantation societies, the increase in the number of renal and extra-renal transplant programs, the development of national organ transplant registries, efforts towards analyzing costs and administration in transplantation and the incorporation of new immunosuppressants. The development of cardiac transplantation in Bolivia, Cuba, Paraguay, Per√∫, Puerto Rico and Uruguay, intestinal transplantation in Argentina, and liver transplantation in Bolivia all reflect a marked interest in organ transplantation in the different countries. Similarly, liver and cardiac transplantation are increasing at a very fast rate. End-stage organ disease is recognized as a growing health priority and organ donation as a critical limiting factor. Governments are directly and indirectly supporting transplantation initiatives. The return of trained transplant practitioners to their countries of origin also accounts for part of the increase in activity and for the organizational aspects of transplantation. The statistics presented in this report signify increasing maturity in the transplantation activities of Latin America.
