[Intravascular ultrasound guided directional atherectomy and stent implantation of an unprotected main stem in a heart transplant patient with comorbidity]. Following orthotopic heart transplantation (HTx), development of transplant vasculopathy (TVP) is the limiting medical entity leading to significant morbidity and mortality beyond the first year after HTx. Selection of a suitable strategy for repeat revascularisation--transcatheter angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting or repeat HTx--depends on various parameters including coronary morphology, left ventricular performance, comorbidity, availability of graft material and donor organs. Catheter-based interventions on the main stem of the left coronary artery are feasible, but a relatively lower primary success rate and a higher complication rate and significantly increased mortality have to be expected. We report on a patient who underwent HTx 9 years ago and developed severe transplant vasculopathy revealing significant main stem stenosis, making reintervention necessary. Due to age, coronary artery morphology and comorbidity the patient was not considered for coronary artery bypass grafting or repeat HTx. We performed successful IVUS-guided directional coronary atherectomy and stent implantation on a distal stenosis of the unprotected main stem. Our case demonstrates a predictable procedural risk and favourable primary result of left main stem angioplasty procedures, thus providing a therapeutic option for patients who are poor candidates for operative revascularisation strategies.
