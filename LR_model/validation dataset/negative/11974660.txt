Magnetocardiography: current status and perspectives. Part II: Clinical applications. Magnetocardiography (MCG) is a non-invasive and risk-free technique allowing body surface recording of the magnetic fields generated by the electrical activity of the heart. The MCG recording system allows spatially and temporally accurate measurements of the very weak magnetic fields produced by currents flowing within myocardial fibers during cardiac activity. MCG has now been around for over 30 years, but only recently has progress in instrumentation put the technique on the verge of clinical applicability. This review summarizes the physical principles, instrumentation, main clinical applications and perspectives for the clinical use of MCG. This second part is devoted to the description of the main current clinical applications and perspectives.
