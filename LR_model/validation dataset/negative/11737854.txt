Contrast in the efficacy of hDAF mouse hearts between ex vivo perfusion and transplantation into primates. In recent experiments, in which we compared hDAF transgenic rat hearts perfused with 15% human serum in the Langendorff device and hDAF rat hearts transplanted into cynomolgus monkeys, we demonstrated that in the ex vivo heart perfusion model both homozygous and heterozygous hDAF hearts survived longer as nontransgenic controls. Surprisingly, we found that only homozygous hDAF hearts were protected against hyperacute rejection in vivo. The first aim of this study was to determine whether perfusion of mouse hearts with higher human serum concentrations or human blood might explain some of the differences found in survival time of the recently performed experiments with rat heart xenografts. Secondly, we investigated whether the observed differences in survival times of rat xenografts between in vivo and ex vivo transplantation would also hold for mouse hearts transgenic for hDAF. An ex vivo model was used to perfuse hDAF mouse hearts and controls with human serum or blood, and hDAF transgenic hearts and controls were transplanted into cynomolgus monkeys. hDAF transgenic mouse hearts survived significantly longer than their controls when perfused with 15% human serum, but no difference was found when 30% human serum was used, or when these hearts were transplanted into cynomolgus monkeys. However, in both the in vivo and ex vivo models the amount of PMNs adhering to the vascular endothelium was significantly lower in hDAF transgenes as compared with their controls. In conclusion, in the ex vivo situation, the efficacy of hDAF transgenesis in preventing HAR is limited by serum complement concentration.
