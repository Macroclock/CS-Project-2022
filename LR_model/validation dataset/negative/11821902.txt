Preimplantation-stage stem cells induce long-term allogeneic graft acceptance without supplementary host conditioning. Hematopoietic stem cells have been successfully employed for tolerance induction in a variety of rodent and large animal studies. However, clinical transplantation of fully allogeneic bone marrow or blood-borne stem cells is still associated with major obstacles, such as graft-versus-host disease or cytoreductive conditioning-related toxicity. Here we show that when rat embryonic stem cell-like cells of WKY origin are injected intraportally into fully MHC-mismatched DA rats, they engraft permanently (>150 days) without supplementary host conditioning. This deviation of a potentially alloreactive immune response sets the basis for long-term graft acceptance of second-set transplanted WKY cardiac allografts. Graft survival was strictly correlated with a state of mixed chimerism, which required functional thymic host competence. Our results provide a rationale for using preimplantation-stage stem cells as vehicles in gene therapy and for the induction of long-term graft acceptance.
