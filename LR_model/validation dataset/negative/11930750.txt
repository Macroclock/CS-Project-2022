[Relationship between expression of IL-1 beta mRNA and rejection of heart allograft]. To detect relationship between expression of IL-1 beta mRNA and allograft survival time. A simplified heterotopic heart transplantation model and a new reliable semi-quanitative RT-PCR technique were used. Inbred SD and Wistar rats were used as donors and recipients respectively in allogeneic transplantation. In synogeneic transplantation, both the donor and recipient were Wistar rats. Thirty allografts and thirty isografts were assessed daily by palpation to observe grafts' viability. In every time point, six allografts and six isografts were used to detect IL-1 beta mRNA expression. The allografts and isografts were harvested on postoperative days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. After the total RNA was prepared, the control primer and target primer were amplified in the same tube. The average ratio of the target products pixel volume to primer's was calculated, by which the coordinates chart was made to detect the expression level of IL-1 beta mRNA directly. The levels of the IL-1 beta mRNA expression in allografts were much higher than those in isografts. The peak of elevated level of the IL-1 beta mRNA expressions appeared on the 1st day post-transplantation 1st day, and prior to the peak of the allografts dead time. The experiment suggested that the IL-1 beta may play an important role in rejection of heart graft. The determination of IL-1 beta mRNA expression may serve as a useful immunologic monitoring protocol, and some administrations against IL-1 beta may be used to prevent and treat rejection.
