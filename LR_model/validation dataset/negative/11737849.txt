Hamster cardiac xenografts are protected against antibody mediated damage, early after transplantation to Lewis rats. Antibodies play a crucial role in the rejection of xenografts. We tested the hypothesis that xenografts are protected against antibody-mediated attack early after transplantation in a concordant model. We investigated the role of xenoreactive antibodies as a stimulus for protection and the effects of a total blockade of the antibody response by the leflunomide analog malononitrilamide 279. Hamster cardiac xenografts were transplanted to Lewis rat recipients. Second transplants and retransplants of xenografts were performed to untreated rats that had a xenograft in place for 3 d. Untreated rats rejected hamster cardiac xenografts after 4.0 +/- 0.0 d. Significant levels of anti-donor IgM, as measured by flowcytometry, were present on day 3 after transplantation (11.2% +/- 2.8 vs. 1.2% +/- 0.0 on day 0, P < 0.001). 'Fresh' second xenografts transplanted to rats that had a first xenograft in place for 3 d and had anti-hamster antibodies, underwent hyperacute rejection. The first xenografts remained functioning. Xenografts that were removed on day 3 from untreated rats and then retransplanted remained functioning. Xenografts that were removed on d 3 from rats that had been treated with malononitrilamide 279, 15 mg/kg/d and were retransplanted underwent hyperacute rejection. IgM levels at the time of removal were 1.1% +/- 0.5 in these rats and not different from baseline (P = 0.96). We conclude that xenografts are protected against antibody-mediated damage early after transplantation. The presence of anti-donor antibodies might be an essential stimulus for the induction of protection. There seems to be a delicate balance between the injurious and protective effects of antibodies. Treatment strategies that are designed to block antibody formation completely might prevent the induction of protection.
