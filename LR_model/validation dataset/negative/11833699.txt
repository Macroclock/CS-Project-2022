The Novacor left ventricular assist system: clinical experience from the Novacor registry. The electrically powered Novacor left ventricular assist (LVAS) system was first used clinically as a bridge to transplant in 1984. The configuration has evolved to the current wearable model used clinically for the first time in 1993. In 1998, the inflow conduit was modified, reducing embolic events by 50%. Over 1100 implants have been performed worldwide with cumulative support greater than 300 patient years, and only 0.7% requiring replacement. The Novacor is a safe and effective device for bridge to transplant, bridge to recovery, or potentially permanent implant with reliable long-term support for periods as long as 4 years.
