A ruthenium (III) polyaminocarboxylate complex, a novel nitric oxide scavenger, enhances graft survival and decreases nitrosylated heme protein in models of acute and delayed cardiac transplant rejection. Nitric oxide (NO) derived from the up-regulation of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) is believed to play an important role in organ rejection. In experimental models of acute cardiac transplant rejection (i.e., without immunosuppression), treatment using NOS inhibitors to prevent acute rejection have yielded conflicting results. This is most likely due to potential inhibition of constitutive NOS. Accordingly, agents that trap NO directly may have some advantage. In the current study, we evaluated the actions of a ruthenium-based NO scavenger, AMD6221, to inhibit the nitrosylation of myocardial protein and to prolong cardiac allograft survival in a model of acute cardiac transplant rejection (without immunosuppression). In addition, we evaluated the efficacy of AMD6221 used in combination with low-dose cyclosporine (CsA) (i.e., a model of delayed graft rejection). Heterotopic abdominal cardiac transplantation was performed using rat strains with disparities at major and minor histocompatibility loci. Grafts were harvested on postoperative day 6 for histologic examination or analysis of myocardial protein nitrosylation using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Other animals were monitored twice daily to determine rejection times. Plasma was also taken at postoperative day 6 for determining the concentration of NO by-products (nitrate plus nitrite). Treatment with AMD6221 either prolonged graft survival and/or caused a marked decrease in myocardial nitrosylprotein formation as determined by EPR spectroscopy. In vivo scavenging of NO by AMD6221 was verified by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of nitrosylated-drug in plasma samples. Low-dose CsA given alone or in combination with AMD6221 completely blocked formation of myocardial nitrosylprotein complexes. Whereas low-dose CsA alone prolonged graft survival, combination therapy with CsA plus AMD6221 produced a synergistic effect on graft survival. These studies indicate that treatment with a ruthenium-based NO scavenger, such as AMD6221, may be an effective regimen used alone or in combination with CsA to protect myocardial proteins from posttranscriptional modification and to prolong cardiac graft survival.
