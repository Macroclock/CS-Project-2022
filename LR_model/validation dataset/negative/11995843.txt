Profulla Kumar Sen: his contributions to cardiovascular surgery. One of the most eminent cardiothoracic surgeons of India, Profulla Kumar Sen (1915-1982) had a keen interest in research and in the subsequent clinical application of knowledge gained in the laboratory. His most significant contributions are his pioneering work on a transmyocardial acupuncture technique for treatment of ischemic myocardium, on heart transplantation in canine models and later in human beings, and on a new technique for aortic arch replacement. Transmyocardial laser revascularization of the 1990s was but an extension of his mechanical myocardial acupuncture for the treatment of ischemic heart disease, which he introduced 30 years earlier. On 16 February 1968, after many years of preparation through work with animal models, P.K. Sen and his team performed the 1st cardiac transplantation in India and the 6th in the world.
