Functional restitution of cardiac control in heart transplant patients. Cardiovascular control is fundamentally altered after heart transplantation (HT) because of surgical denervation of the heart. The main goal of this work was the noninvasive characterization of cardiac rate control mechanisms after HT and the understanding of their nature. We obtained 25 recordings from 13 male HT patients [age = 28-68 yr, time after transplant (TAT) = 0.5-62.5 mo]. The control group included 14 healthy men (age = 28-59 yr). Electrocardiogram, continuous blood pressure (BP), and respiration were recorded for 45 min in the supine position and then during active change of posture (CP) to standing. The signals were analyzed in the time domain [mean and variance of heart rate (HR) and rise time of HR in response to CP] and the frequency domain [low and high frequency (LF and HF)]. Our principal finding was the consistent pattern of evolution of the HR response to standing: from no response, via a slow response (>40 s, TAT > 6 wk), to a fast increase (<20 s, TAT > 24 mo). HR response correlated with TAT (P < 0.001). LF correlated with HR response to CP (P < 0.0001); HF and HR did not. An important finding was the presence of very-high-frequency peaks in the power spectrum of HR and BP fluctuations. Extensive arrhythmias tended to appear at the TAT that corresponds to the transition from slow to fast HR response to CP. Our results indicate a biphasic evolution in cardiac control mechanisms from lack of control to a first-order control loop followed by partial sympathetic reinnervation and, finally, the direct effect of the old sinoatrial node on the pacemaker cell of the new sinoatrial node. There was no indication of vagal reinnervation.
