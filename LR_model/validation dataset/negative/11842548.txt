[Transportation for a pediatric heart transplant candidate to Germany]. A 8-year-old girl who underwent a total cavopulmonary connection as an one-staged repair for tricuspid atresia (Ic) had had a progressive dilated cardiomyopathy. Despite of any medical support, her left ventricular ejection fraction had been ranged from 10% to 20% since 4 months after Fontan operation. This patient was decided to apply for a heart transplantation in Germany 17 months after Fontan operation. An administration of the sufficient amount of inotropics and oxygen, volume resuscitation, reduction of the peripheral circulation at the time of take-off, and a meticulous monitoring may contribute to the successful transportation of the critically ill patient.
