Redo- extirpation of a cardiac leiomyosarcoma to avoid transplantation. Cardiac leiomyosarcoma is a very rare entity that is found in less than 0.2 % of all cardiac tumors. At the time of primary diagnosis, it often shows advanced local invasion or may even be metastasized. Thus, complete resection can not easily be achieved. Cardiac transplantation has been reported as a therapeutic option. Here, we report on a case of a leiomyosarcoma reoccurrence arising 2 years after initial surgery. We performed a radical redo-extirpation without the necessity of transplantation.
