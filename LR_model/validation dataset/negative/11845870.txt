Late cardiac reoperation after cardiac transplantation. The intermediate and long-term results of cardiac transplantation continue to improve. Subsequent cardiac procedures may be required to extend patient survival and protect graft function. The medical records of all adult and pediatric cardiac transplant recipients who underwent a subsequent cardiac procedure at our institution were reviewed. Three hundred sixty patients have undergone primary orthotopic transplantation in our institution. Seventeen patients (12 adults, 5 children) underwent a subsequent procedure requiring cardiopulmonary bypass including cardiac retransplantation (10), coronary artery bypass grafting (3), ascending aortic replacement (2), tricuspid valve repair (1), and myotomy and myomectomy (1 patient). Mean interval from time of transplantation to second procedure was 8.3 years. There was one perioperative death. Two patients, both retransplants, died late postoperatively at 22 and 84 months, respectively. Overall mean follow-up in the late survivors is 26.6 months. All survivors are currently asymptomatic and doing well. A variety of subsequent cardiac procedures, in addition to retransplantation, can be performed safely in carefully selected cardiac transplant recipients. The intermediate term results are gratifying in terms of survival and freedom from symptoms.
