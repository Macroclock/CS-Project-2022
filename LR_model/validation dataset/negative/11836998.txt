[Transplantation of embryonic myocardium in animal experiments]. The work presents the results of experimental transplantation of a not-divided embryonic myocardium culture into the mesentery of the adult rats' intestine for the terms of about 30 days. The influence of Cimitidine--cardiolen on the development of this culture was investigated. The grafts were shown to be taken and to function well and the use of cardiolen reliably improves the development of the culture.
