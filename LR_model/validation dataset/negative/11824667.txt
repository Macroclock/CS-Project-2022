Update on the total artificial heart. There has been a quest for an artificial organ that can replace the heart for decades. Remarkable advances were made in the second half of the twentieth century in the fields of medicine and engineering that led to the development of several devices with the intention of totally replacing the human heart. Some of these devices, like the Jarvik artificial heart, were utilized initially as a permanent replacement for the failing heart. It became more successful as a bridge to heart transplantation (BTT) in the years that followed its introduction. Currently the CardioWest total artificial heart (TAH) is the only device in clinical use with the intention of bridging patients to heart transplantation. Two new TAHs are being developed with the intention of being used as an alternative to transplantation (ATT) or on a permanent basis. The next 100 years will bring revolutionary new designs and advances in the field of end stage heart disease that may only be ideas at the present time.
