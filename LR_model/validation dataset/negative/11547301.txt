Combined heart-kidney transplantation with single-donor allografts. Combined heart-kidney transplantation with allografts from the same donor has been long proved to be a feasible approach for selected patients with coexisting end-stage cardiomyopathy and renal disease. The purpose of this retrospective study is to analyze our long-term results and compare these results with heart-only transplantation over a 7-year period. Between June 1992 and April 1999, 10 patients underwent combined heart-kidney transplantation at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. They were all men from 44 to 70 years old (mean age, 59 +/- 8.3 years) who had a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 19.4% +/- 5.0% (range, 9%-25%) and a mean creatinine clearance of 25.4 mL/min (range, 10-39 mL/min). Four patients underwent pretransplantation dialysis. There was no operative mortality. The actuarial survival at 1, 2, and 5 years was 100%, 88% +/- 11.7%, and 55% +/- 20.1%, respectively. By comparison, the operative mortality of 169 patients who underwent heart-only transplantation during the same time interval was 2.4%, with an actuarial survival at 1, 2, and 5 years of 92% +/- 2.1%, 84% +/- 2.8%, and 71% +/- 3.9%, respectively (P =.37). Eight patients showed no evidence of significant (> or =1B) cardiac allograft rejection postoperatively, and the actuarial freedom from rejection at 30 days, 1 year, and 2 years was 90% +/- 9%, 80% +/- 13%, and 80% +/- 13%, respectively. Renal allograft survival was 90% at 1 and 2 years. Combined heart-kidney transplantation yields satisfactory long-term results similar to those for heart-only transplantation, with a low incidence of cardiac allograft rejection and renal allograft survival when both allografts are from the same donor. This approach effectively expands the selection criteria for heart-only and kidney-only transplantation in potential candidates with coexisting end-stage cardiac and renal disease.
