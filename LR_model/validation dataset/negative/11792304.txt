[Anesthesia for heart transplantation]. This review covers the management of patients proposed for heart transplantation from the moment of preoperative assessment. Drug treatments that provide a bridge to transplantation are emphasized, with mention of traditional drugs such as dobutamine, more recent agents such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and finally new drugs such as levosimendan. Mechanical support devices and indications for their use leading to transplantation are discussed. Finally, the notion of xenotransplantation is mentioned as a possible solution to the imbalance between supply and demand for transplantable organs.
