Immunologic events and long-term survival after combined heart and kidney transplantation: a 12-year single-center experience. In this study we compare the incidence of cardiac rejection and long-term survival after combined heart and kidney transplantation (HK) and single heart transplantation (H). Combined HK transplantation is a surgical option for patients with irreversible cardiac and renal failure. However, long-term results of combined HK transplantation on immunologic events and patient survival remain unknown. Between 1988 and 1997, 12 consecutive patients underwent combined HK transplantation (HK group) at a single institution. A control group (H group) of 24 single heart transplant recipients operated on within the same period was matched for age, pre-operative pulmonary vascular resistance, hepatic insufficiency and gender mismatch. Recipients and donors were ABO compatible without HLA antigen matching. All patients received immediate triple immunosuppression that included cyclosporine. Because of early renal dysfunction, cyclosporine was switched to anti-thymocyte globulin in 5 patients from the HK group and in 1 patient from the H group (p = 0.01). Actuarial freedom from heart rejection at 6 months and at 1 year following transplantation averaged 90 +/- 9% and 70 +/- 14% in the HK group, and 65 +/- 10% and 49 +/- 11% in the H group, respectively (p = 0.023). Actuarial survival at 1, 5 and 12 years was not significantly different between groups, at 66%, 55% and 28% in the HK group, and 66%, 44% and 32% in the H group, respectively (p = 0.66). The incidence of cardiac rejection was significantly lower. Long-term survival in the HK group was similar to that in the H group. Putative mechanisms of decreased cardiac rejection in the HK group include allogeneic stimulation, donor-derived dendritic cells and induction by anti-thymocyte globulins. The need for long-term immunosuppression may be reduced after combined heart and kidney transplantation.
