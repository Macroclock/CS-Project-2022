[Growth and pubertal development following pediatric heart transplantation]. Prospective study of growth and pubertal development following pediatric heart transplantation in 25 children. Twenty-five children underwent orthotopic cardiac transplantation at Ste-Justine Hospital from July 1984 to August 1996. Systematic evaluation of anthropometric parameters (weight, height, bone age), hormonal profile (LH, FSH, testosterone, oestradiol, DHEAS), and pubertal development according to Marshall and Tanner were done yearly. Six patients had severe growth retardation at transplantation and only one patient was obese. All patients showed normal height increment following cardiac transplantation. Only 3 patients will not reach genetic target height. The 6 children suffering from congenital cardiomyopathy and showing severe growth delay before surgery did not show any significant catch up growth. Significant weight gain was observed during the first post-operative year (113 +/- 27% ideal body weight p = 0.0002) with evolution towards normal values at 2 years (100 +/- 18%). Thirteen patients were in the prepubertal stage at the time of transplant. Since then, one girl had her menarche at 11 years of age and 3 boys started their pubertal onset at 12 years old. The elevation of blood gonadotrophins during pubertal development correlated with progression of secondary sexual characteristics in both sexes. This pediatric population showed normal growth and normal onset and progression of puberty following cardiac transplantation. However, no catch-up growth was observed. The most important factor influencing attainment of maximal growth potential following heart transplantation was the degree of staturoponderal growth retardation at the time of surgery.
