Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder: manifestations in pediatric thoracic organ recipients. To describe and correlate the clinical and imaging features of posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in young thoracic organ transplant recipients. The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical and imaging records of 31 PTLD episodes in 27 patients with PTLD out of 183 young patients who survived for at least 1 month after thoracic organ transplantation: 18 (14%) heart transplant recipients and nine (16%) lung or heart-lung transplant recipients. Four patients had two separate PTLD episodes. The distribution, timing, and imaging features of the disease were analyzed. Seventeen (55%) of 31 episodes involved intrathoracic PTLD manifesting as multiple pulmonary nodules (n = 10), a solitary nodule (n = 3), alveolar consolidation (n = 3), and/or mediastinal adenopathy (n = 8). Extrathoracic PTLD occurred in 21 (68%) of 31 episodes and involved the abdomen (n = 15), head and neck (n = 11), and/or central nervous system (n = 3). The imaging findings of these episodes included bowel wall thickening, lymphadenopathy, and focal masses. Intrathoracic PTLD occurred more commonly in lung transplant recipients (89%) than in heart transplant recipients (44%); no cases of lymphoma involved the thorax. The frequency of extrathoracic manifestations was higher in heart transplant recipients (83%) than in lung transplant recipients (33%). In lung transplant recipients, the prevalence of early-onset PTLD was significantly greater than that in heart transplant recipients (P <.05). Intrathoracic PTLD tended to manifest early. PTLD in young thoracic transplant recipients involves the lungs and extrathoracic organs, tends to have an early onset, and manifests predominantly in the thorax in lung transplant and heart-lung transplant recipients, as opposed to heart transplant recipients.
