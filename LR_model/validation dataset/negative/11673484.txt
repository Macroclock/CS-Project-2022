T cell subsets and in vitro immune regulation in "infectious" transplantation tolerance. CD4-targeted mAb therapy results in permanent acceptance of cardiac allografts in rat recipients, in conjunction with features of the infectious tolerance pathway. Although CD4(+) T cells play a central role, the actual cellular and molecular tolerogenic mechanisms remain elusive. This study was designed to analyze in vitro alloimmune responses of T lymphocytes from CD4 mAb-treated engrafted hosts. Spleen, but not lymph node, cells lost proliferative response against donor alloantigen in MLR and suppressed test allograft rejection in adoptive transfer studies, suggesting compartmentalization of tolerogenic T cells in transplant recipients. A high dose of exogenous IL-2 restored the allogeneic response of tolerogenic T cells, indicating anergy as a putative mechanism. Vigorous proliferation of the tolerogenic T cells in in vivo MLR supports the existence of alloreactive lymphocytes in tolerogenic T cell repertoire and implies an active operational suppression mechanism. The tolerogenic splenocytes suppressed proliferation of naive splenocytes in vitro, consistent with their in vivo property of dominant immune regulation. Finally, CD45RC(+) but not CD45RC(-) T cells from tolerant hosts were hyporesponsive to alloantigen and suppressed the proliferation of normal T cells in the coculture assay. Thus, nondeletional, anergy-like regulatory mechanisms may operate via CD4(+)CD45RC(+) T cells in the infectious tolerance pathway in transplant recipients.
