Chronopharmacology of oral prednisolone in rats. The chronopharmacology of oral prednisolone (PSL) was studied in rat models. Differences in the dosing-time-dependent toxicity were evaluated at four time points (3, 9, 15 and 21 HALO) in adult male Wistar rats and confirmed in an inbred strain of Lewis rats (MHC haplotype; RTIl) at two time points (9 and 21 HALO). The total body weight and that of the immunologic-related organs were maximally reduced when PSL was repeatedly administered during the late active phase (21 HALO). This chronotoxicity was independent of plasma concentrations of PSL, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and corticosterone. Repeated administration of PSL prolonged cardiac allograft survival in a DA (RTIa) -to-Lewis combination, and there was a tendency to be more effective in the 21 HALO trial. These results suggested that single dose therapy of PSL at the selected point of the day may be less harmful, protecting against allograft rejection.
