Revascularization of the occluded right coronary artery during left ventricular assist device implantation. A 62-year-old man with end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular function of 20% was evaluated for heart transplantation. Cardiac catheterization revealed proximal occlusion of the dominant right coronary artery (RCA) with collateral blood flow and significant stenosis in the distal part, but no significant re-occlusions of the stented left coronary artery and no significant stenosis of the left circumflex artery. When the patient became catecholamine dependent, Novacor left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation, as a bridge to transplantation, was considered and the patient operated upon. To avoid ischemic right heart failure after LVAD implantation, a concomitant re-vascularization of the distal RCA was performed. The post-operative course was uneventful. Five weeks later, a control angiogram showed the patent bypass graft. The distal stenosis of the RCA was treated successfully with dilation and stent implantation. The patient is presently in stable condition on LVAD and awaits transplantation as an outpatient.
