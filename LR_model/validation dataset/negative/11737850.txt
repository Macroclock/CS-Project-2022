Pre-transplant blood transfusion induces tolerance to hamster cardiac xenografts in athymic nude rats. The effects of pre-transplant blood transfusion vary from induction of antibodies and accelerated graft rejection, to prolonged survival and even tolerance. The beneficial 'transfusion effect' in allotransplantation is believed to be merely T-cell mediated. In xenotransplantation, T-cell independent mechanisms form a major hurdle. In this study we investigated the effects of pre-transplant hamster blood transfusion on the survival of hamster cardiac xenografts in T-cell deficient athymic nude rats. Nude rats rejected xenografts after 3.8 +/- 0.5 d (n = 8), and immunocompetent Lewis rats after 4.0 +/- 0.5 d (n = 8), following a similar IgM response (P = NS). Hamster blood transfusion 3 d before transplantation in nude rats led to an IgM response and long-term xenograft survival in 17/20. Timing was of importance: blood transfusion 7 d before transplantation resulted in 45% long-term xenograft survival (n = 20). Injection of purified hamster erythrocytes, leukocytes or minced heart also led to survival of xenografts for > 100 d in nude rats, but not in all cases. Second xenografts transplanted to long-term survivors did not provoke an IigM response, and were accepted for > 100 d (n = 4). Transfer of serum from long-term survivors to untreated nude rats resulted in survival of xenografts for > 100 d (n = 4). In Lewis rats pre-transplant blood transfusion induced hyperacute rejection of xenografts after 158 +/- 128 min (n = 8, P < 0.01). We conclude that pre-transplant hamster blood transfusion can induce long-term survival of hamster cardiac xenografts in T-cell deficient athymic nude rats. This blood transfusion effect is mediated by humoral factors and can be transferred by serum. Elucidation of underlying mechanisms might provide some insight into xenotransplantation nonresponsiveness of T-cell independent immunefactors.
