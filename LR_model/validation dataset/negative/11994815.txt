Importance of physical rehabilitation before and after cardiac transplantation in a patient with myotonic dystrophy: a case report. Patients with muscular dystrophy and concomitant cardiomyopathy are only reluctantly accepted for heart transplantation because of the perioperative risk secondary to respiratory muscle weakness. We describe a man with Steinert's disease (myotonic dystrophy) who received a cardiac allograft because of end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy. This case shows the importance of uninterrupted physiotherapeutic training and assistance to minimize respiratory infections and ventilatory insufficiency in patients with muscle diseases under high-dose immunosuppression. To our knowledge, this is the first heart transplantation reported in a patient with Steinert's disease who has clinically overt muscular impairment.
