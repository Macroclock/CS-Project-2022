Heart transplantation changes the expression of distinct gene families. We took advantage of the combination of a rat heart transplantation model with a modified differential display RT-PCR method to identify transcriptome changes in the right atria from transplanted compared with native hearts. Based on sequence homology search, the 37 cDNAs differentially displayed both 2 and 7 days posttransplantation were categorized into 7 unknown transcripts, 16 expressed sequence tags (ESTs), and 14 partially or completely characterized genes. The last group cDNAs, validated by relative RT-PCR, belonged to diverse gene families involved in specific metabolisms, protein synthesis, cell signaling, and transcription. Furthermore, we identified differential transcripts corresponding to denervation and fetal gene reexpression. We found coordinate downregulation of genes involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis regulation, similar to that reported for senescent skeletal muscle. From these transcriptome changes, we propose that heart transplants and senescent muscles share common molecular mechanisms.
