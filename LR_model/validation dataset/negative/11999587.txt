Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders: T-cell lymphoma following cardiac transplant. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) are a frequently fatal complication occurring after transplant. The majority of cases are of B-cell origin but a smaller percentage of cases are of T-cell origin. The etiology of these disorders is unclear, however, EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) in the context of immunosuppression is thought to play a role, particularly in B-cell PTLD. We report a case of T-cell PTLD limited to the bone marrow occurring eight years post-cardiac transplantation and review the literature on T-cell PTLD after heart transplant.
