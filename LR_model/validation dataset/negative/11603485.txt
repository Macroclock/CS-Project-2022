Modification of bicaval anastomosis technique for orthotopic heart transplantation. A modified bicaval anastomosis technique was utilized for 4 consecutive patients undergoing heart transplantation. Instead of transecting the superior and inferior vena cavae, a strip of the posterior right atrial wall was left undivided as a bridge connecting the superior and inferior vena cavae. This minor modification perfectly prevented shrinkage and retraction of the caval tissue, thus providing easier anastomotic orientation and better estimation of the appropriate tissue length that fits well, particularly when a small donor heart was available.
