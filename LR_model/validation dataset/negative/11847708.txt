Peripherally inserted central catheters in the patient with cardiomyopathy. The most cost-effective venous acess. While waiting for a heart transplant, patients with cardiomyopathy receive positive inotropic agents and other medications that require ongoing venous access. To evaluate the cost effectiveness of bedside peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement, a retrospective analysis was conducted comparing four types of venous access. Almost 4000 dwell days support the premise that bedside PICC placement is the most cost-effective method of providing ongoing venous access to the patient with cardiomyopathy.
