[Current status of lung transplantation: patients, indications, techniques and outcome]. Lung transplantation has evolved to a standard treatment modality for patients suffering from end-stage lung diseases. Accepted indications for lung transplantation include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of the lung (COPD) and other causes of emphysema (i.e., alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency), parenchymal diseases (i.e., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, vascular diseases (i.e., primary pulmonary hypertension), chronic infectious diseases (i.e., bronchiectasis), as well as rare indications such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis or sarcoidosis.
