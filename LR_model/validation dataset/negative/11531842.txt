Sporotrichoid phaeohyphomycosis due to Alternaria infectoria. We describe a cardiac transplant patient who had human cutaneous alternariosis with a sporotrichoid distribution of skin lesions. In this patient identification of the causative organism Alternaria infectoria was achieved by sequencing the rDNA internal transcribed spacer domain. Treatment with itraconazole led to clinical resolution within 4 months.
