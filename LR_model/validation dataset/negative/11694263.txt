Provision of laboratory services for heart and lung transplantation in Australia. Laboratory services for the support of heart and lung transplantation in Australia have adapted to the special needs of the clinicians looking after the heart and lung transplantation patients. Pre-transplantation standardized tests encompassing a wide variety of different parameters are carried out both to establish the suitability of patients for a transplant and to maximize the chance of success following this procedure. Potential solid organ recipients routinely have blood samples sent to a number of centers Australia-wide so that human leukocyte antigen (HLA) presensitization can be checked for at the time a donor becomes available in any state in Australia. Although prospective HLA matching is not performed for thoracic organ transplant recipients, pre-existing antibodies to donor HLA antigens are a contra-indication to transplantation. Following transplantation, the predominant roles of the laboratory are in the monitoring of immunosuppressive drug levels, in the detection of allograft rejection, and in the detection of bacterial infection or viral reactivation. While a number of markers have been proposed in the detection of rejection, we currently rely on interpretation of the histological analysis of biopsies. The treatment with immune suppressive agents, in particular cyclosporin A, has made organ transplantation from non-HLA identical donors possible. As cyclosporin A and other immune suppressive drugs have significant side effects, their concentrations need to be carefully followed to guarantee sufficient immune suppression while avoiding renal failure and other complications including excessive immunosuppression and infectious disease risk. Recently, the role of viral reactivation with the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has attained more prominence. HCMV is a potential pathogen in up to 90% of thoracic organ transplant recipients and in the pre-gancyclovir era, it was a major cause of morbidity and mortality in at-risk lung transplant recipients. New PCR-based assays that measure the viral load levels of HCMV allow earlier intervention and more appropriate treatment strategies to prevent the HCMV disease syndromes and optimize the HCMV prophylaxis strategy. Diagnostic pathology testing to support heart and lung transplantation is a combination of routine testing and specialized testing. Depending on the time-critical nature of the tests, this testing has to be done on site or in more centralized testing facilities. Further developments in the laboratory support of heart and lung transplantation will hopefully continue to improve both the short- and long-term outcomes of thoracic organ transplant recipients.
