Treatment of vascular thrombosis with enoxaparin in orthotopic heart transplant patients during the early postoperative period. Management of anti-coagulation in the early period after orthotopic heart transplantation, when the frequency of invasive procedures to assess for graft rejection is high, presents a difficult clinical problem in which the need for effective therapy must be weighed against the desire for outpatient treatment. In this report, we summarize the clinical course and long-term outcome of 6 patients from our center in whom vascular thrombosis was treated on an outpatient basis with enoxaparin. We conclude that the use of enoxaparin may provide a safe and reasonable alternative to conventional anti-coagulation therapy during this period.
