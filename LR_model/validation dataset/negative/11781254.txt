Selective inhibitor of Janus tyrosine kinase 3, PNU156804, prolongs allograft survival and acts synergistically with cyclosporine but additively with rapamycin. Janus kinase 3 (Jak3) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine (Tyr) kinase associated with the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor common gamma chain (gamma(c)) that is activated by multiple T-cell growth factors (TCGFs) such as IL-2, -4, and -7. Using human T cells, it was found that a recently discovered variant of the undecylprodigiosin family of antibiotics, PNU156804, previously shown to inhibit IL-2-induced cell proliferation, also blocks IL-2-mediated Jak3 auto-tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of Jak3 substrates signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) 5a and Stat5b, and extracellular regulated kinase 1 (Erk1) and Erk2 (p44/p42). Although PNU156804 displayed similar efficacy in blocking Jak3-dependent T-cell proliferation by IL-2, -4, -7, or -15, it was more than 2-fold less effective in blocking Jak2-mediated cell growth, its most homologous Jak family member. A 14-day alternate-day oral gavage with 40 to 120 mg/kg PNU156804 extended the survival of heart allografts in a dose-dependent fashion. In vivo, PNU156804 acted synergistically with the signal 1 inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA) and additively with the signal 3 inhibitor rapamycin to block allograft rejection. It is concluded that inhibition of signal 3 alone by targeting Jak3 in combination with a signal 1 inhibitor provides a unique strategy to achieve potent immunosuppression.
