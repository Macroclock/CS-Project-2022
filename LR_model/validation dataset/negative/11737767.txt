Cardiorespiratory functional assessment after pediatric heart transplantation. Limited data are available on the exercise capacity of young heart transplant recipients. The aim of this study was therefore to assess cardiorespiratory responses to exercise in this group of patients. Fourteen consecutive heart transplant recipients (six girls and eight boys, age-range 5-15 yr) and 14 healthy matched controls underwent a Bruce treadmill test to determine: duration of test; resting and maximum heart rates; maximum systolic blood pressure; peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak); and cardiac output. Duration of test and heart rate increase were then compared with: time since transplantation, rejections per year, and immunosuppressive drugs received. The recipients also underwent the following lung function tests: forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1). When compared with healthy controls, transplant recipients had tachycardia at rest (126 +/- 3.7 beats/min; p < 0.001); significantly reduced tolerance (9.3 +/- 0.4 min; p < 0.001), a maximum heart rate of 169 +/- 5.4 beats/min (p < 0.05); a cardiac output of 5.65 +/- 0.6 L/min (p < 0.05); and a lower heart-rate increase from rest to peak exercise (p < 0.001) but a similar VO2 peak. The heart-rate increase correlated significantly with time post-transplant (r = 0.55; p < 0.05), number of rejection episodes per year (r = - 0.63; p < 0.05), and number of immunosuppressive drugs (r = - 0.60; p < 0.05). The recipients had normal FVC and FEV1 values. After surgery, few heart transplant recipients undertake physical activity, possibly owing to over-protective parents and teachers and to a lack of suitable supervised facilities. The authors stress the importance of a cardiorespiratory functional evaluation for assessment of health status and to encourage recipients, if possible, to undertake regular physical activity.
