Should moderate acute rejection of a cardiac transplant graft be treated? Histologically proven, moderate acute rejection after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) is commonly treated with intravenous steroids. This regimen may result in severe metabolic and infectious side-effects. The purpose of this study was to assess and compare outcomes in treated (T) versus not treated (N-T) biopsy proven 3A rejection episodes in cardiac transplant recipients. A retrospective analysis was conducted to identify all biopsy proven 3A rejection episodes that occurred over the time period 1995-2000 in patients (patients) >or= 6 months after OHT (n=48 episodes in 35 patients). Of the 48 episodes, 19 were N-T and 29 were T. Decision to treat 3A rejection was based on time after transplant, haemodynamic and/or clinical compromise and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction measured by 2D echo. Most N-T episodes received an increase in background immunotherapy. Time from transplant to index 3A episode in N-T patients was 4.2 versus 2.7 yr for the T patients (p=0.06). There were no differences seen between T and N-T groups for the first and second post-3A biopsy results or LV function post-3A. Presence of coronary disease or death were not different between groups. Of the 29 patients with T episodes, no differences in outcomes (death, first and second post-3A biopsy score, coronary disease, myocardial infarction, or LV function) were seen based on use of treatment with intravenous versus oral steroid. In patients more than 6 month after OHT, there were no differences in outcomes (ongoing rejection or LV function) between N-T episodes of 3A rejection and T episodes. In T patients the use of oral steroids was equally as effective for treatment of 3A episodes as intravenous steroids.
