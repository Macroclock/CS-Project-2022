[The effect of Chinese cobra venom factor on guinea pig to rat cardiac xenotransplantation]. In the guinea pig-to-rat cardiac xenotransplantation model, the effect of complement depletion by using Chinese Cobra Venom Factor(CVF) on hyperacute rejection was evaluated. Cardiac xenograft from guinea pig was transplanted into the abdomen of rat after the recipient being given i.p. a dose of CVF 0.20 microgram/g. the recipients were divided into group A (control group), group B (only given CVF), group C (CVF + Cytoxan + Splenectomy), group D (Cytoxan + Splenectomy) Cytoxan was injected into the abdominal cavity with a dose of 60 mg/Kg. The survival time of xenograft was measured and histologic observation was carried out after the cardiac arrest. The survival time of xenograft ranged from 15 to 3,120 minutes. There were significant difference among group A compared with group B and C (P < 0.01), and no difference between group A and group D, as well as group B and C (P > 0.05). There were significant difference between group B and D, as well as group C and D(P < 0.01). The histologic observation proved that the hyperacute rejection in group A and D was milder than group B and C. The study reveals that CVF can prolong the xenograft time by depleting complement activities and restricting hyperacute rejection in this model. Further basic and clinical study of effect of CVF in xenograft transplantation is worthwhile.
