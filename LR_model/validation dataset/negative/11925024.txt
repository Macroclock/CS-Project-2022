The immunological hurdles to cardiac xenotransplantation. The main hurdle to clinical application of cardiac xenotransplantation is the immune response of the recipient against the graft. Although all xenografts arouse an intense immune response, the effect of that response depends very much on whether the graft consists of isolated cells or an intact organ, such as the heart. Intact organs, which are transplanted by primary vascular anastomosis, are subject to severe vascular injury owing to the reaction of immune elements with the endothelial lining of donor blood vessels. Vascular injury leads to hyperacute rejection, acute vascular rejection, and chronic rejection. The immunological basis for these types of rejection and potential therapies, which might be used to avert them, are discussed.
