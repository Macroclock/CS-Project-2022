[Treatment of chronic heart failure in the child]. Medical therapy for chronic heart failure has recently been extensively revised on the basis of a reduction of mortality in randomized trials. However, there are almost no available trials in children whose treatment for heart failure is adapted from what is known in adults. Digitalis play a role in heart rate variability but there is no evidence for an effect on mortality. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors lead to an improvement of left ventricular function and reduces mortality; in addition, they are well tolerated in children. Diuretics are useful in congestive heart failure but chronic administration may have deleterious effects. Beta-blocking agents reduce mortality and improve symptoms and the ejection fraction; however, they must be given cautiously and the up-titration phase must be very progressive. New promising drugs are emerging (calcium sensitizers, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, angiotensin receptor [AT1] blockers) but at the present time their use in chronic heart failure has not proven to be efficient.
