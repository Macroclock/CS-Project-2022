Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: current diagnostic and management strategies. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a heart muscle disease of unknown etiology characterized by the peculiar right ventricular (RV) involvement. Distinctive pathologic features are myocardial atrophy and fibro-fatty replacement of the RV free wall, and clinical presentation is usually related to ventricular tachycardias with a left bundle branch block pattern or ventricular fibrillation leading to cardiac arrest, mostly in young people and athletes. Later in the disease evolution, progression and extension of RV muscle disease and left ventricular involvement may result in right or biventricular heart failure. The diagnosis of ARVC may be difficult because of several problems with specificity of ECG abnormalities, different potential etiologies of ventricular arrhythmias with a left bundle branch morphology, assessment of RV structure and function, and interpretation of endomyocardial biopsy findings. Therefore, standardized diagnostic criteria have been proposed by the Study Group on ARVC of the European Society of Cardiology. According to these guidelines, the diagnosis of ARVC is based on the presence of major and minor criteria encompassing electrocardiographic, arrhythmic, morphofunctional, histopathologic, and genetic factors. Since the assessment of sudden death risk in patients with ARVC is still not well established, there are no precise guidelines to determine which patients need to be treated and what is the best management approach. The therapeutic options include beta-blockers, antiarrhythmic drugs, catheter ablation, and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). The ICD is the most effective safeguard against arrhythmic sudden death. However, its precise role in changing the natural history of ARVC by preventing sudden and nonsudden death needs to be evaluated by a prospective study of a large series of patients. In patients in whom ARVC has progressed to severe RV or biventricular systolic dysfunction with risk of thromboembolic complications, treatment consists of current therapy for heart failure including anticoagulant therapy. In cases of refractory congestive heart failure, patients may become candidates for heart transplantation.
