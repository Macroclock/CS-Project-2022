Myocardial scintigraphy correlates poorly with coronary angiography in the screening of transplant arteriosclerosis. Coronary angiography remains an important screening tool for transplant coronary arteriosclerosis (TxCAD) after heart transplantation despite criticism that it underestimates the incidence of TxCAD. In an effort to improve TxCAD incidence estimation, several methods of screening have been proposed. In the present study, the incidence of TxCAD assessed by both yearly coronary angiography and stress myocardial scintigraphy imaging was reviewed. Ninety-nine consecutive primary heart transplantations were performed from 1988 to 1999. The standard immunosuppression protocol consisted of the introduction of antilymphocyte globulin and steroids, while maintenance therapy was with cyclosporine, imuran and steroids. Coronary angiography and a stress 2-methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile perfusion scan were performed yearly. TxCAD was defined by angiographic evidence of luminal abnormality by catheterization, or a perfusion abnormality at rest or after stress on myocardial scintigraphy. The mean recipient age was 49+/-12 years and the mean donor age was 33+/-13 years. The etiology of heart failure was ischemic cardiomyopathy (50%), dilated cardiomyopathy (41%) and congenital heart disease (9%). The freedom from angiographic TxCAD was 92% at one year, 64% at five years and 35% at eight years. The freedom from nuclear imaging TxCAD was 92% at one year, 69% at five years and 44% at eight years. However, a diagnosis of TxCAD by angiography only correlated with a diagnosis of TxCAD by nuclear imaging 52.8% of the time in the same patient, with a median time between studies of one month. The overall incidence of TxCAD diagnosed by angiography and nuclear imaging appears similar but correlates poorly in patients, casting doubt on the routine use of myocardial scintigraphy for screening TxCAD.
