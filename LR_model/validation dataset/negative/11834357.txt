Mycophenolate mofetil decreases antibody production after cardiac transplantation. New immunosuppressive drugs are extensively being investigated for their effect on T-cell immunity, with far less being known about their effect on the humoral immune response. In view of the experimental and clinical evidence that humoral immunity contributes to acute and chronic rejection, we investigated post-transplant production of anti-vimentin and anti-HLA antibodies in 86 patients who were part of a worldwide clinical trial for mycophenolate mofetil in cardiac transplantation. The results demonstrate that patients taking MMF instead of azathioprine generated significantly fewer de novo anti-vimentin antibodies.
