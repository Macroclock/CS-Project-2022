Suppression of murine cardiac allograft arteriopathy by long-term blockade of CD40-CD154 interactions. The interaction between CD40 on antigen-presenting cells and CD40L on T cells is critical in allograft rejection. CD154 blockade suppresses allograft rejection, but the role of this pathway in allograft vasculopathy remains obscure. A vascularized murine heterotopic cardiac transplant model was used to test whether perioperative CD154 blockade suppresses allograft vasculopathy or whether long-term CD154 blockade is required to suppress allograft vasculopathy. Perioperative CD154 blockade consisted of MR1 given on days -1, 1, and 3; long-term blockade consisted of MR1 given on days -1, 1, and 3 and continued twice weekly for 8 weeks. Allografts treated with perioperative or long-term CD154 blockade survived indefinitely. Perioperative and long-term treatment with control antibody (Ha4/8) resulted in uniform early rejection. Perioperative CD154 blockade transiently reduced early T-cell and macrophage infiltration in parallel with a transient reduction in endothelial adhesion receptor expression. Although perioperative CD154 blockade prevented allograft failure, it did not reduce allograft vasculopathy; mean neointimal cross-sectional area in perioperative MR1-treated and Ha4/8-treated recipients was 43+/-7% and 50+/-12%, respectively (P=NS). In contrast, mean neointimal cross-sectional area in long-term, MR1-treated recipients was 19+/-3% (P<0.001 versus perioperative MR1). Long-term CD154 blockade also suppressed endothelial E-selectin, P-selectin, and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 expression and improved graft function 3.5-fold versus control (P<0.05). These data show that perioperative CD154 blockade mitigates acute rejection but long-term CD154 blockade may result in decreased allograft endothelial activation and is required to suppress allograft arteriopathy.
