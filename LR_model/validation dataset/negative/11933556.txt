[Surgery in heart failure (without transplantation)]. Cardiac transplant remains the treatment of reference for end-stage cardiac insufficiency. The very great disparity between the number of grafts available and the number of patients eligible to be included on the transplant list drives some of them to contemplate a surgical alternative in order to improve their clinical condition and to delay as much as possible the date of transplant. The objective is to treat surgically one or several of the lesions causing the cardiac insufficiency. It could be valvular surgery, coronary surgery or a combination of both, ventricular remodelling or cardiomyoplasty. It is coronary revascularisation surgery which gives the most spectacular results on condition that it is aimed at the myocardial zones for which viability has been demonstrated by stress echocardiography or a PET scan.
