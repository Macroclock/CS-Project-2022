Psychosocial impact of heart transplantation on spouses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychosocial impact of heart transplantation on spouses and compare the adjustment of spouses and their partners. Data were collected from 51 couples prior to transplant and 12 months posttransplant. The Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS) was used to measure adjustment in seven domains. Prior to the transplant, spouses experienced profound psychosocial distress related to their partner's illness. From pretransplant to posttransplant, PAIS total score decreased (lower scores indicate better adjustment) for spouses (M = 42, SD = 16, vs. M = 26, SD = 13). Spouses showed improvement in all domains. Posttransplant, patients' and spouses' PAIS total scores (overall adjustment) were not significantly different. Spouses reported more psychological distress than patients; patients reported more problems than spouses in vocational and domestic function. Study findings highlight the importance of sensitivity in the clinical setting to the distinct psychosocial needs of spouses.
