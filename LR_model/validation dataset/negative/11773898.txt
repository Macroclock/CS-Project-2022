Donor-derived soluble MHC antigens plus low-dose cyclosporine induce transplantation unresponsiveness independent of the thymus by down-regulating T cell-mediated alloresponses in a rat transplantation model. In vitro, soluble MHC (sMHC) antigens modulate and induce apoptosis in alloreactive and antigen-specific T cells, demonstrating their potency to regulate T cell-mediated immune responses. However, their efficacy to regulate immunological responses in vivo remains unclear. Here, we report that repetitive intraperitoneal injection of recombinant Lewis rat-derived MHC class I antigens in Dark Agouti (DA) rats modulates alloreactivity. RT1.A1 (Lewis derived) genes were cloned into mammalian expression vectors, and RT1.Aa (DA derived) genes were used to transfect a rat myeloma cell line. RT1.A1 molecules were injected intraperitoneally in DA recipients that subsequently underwent transplantation with Lewis-derived cardiac allografts. Soluble class I antigens were secreted by the transfected cells and were shown to be heterodimeric, peptide-loaded, and conformationally folded. Injection of donor-derived soluble MHC significantly reduced the ability of recipient animals to mount a cytotoxic T-cell response to donor-derived tissue. More interestingly, this treatment significantly prolonged donor-graft survival and allowed 60% of treated animals to develop graft tolerance (>120 days), when donor sMHC were combined with a single subtherapeutic dosage of cyclosporine. Thymectomy of recipient animals before transplantation did not interfere with induction of peripheral tolerance. Donor-derived sMHC are potential tolerogens for down-regulating the cytotoxic T-cell response of animals that undergo transplantation. Thus, these data provide for the first time a rationale for the application of directly injected sMHC in vivo to down-regulate immunological responses and aid the induction of graft tolerance.
