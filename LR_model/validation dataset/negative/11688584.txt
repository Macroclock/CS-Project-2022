Chronic active myocarditis following acute Bartonella henselae infection (cat scratch disease). An association between Bartonella infection and myocardial inflammation has not been previously reported. We document a case of a healthy young man who developed chronic active myocarditis after infection with Bartonella henselae (cat scratch disease). He progressed to severe heart failure and underwent orthotopic heart transplantation. Bartonella henselae, therefore, should be included among the list of infectious agents associated with chronic active myocarditis.
