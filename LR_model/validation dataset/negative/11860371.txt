Circulatory responses to a meal in patients with a newly transplanted heart. It is well established that consumption of a meal releases a gradually developing and quite marked increase in blood flow to the gastrointestinal organs and a similar and simultaneous increase in cardiac output (CO). It is not known through which mechanism the pumping of the heart adjusts so accurately to the gastrointestinal flow increase. We have approached this problem by serving a standardized, mixed meal to five patients with recently transplanted and thus denervated hearts and to five sex- and age-matched controls. Pre- and postprandial levels of CO and blood flow in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) were recorded with Doppler ultrasound technique. The patients with transplanted hearts had significantly higher preprandial levels of heart rate (HR) and CO than the controls. With a timing similar to that seen in the controls did all five patients develop considerable and synchronous postprandial increases in superior mesenteric arterial flow and in CO. Increases in superior mesenteric arterial flow were significantly greater than the controls. Also, COs, high even before meals were given, increased further and to the same relative extent as in the control persons. The marked postprandial increase in CO, probably secondary to the increase in intestinal blood flow, could hardly come about through any sort of nervous reflex to the recently transplanted and denervated hearts. It appears more likely that a humoral connection of some sort exists between the two circulatory events.
