Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation before induction of anesthesia in critically ill thoracic transplant patients. Cardiorespiratory failure just before surgery in critically ill thoracic transplant patients can have catastrophic consequences. We judged the cardiorespiratory condition in three of 160 thoracic transplant procedures performed in our center too unstable for a safe induction of anesthesia. In these 3 patients, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was installed before induction of anesthesia to maintain an adequate cardiorespiratory state. This strategy was successful for all 3 patients, and long-term survival was achieved with a good quality of life. Guidelines for indications to follow this strategy are discussed.
