Inhaled nitric oxide for pulmonary hypertension after heart transplantation. Recipient pulmonary hypertension due to chronic congestive heart failure is a major cause of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction after heart transplantation. We hypothesized that inhaled nitric oxide (NO), in the postoperative period, would a) selectively reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and improve RV hemodynamics and b) reduce the incidence of RV dysfunction compared with a matched historical group. Sixteen consecutive adult heart transplant recipients with lowest mean pulmonary artery (PA) pressures >25 mmHg were prospectively enrolled. Inhaled NO at 20 parts per million (ppm) was initiated before termination of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). At 6 and 12 hours after CPB, NO was stopped for 15 minutes and systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics were measured. RV dysfunction was defined as central venous pressure >15 mmHg and consistent echocardiographic findings. The incidence of RV dysfunction and 30-day survival in this group was compared with a historical cohort of 16 patients matched for pulmonary hypertension. Discontinuation of NO for 15 minutes at 6 hours after transplantation resulted in a significant rise in mean PA pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and RV stroke work index. Systemic hemodynamics were not affected by NO therapy. One patient in the NO-treated group, compared with 6 patients in the historical cohort group, developed RV dysfunction (P< .05). The 30-day survival in the NO-treated group and the historical cohort group were 100% and 81%, respectively (P> .05). In heart transplant recipients with pulmonary hypertension, inhaled NO in the postoperative period selectively reduces PVR and enhances RV stroke work. Furthermore, NO reduces the incidence of RV dysfunction in this group of patients when compared with a historical cohort matched for pulmonary hypertension. Inhaled NO is a useful adjunct to the postoperative treatment protocol of heart transplant patients with pulmonary hypertension.
