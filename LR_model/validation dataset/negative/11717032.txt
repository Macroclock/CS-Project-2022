Myocardial fluid balance. Fluid accumulation in the cardiac interstitium or myocardial edema is a common manifestation of many clinical states. Specifically, cardiac surgery includes various interventions and pathophysiological conditions that cause or worsen myocardial edema including cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest. Myocardial edema should be a concern for clinicians as it has been demonstrated to produce cardiac dysfunction. This article will briefly discuss the factors governing myocardial fluid balance and review the evidence of myocardial edema in various pathological conditions. In particular, myocardial microvascular, interstitial, and lymphatic interactions relevant to the field of cardiac surgery will be emphasized.
