Heart allograft tolerance without development of posttransplant cardiac allograft vasculopathy in chimerism-based, drug-induced tolerance. Recently, we have described a drug (cyclophosphamide [CP] plus busulfan [BU])-induced skin allograft tolerance in mice that can regularly overcome fully H-2-mismatched barriers. Using this method, we have investigated whether or not this regimen can prolong the survival of heart allografts and inhibit the development of posttransplant cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). The components of the method are intravenous administration of 1 x 108 allogeneic spleen cells on day 0, intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg of CP and 30 mg/kg of BU on day 2, and intravenous injection of T cell-depleted 1 x 107 allogeneic bone marrow cells from the same strain of mice on day 3. Heart grafting was performed on day 28. Chimerism in peripheral blood was followed by flow cytometric analysis, and histological analysis was performed at various times after grafting. In a fully major histocompatability complex (MHC)-mismatched combination of B10.D2 (H-2d, IE+)-->B10 (H-2b, IE-), stable, multilineage-mixed chimerism was observed permanently. B10.D2 heart grafts were accepted permanently in a donor-specific manner, and posttransplant CAV did not develop. These results demonstrated that the drug-induced tolerance recently established by us can regularly induce a long-lasting heart allograft tolerance without development of CAV.
