Magnetic resonance spectroscopy in human cardiomyopathies. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can noninvasively provide a window into the metabolic status of the heart. This technique has shown abnormalities in the phosphocreatine-to-adenosine triphosphate ratio in patients with severe cardiomyopathies, either dilated or hypertrophic. Data indicate that abnormal metabolic parameters can risk stratify patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and provide independent prognostic information. Finally, the use of MRS in patients after cardiac transplantation is being explored. The information from cardiac MRS will likely provide the investigator and clinician with unique data and assist in the diagnosis and management of patients with various forms of heart disease.
