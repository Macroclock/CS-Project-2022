Urapidil reduces elevated pulmonary vascular resistance in patients before heart transplantation. Elevated pulmonary vascular resistance is a major limitation for heart transplantation. Urapidil is a centrally and peripherally acting anti-hypertensive drug, able to decrease elevated pulmonary vascular resistance in patients with either chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or heart failure. Urapidil is available as an oral or intravenous drug. In this study, we evaluated the possible beneficial effects of intravenous urapidil in patients with reversible, elevated pulmonary vascular resistance who were scheduled for heart transplantation. After approval by the Ethics Committee and written consent, 22 consecutive patients with end-stage heart failure and history of pulmonary vascular resistance >3 Wood units were enrolled into an open, prospective study. Using a (right ventricular ejection fraction) REF-Swan-Ganz catheter, hemodynamics were determined during administration of nitric oxide, and before and after 3 repeated intravenous applications of 10 mg urapidil. The treatment goal was reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance by at least 30%. Twenty-two patients were included to obtain complete data for 14 patients. Eight patients were not treated with urapidil: 7 patients had normal pulmonary vascular resistance at baseline, and 1 patient experienced moderate pulmonary edema before the study began. Two patients did not reach the treatment goal. In patients who responded to urapidil, the following hemodynamic changes were observed: decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (-48%), decreased transpulmonary gradient (20.0 to 13.7 mm Hg), decreased mean pulmonary arterial pressure (40 to 31 mm Hg), decreased systemic vascular resistance (-27%), mean arterial pressure (80 to 72 mm Hg), and increased right heart ejection fraction (21% to 27%). Heart rate remained unchanged. Intravenous urapidil lowered elevated pulmonary vascular resistance in patients before heart transplantation. In comparison with other vasodilative drugs, the major benefit of urapidil is its oral formulation.
