Analysis of the CD40 and CD28 pathways on alloimmune responses by CD4+ T cells in vivo. Blockade of the CD40 and CD28 pathways is a powerful strategy to inhibit CD4-mediated alloimmune responses. In this study, we examine the relative roles of the CD40 and CD28 pathways on CD4-mediated allograft rejection responses, and further characterize the role of these pathways on CD4+ T-cell activation, priming for cytokine production, and cell proliferation in response to alloantigen in vivo. BALB/c skin allografts were transplanted onto C57BL/6 Rag 1-/- recipients reconstituted with CD4 cells from CD28-/- or CD40L-/- donors. The popliteal lymph node assay was used to study the role of these pathways on CD4-cell activation and priming in vivo. To investigate the role of CD40 and CD28 blockade on CD4-cell proliferation, the fluorescein dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester was used. We performed heterotopic cardiac transplantation using CD40-/- mice to evaluate the role of CD40 on donor versus recipient cells in CD4-mediated rejection. B6 Rag 1-/- recipients reconstituted with CD28-/- CD4+ T cells acutely rejected allografts (median survival time 15 days), whereas recipients reconstituted with CD40L-/- CD4+ T cells had significantly prolonged survival of BALB/c skin grafts (MST 71 days). CD40L blockade was equivalent to or inferior to CD28 blockade in inhibition of in vivo CD4-cell activation, priming for cytokine production, and proliferation responses to alloantigen. BALB/c recipients depleted of CD8 cells promptly rejected donor B6 CD40-/- cardiac allografts, whereas B6 CD40-/- recipients depleted of CD8 cells had significantly prolonged survival of BALB/c wild-type cardiac allografts. The CD40/CD40L pathway, but not the CD28/B7 pathway, is critical for CD4-mediated rejection responses, however, the responsible mechanisms remain unclear.
