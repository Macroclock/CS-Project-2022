Ex-vivo mitral valve repair prior to orthotopic cardiac transplantation. Mitral valve annuloplasty was performed prior to orthotopic cardiac transplantation in two donor hearts which were diagnosed with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. The technical aspects are reviewed of ex-vivo mitral valve repair with concomitant heart transplantation. The recipients were classified as United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) I and both patients have had an excellent postoperative recovery. Over 2-year follow-up demonstrates normal mitral valve function without regurgitation.
