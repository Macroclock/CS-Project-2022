Inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibition of weibel-palade body release in cardiac transplant rejection. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS, or NOS2) reduces the severity of accelerated graft arteriosclerosis (AGA) in transplanted organs, although the precise mechanism is unclear. We transplanted wild-type murine hearts into either wild-type or NOS2-null recipient mice; we then measured cardiac allograft survival and analyzed tissue sections by immunohistochemistry. We have confirmed that NOS2 increases cardiac allograft survival. We now show that there is less inflammation of cardiac allografts in wild-type hosts than in NOS2-null hosts. Furthermore, staining for von Willebrand factor reveals that the presence of NOS2 is correlated with the presence of Weibel-Palade bodies inside endothelial cells, whereas the absence of NOS2 is correlated with the release of Weibel-Palade bodies. Weibel-Palade bodies contain mediators that promote thrombosis and inflammation. Therefore, nitric oxide (NO) may stabilize the vessel wall and prevent endothelial activation in part by inhibiting the release of the contents of Weibel-Palade bodies. Prevention of Weibel-Palade body release might be a mechanism by which NO protects the vessel wall from inflammatory disorders such as atherosclerosis or graft arteriosclerosis.
