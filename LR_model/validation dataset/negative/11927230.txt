Disseminated Cladophialophora bantiana infection in a heart transplant recipient. Cerebral phaeohyphomycosis caused by Cladophialophora bantiana, a dematiaceous fungus, is a rare disease. The majority of cases have been reported among immunocompetent patients; only 4 cases have been published that describe transplantation patients. The overall prognosis is poor. Surgical therapy in combination with chemotherapy with itraconazole is recommended. We report the case of a heart transplant recipient with cutaneous, cerebral, and lung manifestation of Cladophialophora bantiana who died despite surgical and systemic, high-dosage itraconazole treatment.
