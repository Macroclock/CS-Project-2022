Psychological distress across the course of care: a case study from implantable cardioverter defibrillator to cardiac transplantation evaluation. The psychological distress of cardiac patients can complicate treatment or the recovery process. This case study presents a 47-year-old male recipient of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator who experienced multiple, consecutive shocks and subsequently developed anxiety and depressive difficulties. Psychological treatment to diminish these symptoms was employed. Despite declining cardiac function, the patient made significant progress in managing this negative affect. Subsequently, he was evaluated for cardiac transplant, and this treatment progress became critical evidence of his psychosocial suitability for transplant.
