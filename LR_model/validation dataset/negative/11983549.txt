Celsior solution provides superior post-ischemic right ventricular function as compared with UW solution in a porcine heart transplantation model. Use of the new cardioprotective Celsior solution has been suggested for organ preservation in cardiac transplantation, but selective data for right ventricular function, of special interest in the clinical setting, have not been evaluated. Celsior solution was compared with the clinical standard University of Wisconsin solution (UW) in a porcine allogenic heart transplantation model with accurate isovolumic measurement of right ventricular (RV) function. Maximum RV developed pressures were significantly different between Celsior and UW groups (51.1 +/- 9.6 mm Hg vs 42.2 +/- 15.4 mm Hg after 1 hour, respectively, and 55.6 +/- 7.8 mm Hg vs 45.1 +/- 16.2 mm Hg after 2 hours, respectively; p = 0.02, 2-way analysis of variance). Celsior significantly improves post-ischemic right ventricular function when compared with UW solution in an experimental heart transplantation model.
