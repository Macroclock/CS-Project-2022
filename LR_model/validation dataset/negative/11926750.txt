Role of cytomegalovirus in cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is the most common cause of death and retransplantation following heart transplantation, and about 10% of patients per year have evidence of accelerated vascular disease; 50% at 5 years. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection has been associated with accelerated cardiac vasculopathy and decreased 5-year survival. Prophylactic therapy using ganciclovir has reduced the incidence of CMV disease, but not in the group at highest risk, namely the seronegative recipient of an allograft from a seropositive donor (D+/R-). Combination prophylaxis consisting of CMV hyperimmune globulin (CMV-IGIV) plus ganciclovir is associated with decreased intimal thickening, reduced coronary artery disease and obliterative bronchiolitis, and improved survival.
