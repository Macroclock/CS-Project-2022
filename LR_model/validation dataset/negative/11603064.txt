[Cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction: surgical revascularization with centrifugal left ventricular assistance. Report of 2 cases treated successfully]. Cardiogenic shock in the acute phase of myocardial infarction still carries a high mortality. In young patients who cannot be revascularised by angioplasty, when medical therapy is failing, some workers recommend an energetic approach, even cardiac transplantation, often with the bridge of mechanical cardiac assistance. This is not possible everywhere, thus preventing possible myocardial salvage and resulting in fairly high mortality. The authors report two cases in which endoluminal revascularisation was not possible and so complete surgical revascularisation with left ventricular assistance was chosen. The two patients survived and one was successfully transplanted electively. This management may be proposed in young patients with multiple occlusions of large coronary arteries in post-infarction cardiogenic shock when medical management is failing despite intra-aortic balloon pumping.
