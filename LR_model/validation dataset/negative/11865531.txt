Heart rate stationarity in heart transplanted patients. The heart rate stationary was studied by tachographic of 24 Holter analysis in 15 normal subjects and in 13 recipient subjects that were heart transplanted at least 5 years and that, at the time of our research, presented a very good post-operative course. To test the stationary heart rate we performed a scanning of Holter in qualified strips of four beats in which the three consecutive intervals demonstrate a constant acceleration or deceleration sequential variations of tachographic values. The results obtained demonstrated that in normal and transplanted subjects stationary and non stationary strips are evident. Both in normal and in transplanted subjects non-stationary strips are prevalent, although in different ways: in normal subjects the stationary and non-stationary ratio is 1:1.40; in transplanted subjects the ratio is 1:1.68. Non-stationary strips, that in the cartesian plane do not demonstrate any directional variation, in normal subjects are, on average, higher than in transplanted subjects. The same phenomenon is available for the strips with only one variation. The strips with three consecutive variations are much more evident (more 50%) in transplanted subjects. These strips are also more numerous compared to the sum of all the other strips with a single variation. The statistical analysis demonstrates that the difference between the normal and the transplanted subjects is significative. Our data can suggest an absent autonomic nervous system regulation and can confirm the results we obtained in these patients using a phase space analysis of the same Holter recording.
