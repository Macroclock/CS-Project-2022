LFA-1 and ICAM-1 antibody-idarubicin conjugates separately prolong murine cardiac allograft survival. Drug antibody conjugates can enhance the activity of monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) and idarubicin-MoAb conjugates have led to tolerance induction with antibodies which are inactive when used alone. It has been reported that, in mice, antibodies to ICAM-1 and LFA-1 have to be used together to induce tolerance to cardiac allografts; here we show that these monoclonal antibodies, conjugated to idarubicin, can lead to tolerance induction to cardiac allografts when used alone.
