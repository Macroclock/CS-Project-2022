Psychological impact of the physician-patient relationship on compliance: a case study and clinical strategies. This article presents a case of a heart transplant recipient's noncompliance. A patient's probable medical compliance is among the primary psychosocial criteria in determining his or her eligibility for a heart transplant. The ability to predict and facilitate patient compliance remains a challenge to physicians in all areas of medicine and surgery. The accuracy of the compliance prediction is often contingent upon information generated by patient interviews, other medical personnel, and the patient's family members. All too often, this vital information is based on subjective data, creating difficulty for physicians in appraising patient compliance behavior. Such an amorphous data gathering process may leave physicians at a loss to explain the nature and extent of their patients' behaviors. Research has yet to provide consistent objective measures for compliance prediction. Patient compliance affects all corridors of medical practice and is responsible for an innumerable loss of human life, and financial resources each year.
