Mechanisms of targeting CD28 by a signaling monoclonal antibody in acute and chronic allograft rejection. There is increasing evidence that ongoing T-cell recognition of alloantigen and activation are key mediators of chronic allograft rejection. The CD28-B7 pathway is unique among costimulatory pathways in that two alternate ligands for B7 exist: CD28 and CTLA4. Recently, it has been suggested that CTLA4 negative signaling may be required for induction of acquired tolerance in vivo. A strategy by which the T cell is targeted at the CD28 receptor rather than its ligands would theoretically allow the inhibitory functions of the CTLA4-B7-1/2 axis to remain intact. Using a rat-specific monoclonal antibody, we investigated the effect of targeting CD28 in a model of chronic rejection without the confounding variable of immunosuppression. We also used an acute cardiac allograft rejection model to investigate CD28 stimulation-based strategies to induce donor-specific tolerance. We demonstrated that anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody was as effective as CTLA4 immunoglobulin in protecting against chronic allograft vasculopathy. In addition, a short course of cyclosporine therapy synergized with either anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody or CTLA4 immunoglobulin, suggesting that it may be clinically relevant to combine low-dose calcineurin inhibitors with CTLA4 immunoglobulin or anti-B7 antibodies. Finally, we report on the potential mechanisms of action of targeting CD28 in vivo.
