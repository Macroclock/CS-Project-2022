Maturation of xenoantibody gene expression during the humoral immune response of rats to hamster xenografts. Immunoglobulin isotype switching represents an important component of antibody maturation in the development of humoral immune responses. We have recently conducted a series of studies in a nonimmunosuppressed rodent model to define the kinetics of xenoantibody production and seek evidence for the maturation of xenoantibody Ig gene expression by xenograft recipients. LEW rats were transplanted with hamster cardiac xenografts and the grafts were allowed to remain in situ for prolonged immune stimulation of the host. Anti-hamster antibodies were examined at days 4, 8, 21, 28 and 40 post-transplantation. cDNA libraries specific for rat mu or gamma heavy chains were constructed from B lymphocytes of the xenograft recipients at day 4 and day 21 post-transplantation. Selected cDNA clones encoding the Ig V(H)HAR family of genes from each group were sequenced and analyzed for the presence of somatic mutations. We found that the reactivity of xenoantibodies examined with flow cytometry underwent sequential changes in which IgM titers peaked at day 8 post-transplantation (PTx) and returned to low levels after 21 days. IgG titers started to increase at about one week PTx and peaked at 21-28 days. All the IgG isotypes (IgG1, 2a, 2b and 2c) were differentially involved in the IgG responses. Serum passive transfer experiments demonstrated that IgM antibody fractions separated from sera at day 4 post-transplantation were capable of causing hyperacute rejection (HAR) of hamster xenografts, whereas IgM fractions from days 21-40 failed to cause HAR (N = 7, MST = 4 days), a pattern that was consistent with a rise in total xenoreactive IgM levels at days 4-8 and a fall to low levels at 21 days post-transplantation. IgG-containing fractions separated from day 21-40 antisera caused HAR (N = 7, MST = 36 min) whereas IgG fractions from day 8 sera failed to induce graft rejection. Genetic analysis of the rearranged VH genes from 10 cDNA clones demonstrated that the Ig mu (n = 5) and gamma (n = 5) chain clones used the same family of VH genes (V(H)HAR family) to encode their antibody binding activity. The majority (80%) of the IgM clones were present in their original germline configuration. In contrast, the nucleotide sequences from IgG clones manifested an increase in the numbers of replacement mutations in the CDR region of the Ig heavy chain genes, providing evidence for a potential role for somatic mutation in the maturation of IgG xenoantibody responses as the humoral response matures with time post-transplantation.
