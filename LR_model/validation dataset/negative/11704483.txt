Atrial transplantation for recurrent cardiac sarcoma. Cardiac transplantation for sarcomas has met with little success and the surgical treatment remains controversial. We describe the case of a 56-year-old woman who was referred for transplantation after two procedures in which undifferentiated atrial sarcoma was locally excised successfully. The patient underwent atrial homograft transplantation, the first reported to date. Advantages of the procedure include wide atrial resection and no need for immune suppression.
