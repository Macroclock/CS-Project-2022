Should we still perform angioplasty and stenting of an unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis in heart transplant patients? Two new cases and a review of the literature. Coronary balloon angioplasty with stent implantation has emerged as a possible alternative to bypass grafting or repeat transplantation in left main coronary stenosis in heart transplant patients. We report 2 new cases of stent implantation for unprotected and isolated left main stenosis in heart transplant patients. Despite an initially successful procedure, restenosis prompted the performance of bypass surgery in both patients. The relative advantages and disadvantages of available techniques of revascularization are discussed in the context of the literature.
