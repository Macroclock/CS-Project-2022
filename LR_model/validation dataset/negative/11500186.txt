Impact of vascular branching sites on focal progression of allograft vasculopathy in transplanted hearts. Cardiac allograft vascular disease (CAVD) represents one of the most accelerated progressing coronary syndromes in the human heart. A variety of risk factors have been identified over recent years; however, little is known about the influence of physical forces. As a model for differences in focal blood flow dynamics, we analyzed progression of intimal hyperplasia at vascular bifurcational sites using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). The most diseased vascular sites ("worst sites") in 59 coronary arteries were assessed (30 MHz, motorized pull back) in 25 consecutive heart transplant recipients at baseline (52.8+/-15.3 days postoperatively) and after 1 year of follow up (360.5+/-24.9 days). Progression of intimal hyperplasia was compared between branching and non-branching lesions as well as in focal relation to the position of the flow divider. A total of 41 (69.5%) worst sites were identified at branching locations. Progression of intimal hyperplasia was found to be significantly more severe at bifurcational sites with an increase in plaque area by 1.5+/-1.8 mm(2) in branching versus 0.4+/-0.6 mm(2) in non-branching lesions (P=0.015). The highest rate in focal progression was found at the opposite site of the flow divider with an increase in maximal intimal thickness by 0.3+/-0.23 mm (180 degrees ) as compared to 0.11+/-0.15 mm (90 degrees, P<0.001) and 0.15+/-0.15 mm (P=0.014) at 270 degrees. Using serial intravascular ultrasound examinations, vascular branching sites could be identified to be predisposing locations not only for a donor related arteriosclerosis, but also for progression of intimal hyperplasia within transplanted hearts. The highest regional increase in intimal thickness was found at the outer wall of the flow divider, suggesting focal shear or wall stress to be involved in pathogenesis.
