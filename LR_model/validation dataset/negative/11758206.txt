[Expression of cytokines in acute heart transplantation rejection]. To observe the expression and changes of local cytokines network in rat heart transplantation so as to determine the role of cytokines in acute rejection of rat heart transplantation. The Wistar rats (receptor) were divided into four groups: group A(control, n = 12), group B(IL-2 Mab treated, n = 12), group C [Cyclosporine A (CsA) treated, n = 12] and group D(IL-2Mab + CsA treated, n = 12). Hearts from SD rats were transplanted into a cervical location in Wistar. The local expression of IL-1 beta, IL-2, CD25, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, TNF alpha, IFN gamma was examined at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14 days after operation by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Allografts survival time was (8.3 +/- 1.7) days in group A, (29.2 +/- 7.1) days in group B, (26.4 +/- 5.7) days in group C, (55.0 +/- 10.6) days in group D. The expression of IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-10, IFN gamma was up-regulated, and the expression of IL-2, CD25, IL-5, IL-6, TNF alpha was significantly inhibited in group A. The expression of IL-1 beta, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IFN gamma was up-regulated, and the expression of IL-2, IL-4, TNF alpha was significantly down-regulated in group B. The expression of IL-1 beta, IL-2, CD25, IL-5, TNF alpha, IFN gamma was up-regulated, and the expression of IL-4, IL-6, Il-10 was significantly down-regulated in group C. The expression of IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10 was up-regulated, and the expression of IL-1 beta, IL-2, CD25, IFN gamma, TNF alpha was significantly down-regulated in group D. Cytokines play an important role in the development of acute transplantational rejection. Different cytokines play different roles in different local environments; the main principle possibly is immune deviation.
