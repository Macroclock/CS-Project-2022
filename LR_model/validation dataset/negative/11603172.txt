[Risk of hypertension after heart transplantation in the follow-up period]. From October 1988 to March 2000, 58 patients underwent orthotopic heart transplantation (HTX). Data of 220 heart recipients with the follow up > or = 3 months after HTX were analyzed using the average values of blood pressure measured with the sphigmo-manometer. 65% of patients were diagnosed with the hypertension (HA). 39.9% of those patients (NTA group) had the systolic blood pressure < or = 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mmHg during pharmacotherapy. 60.1% of hypertensive patients (NTB group) had the systolic pressure > 140 mmHg and/or diastolic pressure > 90 mmHg despite pharmacotherapy. 35% of all patients had normal blood pressure after HTX (HNA group). Patients with hypertension were older and the end stage ischemic cardiomyopathy was more frequently indication for HTX. Significantly more females were in NTA group. We observed no influence of the daily dose of cyclosporine or other immunosuppressive drugs on HA. The average blood concentration of cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil was similar in all groups. The calcium channel blockers and inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme were main tool of pharmacotherapy used. In NTA group calcium channels blockers were used more frequently. In NTB group there was a statistically significant higher blood level of creatinine. After HTX there is a high risk of HA, which: increases with age, with the ischemic cardiomyopathy as indication to HTX, is significantly higher in males, there is no correlation between HA and the dosage and blood level of cyclosporine, increases with kidney insufficiency. In monotherapy calcium channel blockers seem to be especially effective.
