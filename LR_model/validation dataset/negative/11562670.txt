Renal transplantation following previous heart, liver, and lung transplantation: an 8-year single-center experience. Long-term follow-up of heart, liver, and lung transplantation has led to an increased recognition of secondary end-stage renal failure (ESRF) in transplant recipients. This study examines our center's experience with renal transplantation following previous solid organ transplantation. From January 1, 1992, to September 30, 1999, our center performed 18 renal transplants in previous solid organ recipients. During the same period, 815 total renal transplants were performed. One- and 3-year graft and patient survival, recipient demographics, donor type, and reason for transplantation were compared between these groups. Of the 18 recipients, 7 had prior heart transplants, 4 had prior liver transplants, and 7 had prior lung transplants. Cyclosporine toxicity contributed to renal failure in 17 (94.4%) of the patients-either as a sole factor (11 patients) or in combination with hypertension, renal artery stenosis, or tacrolimus toxicity (6 patients). Kaplan-Meier 1- and 3-year patient survival was 82.9% and 73.7%, compared with 95.5% and 90.7% in all renal transplant recipients. No surviving patient has suffered renal allograft loss. Mean current creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL. Renal transplantation is an excellent therapy for ESRF following prior solid organ transplantation. One and 3-year patient and graft survival demonstrate the utility of renal transplantation in this patient population.
