Outcomes in adult congenital heart disease patients undergoing heart transplantation: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Studies assessing mortality and morbidity in adult transplant recipients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are limited. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing post-transplant outcomes in these 2 populations. After conducting an electronic database search, we selected studies evaluating mortality, cause-specific mortality, and risk of reoperation and dialysis in adult CHD vs non-CHD patients. We used random-effects models for the meta-analysis. Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in CHD vs non-CHD patients (risk ratio [RR], 2.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62-2.93; I Although adult CHD patients have higher early mortality, post-transplantation long-term survival is superior to non-CHD recipients. The challenge is to identify the CHD patients who will benefit from transplantation vs those who are higher risk.
