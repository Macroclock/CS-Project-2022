Long-Term Outcomes of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Diagnosed During Childhood: Results From a National Population-Based Study. Late survival and symptomatic status of children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have not been well defined. We examined long-term outcomes for pediatric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The National Australian Childhood Cardiomyopathy Study is a longitudinal population-based cohort study of children (0-10 years of age) diagnosed with cardiomyopathy between 1987 and 1996. The primary study end point was time to death or cardiac transplantation. There were 80 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with a median age at diagnosis of 0.48 (interquartile range, 0.1, 2.5) years. Freedom from death/transplantation was 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.0-92.0) 1 year after presentation, 80% (95% CI, 69.0-87.0) at 10 years, and 78% (95% CI, 67.0-86.0) at 20 years. From multivariable analyses, risk factors for death/transplantation included symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of diagnosis (hazard ratio, 4.20; 95% CI, 1.60-11.05;  The highest risk of death or transplantation for children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is within 1 year after diagnosis, with low attrition rates thereafter. Many subjects receive medical, surgical, or device therapy. 'cardiovascular surgery', 'myocardial cardiomyopathy disease', 'pediatric and congenital heart disease'
