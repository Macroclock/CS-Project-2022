Percutaneous coronary artery revascularization procedures in pediatric heart transplant recipients: A large single center experience. To describe our experience, at a large pediatric heart transplant center, with percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) for cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). CAV is a leading cause of late graft failure, mortality, and re-transplantation in pediatric heart transplant (HTx) recipients. Studies of PCI in adult patients have shown some short-term improvements, but no significant change in long-term outcomes. There are limited data on PCI for CAV in pediatric patients. We describe the largest single-center experience to date. We performed a retrospective chart review of all pediatric HTx recipients who underwent PCI for a diagnosis of CAV from 2005 to 2014. Twenty-three procedures were performed in 13 patients, at a median age of 16.4 years (range 5.6-21.2) and median time from HTx to first PCI of 8.3 years (range 2.9-20.3). Three cases consisted of angioplasty alone, two cases had bare metal stents implanted, and the remaining 18 had drug-eluting stents implanted. There was acute procedural success in all but one case, and there was only one procedure-related complication (rebleeding from access site). During the follow-up interval (median 10.4 months, range 0.2-111.8), 7/13 patients had repeat PCI performed, two patients died (at 1.8 and 5.8 months post-PCI), and five were re-transplanted (range 0.2-18 months post-PCI). Freedom from death or retransplant by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 54% at 1 year. PCI can be performed safely and effectively in pediatric HTx recipients with CAV. Similar to the adult experience, there remains a high rate of disease progression and graft failure. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
