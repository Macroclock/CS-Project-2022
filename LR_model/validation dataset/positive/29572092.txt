Model for End-Stage Liver Disease Excluding INR (MELD-XI) score is associated with hemodynamic impairment and predicts mortality in critically ill patients. We aimed (i) to evaluate Model for End-stage Liver Disease excluding INR (MELD-XI) score for prediction of mortality in a cohort of critically ill patients and (ii) to investigate associations of MELD-XI with microcirculation and (iii) to evaluate microcirculation for prediction of mortality in high-risk patients, e.g., with high MELD-XI scores. 308 patients were included in our retrospective analysis, a subgroup of the multicenter micro-SOAP-study. Microcirculation was evaluated by Sidestream Dark Field (SDF) imaging. Evaluation of associations with mortality was done by logistic regression analysis, an optimal cut-off was calculated by means of the Youden Index. We divided the cohort in two sub-groups based on their MELD-XI score at the optimal cut-off (12 score points). Patients with a MELD-XI > 12 points were of similar age (60 ± 1 years vs 62 ± 2 years; p = 0.32), but clinically sicker as mirrored by higher APACHE II scores (20 ± 1 vs 16 ± 1; p < 0.001). In the MELD-XI > 12 cohort in-hospital mortality was significantly higher compared to the MELD ≤ 12 group (48% vs 24%%; HR 2.98 95%CI 1.76-5.04; p = 0.003) and MELD-XI score was associated with mortality even after correction for relevant clinical confounders (HR 1.04 95%CI 1.01-1.07; p = 0.004) There were no associations between MELD-XI and parameters of microvascular perfusion. MELD-XI is associated with in-hospital mortality and constitutes a useful tool for risk stratification in intensive care medicine. Interestingly, there were no associations between MELD-XI and microcirculation. Possibly parameters of the microcirculation present an online tool of hemodynamic assessment while MELD-XI presents an assessment of already established organ failure.
