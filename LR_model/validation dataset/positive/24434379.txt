CD20 antigen expression by lymphoma cells in lung allograft recipients is associated with higher remission rate and superior survival: a study on heart and lung transplant recipients. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) are one of the fatal complications of transplantation, and there is scarcity of data on the relevance of antigen expression by tumor cells in PTLD. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the potential effects of CD20 antigen expression by PTLD lesions developing in heart/lung transplant recipients. A comprehensive search was performed for reports indicating CD20 antigen tests in PTLD lesions developing in heart and/or lung transplant recipients. For data accumulation, we developed a standard questionnaire and data of patients presented in different published reports were entered into it. Finally, data from 26 previously published reports from different centers around the world were included in the analysis. CD20-positive PTLD lesions are significantly more likely to be of the B cell type (P = 0.006). PTLD in patients with a CD20-positive test represented relevantly shorter time from transplantation to PTLD, although it did not reach a significance level (P = 0.08). At the last follow-up, 53% patients were dead. Survival analysis showed no prognosis difference regarding CD20 test. When data were reanalyzed separately for heart and lung transplant recipients, lung recipients developing PTLD with a CD20-positive test were significantly more likely to represent remission episodes (P = 0.03), and also represented a significantly better outcome than CD20-negative PTLD patients (P = 0.04). CD20-positive PTLD lesions in heart/lung recipients are more likely of the B cell type and develop PTLD lesions earlier than their CD20-negative counterparts. Lung recipients developing CD20-positive PTLD lesions represented higher remission rates and better outcome. Further studies with prospective follow-up of patients are needed for confirming our findings.
