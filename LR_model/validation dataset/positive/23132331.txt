How small is too small? A systematic review of center volume and outcome after cardiac transplantation. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the volume of cardiac transplantation procedures performed in a center and the outcome after cardiac transplantation. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched for articles on the volume-outcome relationship in cardiac transplantation. Ten studies were identified, and all adopted a different approach to data analysis and varied in adjustment for baseline characteristics. The number of patients in each study ranged from 798 to 14401, and observed 1-year mortality ranged from 12.6% to 34%. There was no association between the continuous variables of center volume and observed mortality. There was a weak association between the continuous variables of center volume and adjusted mortality up to 1 year and a stronger association at 5 years. When centers were grouped in volume categories, low-volume centers had the highest adjusted mortality, intermediate-volume centers had lower adjusted mortality, and high-volume centers had the lowest adjusted mortality but were not significantly better than intermediate-volume centers. Category limits were arbitrary and varied between studies. There is a relationship between center volume and mortality in heart transplantation. The existence of a minimum acceptable center volume or threshold is unproven. However, a level of 10 to 12 heart transplants per year corresponds to the upper limit of low-volume categories that may have relatively higher mortality. It is not known whether outcomes for patients treated in low-volume transplant centers would be improved by reorganizing centers to ensure volumes in excess of 10 to 12 heart transplants per year.
