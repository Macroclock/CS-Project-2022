Combined Heart and Kidney Transplantation: A 23-Year Experience. We report clinical experience with combined heart and kidney transplantation (HKTx) over a 23-year time period. From June 1992 to August 2015, we performed 83 combined HKTx procedures at our institution. We compared the more recent cohort of 53 HKTx recipients (group 2, March 2009 to August 2015) with the initial 30 previously reported HKTx recipients (group 1, June 1992 to February 2009). Pre-operative patient characteristics, peri-operative factors, and post-operative outcomes including survival were examined. The baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar, except for a lower incidence of ethanol use and higher pre-operative left-ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac output, and cardiac index in group 2 when compared with group 1 (P = .007, .046, .037, respectively). The pump time was longer in group 2 compared with group 1 (153.30 ± 38.68 vs 129.60 ± 37.60 minutes; P = .007), whereas the graft ischemic time was not significantly different between the groups, with a trend to a longer graft ischemic time in group 2 versus group 1 (195.17 ± 45.06 vs 178.07 ± 52.77 minutes; P = .056, respectively). The lengths of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay were similar between the groups (P = .083 and .39, respectively). In addition, pre-operative and post-operative creatinine levels at peak, discharge, 1 year, and 5 years and the number of people on post-operative dialysis were similar between the groups (P = .37, .75, .54, .87, .56, and P = .139, respectively). Overall survival was not significantly different between groups 2 and 1 for the first 5 years after transplant, with a trend toward higher survival in group 2 (P = .054). The most recent cohort of combined heart and kidney transplant recipients had similar ICU and hospital lengths of stay and post-operative creatinine levels at peak, discharge, and 1 and 5 years and a similar number of patients on post-operative dialysis when compared with the initial cohort. Overall survival was not significantly different between the later and earlier groups, with a trend toward higher overall survival at 5 years in the more recent cohort of patients. In selected patients with co-existing heart and kidney failure, combined heart and kidney transplantation is safe to perform and has excellent outcomes.
