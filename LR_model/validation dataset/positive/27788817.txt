History of Lung and Heart-Lung Transplantation, With Special Emphasis on German-Speaking Countries. The first experimental lung transplants were performed in 1947 by the Russian surgeon V.P. Demikhov. Thereafter, various aspects associated with lung transplantation were studied by groups from Italy, France, and mainly the United States. The first clinical lung transplant took place in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1963 and was performed by D. Hardy. Until 1983, a total of 45 lung transplants were carried out at various centers, but only one patient transplanted in Ghent by F. Derom in 1968 survived for 10 months, whereas all other patients survived only hours to a few days. In 1983 at Toronto General Hospital, a single-lung transplant was performed that survived almost 7 years. From the same institution, the first long-term survivor after double-lung transplantation was reported in 1986. The first lobar transplant from a live donor was performed by V.A. Starnes at Stanford in 1990. The first heart-lung transplantation was performed in Houston by D.A. Cooley in 1968. Even though the girl who received this transplant survived only for 14 hours, this case showed that this kind of procedure can work. The first long-term survival was achieved by B. Reitz in 1981 in Stanford. In the German-speaking countries, successful lung and lung-heart transplants were reported between 1984 and 1993 and are described in detail.
