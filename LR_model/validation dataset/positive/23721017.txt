University of Pennsylvania Lung Transplantation: update 2012. The University of Pennsylvania is committed to providing the highest level of longitudinal care to patients with end stage lung disease who pursue and undergo lung transplantation. Since 1991, the Penn Lung Transplant Program has performed over 800 lung, heart/lung, lung/liver, and redo lung transplants. As a result of this experience, we believe in a careful, deliberate approach to patients throughout all phases of care and encourage active participation of patients and their support systems throughout this process. We aim to continue to be leaders in the field of transplant related research, with goals of improving short- and long-term outcomes and safely allowing this procedure to be made available to more patients who need it. This chapter provides an overview of our program structure and philosophy towards patient evaluation, as well as highlights the unique aspects of our program.
