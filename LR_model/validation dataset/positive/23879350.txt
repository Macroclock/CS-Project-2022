Metabolic syndrome in heart transplantation: impact on survival and renal function. The aim of our study was to analyze the early presence of metabolic syndrome (MS) in heart transplant (HTx) patients, and to assess its long-term impact on survival and renal function. From January 2000 to October 2011, 253 consecutive HTx patients who survived more than 90 days were included. MS was diagnosed if patients met revised NCEP-ATP III criteria at HTx or within 3 months post-HTx. The prevalence of MS was 41.9%. Patients with MS had greater overall mortality after a mean follow-up of 1700 ± 979 days (log-rank test, P = 0.020). In the multivariate analysis, and subject to a minimum survival of 90 days, the only independent predictor variables of long-term mortality were the presence of MS (OR, odds ratio 2.087, P = 0.032), and rejection episodes (OR 1.833, P = 0.001). Patients with MS had worse renal function at baseline both in plasma creatinine (1.19 ± 0.44 vs. 1.03 ± 0.29 mg/dl, P = 0.002) and glomerular filtration rate estimated by modified diet in renal disease (73.60 ± 26.76 vs. 87.30 ± 43.55 ml/min/1.73 m(2) , P = 0.005), whereas progressive impairment of renal function was of equal magnitude in both groups. The presence of MS prior to transplant or its development within the first 3 months identified a subgroup at greater risk of mortality and long-term renal dysfunction.
