[Results of a national program of pediatric heart transplantation: strengths and weakness]. Pediatric heart transplantation is an effective therapy to treat advanced heart failure in children. To analyze the immediate and mid-term results of pediatric patients listed for heart transplantation. Registration of patients admitted to our transplant protocol between October 2001 and July 2016 were reviewed, analyzing demographic data, diagnosis, status at the time of listing, waiting time until transplantation, donor data, use of ventricular assist device, hemodynamic data, complications and global mortality. Thirthy patients where included with a mean age of 9.4 years (1 month to 15 years). The most frequent diagnosis was dilated cardiomyopathy in 24 patients (80%). The status was I (urgency) in 19 cases and II in 11 cases. Ten patients died on the waiting list (33.3%) at an average of 52 days (13-139 days). Fourteen were transplanted (46.7%), with a waiting time of 199.6 days (4-586 days). Nine patients required mechanical support (30%). All patients received triple association of immunosuppression. One patient died 16 days post transplant due to primary graft failure (7.1%). The average follow-up was 43 months (0.5-159 months). Two patients died later on (82 and 55 months), both due to secondary rejection because of voluntary cessation of immunosuppressive therapy. Survival at 1 and 5 years was 93% and 74%, respectively. Our program has successfully transplanted 50% of patients enrolled, with good medium-term survival. A significant proportion of patients were listed as a medical emergency and 34.5% died on the waiting list.
