Outcome of cardiac transplantation in patients requiring prolonged continuous-flow left ventricular assist device support. This study assessed the early and late outcomes after cardiac transplantation in patients receiving long-term continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) support. Between April 2004 and September 2013, 192 patients underwent HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) CF-LVAD placement as a bridge to transplant at our center. Of these, 122 (63%) successfully bridged patients were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified into 2 groups according to their waiting time with CF-LVAD support of <1 year or ≥1 year. The study cohort was a mean age of 54 ± 13 years, 79% were male, and 35% had an ischemic etiology. The mean duration of CF-LVAD support before transplantation was 296 days (range, 27-1,413 days). The overall 30-day mortality was 4.1%. Overall post-transplant survival was 88%, 84%, 78% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The 32 patients (26%) with ≥1 year of CF-LVAD support (mean, 635 days) were more likely to have blood type O, a larger body size, and to have been readmitted due to recurrent heart failure and device failure requiring exchange than those with <1 year of CF-LVAD support. Patients who required prolonged support time also had worse in-hospital mortality (16% vs 6.7%, p = 0.12) and significantly lower survival at 3 years after transplantation (68% vs 88%, p = 0.049). The overall short-term and long-term cardiac transplant outcomes of patients supported with CF-LVAD are satisfactory. However, patients who require prolonged CF-LVAD support may have diminished post-transplant survival due to adverse events occurring during device support.
