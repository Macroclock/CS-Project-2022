Elevated pretransplant pulmonary vascular resistance index does not predict mortality after isolated orthotopic heart transplantation in children: A retrospective analysis of the UNOS database. OHT is the definitive therapy in end-stage heart failure. Elevated PVRI is considered a relative contraindication to isolated OHT; this assumption is re-evaluated using data from the UNOS database. A retrospective review of de-identified data from the UNOS dataset was performed. There were 1943 pediatric OHT recipients between 10/87 and 12/11 with sufficient data for analysis. Cox regression was performed to examine the effect of baseline characteristics on post-transplant survival. Patients were propensity matched, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed comparing cohorts of patients using thresholds of 6 and 9 WU × m(2) . PVRI was not a significant predictor of post-transplant outcomes in either univariate or multivariate Cox regression. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no difference in survival between both unmatched and propensity-matched OHT recipients. In conclusion, elevated PVRI was not associated with post-transplant mortality in pediatric OHT recipients. A prospective study assessing the current use of PVRI ≥6 as a threshold to contraindicate isolated OHT should be undertaken. Removing this potentially unnecessary restriction on transplant candidacy may make this life-saving therapy available to a greater number of patients.
