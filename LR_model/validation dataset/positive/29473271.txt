Neutropenia in pediatric heart transplant recipients. Neutropenia has been reported in pediatric heart transplant recipients, but its association with infectious morbidity and mortality is unknown. We sought to determine neutropenia's prevalence and impact on infection, rejection, and survival. A retrospective analysis of pediatric heart transplant recipients from March 2005 to August 2015 was performed. Demographics, medications, infection, and rejection data were collected. Of 142 pediatric heart transplant recipients, 77 (54.2%) developed neutropenia within 4.7 months [3.3-12.1 months] of transplant. In all patients, the adjusted 5-year cumulative incidence of neutropenia was 30.2%. Fifty-one patients (66.2%) had recurrent neutropenia. Six of 14 tested had positive antineutrophil antibodies. Medications associated with neutropenia were decreased in 15 (19.5%) and discontinued in 42 (54.4%) patients with no change in 1-year rejection rates compared to published data. Fifteen patients developed infection within 30 days of neutropenia and two from 30 days to 1 year, with an infection rate similar to the non-neutropenic group. There was no significant difference in survival, ANC, rate of rejection or PTLD in neutropenic patients with and without infection at median follow-up (5.5 years). Neutropenia is common in pediatric heart transplant recipients. Neutropenia had <20% risk of associated infection, similar to non-neutropenic patients. Infection in neutropenic patients did not increase mortality. 'children', 'heart transplantation', 'infectious risk', 'neutropenia'
