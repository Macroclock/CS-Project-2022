Impact of pulmonary hypertension on early hemodynamics, morbidity and mortality after orthotopic heart transplantation. A single center study. To determine the effect of pre-existing pulmonary hypertension (PHT) on early hemodynamics, morbidity and mortality after heart transplantation (HTx). Data were prospectively collected from 149 patients, who underwent HTx between January 2000 and December 2007. The subjects were divided into 3 groups: Group A (n=84) without PTH, group B (n=50) with mild to moderate PTH and group C (n=15) with severe PTH. We studied hemodynamic profile, tricuspid valve regurgitation (TR), incidence of acute cellular rejections (AR), infections, duration of hospitalization, 30-day mortality and a long-term survival. Baseline characteristics were similar in all groups. Using vasodilator treatment PVR was successfully brought down to normal range 2.5 ± 0.6 Wood' units (WU) on the day 1 following the surgery in all groups. Over 80% of patients were treated in Group C, 32% in Group A and 46% in Group B. There was no significant difference in the severity of TR among the 3 groups early after HTx (severe TR was observed in 46%, 54%, 33%, respectively). There was no significant difference in incidence of AR (G ≥ 2 Banff classification) (23%, 23%, 33%, respectively), infections (28%, 32%, 33%, respectively) or duration of hospitalization (30, 30, 28 days, respectively). There was no correlation between pre-transplant PHT and 30-day mortality or a long-term survival. In our cohort, PHT dropped very quickly after HTx, and was not associated with acute right heart failure following the surgery. Reversible PTH does not have a negative impact on short- or long-term survival after HTx.
