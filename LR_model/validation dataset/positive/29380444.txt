Performance of existing risk scores around heart transplantation: validation study in a 4-year cohort. Several risk scores exist to help identify best candidate recipients for heart transplantation (HTx). This study describes the performance of five heart failure risk scores and two post-HTx mortality risk scores in a French single-centre cohort. All patients listed for HTx through a 4-year period were included. Waiting-list risk scores [Heart Failure Survival Score (HFSS), Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM), Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure (MAGGIC), Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) and Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure (GWTG-HF)] and post-HTx scores Index for Mortality Prediction After Cardiac Transplantation (IMPACT and CARRS) were computed. Main outcomes were 1-year mortality on waiting list and after HTx. Performance was assessed using receiver operator characteristic (ROC), calibration and goodness-of-fit analyses. The cohort included 414 patients. Waiting-list mortality was 14.0%, and post-HTx mortality was 16.3% at 1-year follow-up. Heart failure risk scores had adequate discrimination regarding waiting-list mortality (ROC AUC for HFSS = 0.68, SHFM = 0.74, OPTIMIZE-HF = 0.72, MAGGIC = 0.70 and GWTG = 0.77; all P-values <0.05). On the contrary, post-HTx risk scores did not discriminate post-HTx mortality (AUC for IMPACT = 0.58, and CARRS = 0.48, both P-values >0.50). Subgroup analysis on patients undergoing HTx after ventricular assistance device (VAD) implantation (i.e. bridge-to-transplantation) (n = 36) showed an IMPACT AUC = 0.72 (P < 0.001). In this single-centre cohort, existing heart failure risk scores were adequate to predict waiting-list mortality. Post-HTx mortality risk scores were not, except in the VAD subgroup.
