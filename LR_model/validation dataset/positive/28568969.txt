Clinical significance of anti-HLA antibodies associated with ventricular assist device use in pediatric patients: A United Network for Organ Sharing database analysis. While VAD use in pediatric patients has previously been associated with anti-HLA antibody production, the clinical significance of these antibodies is unclear. We investigated the clinical impact of anti-HLA antibodies associated with VAD use in a large cohort of pediatric HTx recipients. From 2004 to 2011, pediatric cardiomyopathy patients post-HTx (N=1288) with pre-HTx PRA levels were identified from the United Network for Organ Sharing database. PRA levels were compared between VAD patients and those with no history of MCS. Incidence of rejection and overall survival were compared between VAD and non-MCS groups after stratification by PRA and age. VAD recipients were more likely to produce anti-HLA antibodies than non-MCS patients (25.5% vs 10.5% had PRA>10%, P<.0001). Sensitized VAD patients (PRA>10%) had a higher incidence of rejection within 15 months of HTx compared to sensitized non-MCS patients (57.1% vs 35.9%, P=.02). There was no intergroup difference in 15-month mortality. Among pediatric cardiomyopathy patients supported with a VAD, the presence of anti-HLA antibodies prior to HTx is associated with an increased risk of rejection. The mechanism of the association between VAD-associated antibodies and early rejection is unclear and warrants further investigation.
