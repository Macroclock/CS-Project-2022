Outcome following heart transplantation in New Zealand Maori. Disparities in health care access and outcomes between Maori (M) and Non-Maori (NM) New Zealanders have been reported but little is known about access to and outcomes following heart transplantation (HT). A retrospective analysis was performed of M and NM who underwent HT in New Zealand. Demographic, clinical and outcome data were collected. Of 253 patients transplanted, 176 were European, 47 M (19%) and 30 of other ethnicities. M and NM groups were compared. Median age (both 46 years), gender (17% vs 21% female), waiting time (90 vs 76 days) and diagnosis (dilated cardiomyopathy - 62% vs 58%) were similar for both groups. M were heavier (81 vs 71 kg, p<0.0001) and more were blood group A (58% vs 39%). Five year survival was similar (79% vs 78%) but 10 year survival was significantly reduced in M (54% vs 67% p=0.02). The proportion of Maori who have undergone heart transplantation in New Zealand compares favourably with their proportion in the New Zealand population. The reasons for the adverse diverging outcomes after five years require further investigation. 'Culture', 'Heart transplant', 'Maori', 'Outcomes'
