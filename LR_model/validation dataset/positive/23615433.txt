Combined heart and kidney transplantation: what is the appropriate surgical sequence? Combined heart and kidney transplantation is increasing in frequency but there are no guidelines to establish the indications, contraindications and sequence for this surgical procedure. We report our single-centre experience on 30 consecutive patients who underwent combined heart and kidney transplant in comparison with heart transplant alone. Patients had similar preoperative characteristics in both groups. Combined heart and kidney transplant is associated with the same long-term survival rate, low cellular rejection and antibody-mediated rejection rates when compared with heart transplant alone. We did not observe any difference in the outcomes related to preoperative patient characteristics. We suggest the staged surgical approach as the preferred method for transplant.
