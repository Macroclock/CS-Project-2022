Extended distance cardiac allograft can successfully be utilized without impacting long-term survival. Despite the severe shortage of donor cardiac allografts, the general belief in worse outcomes with donors from prolonged distances has resulted in many centers greatly limiting the acceptable geographic distance of acceptable donors. However, with improvements in allograft preservation, it is likely that distance may be extended without compromising graft integrity. We hypothesized that recipients of appropriately selected allografts from greater distances would have equivalent long-term survival compared with recipients from closer geographic regions. We retrospectively analyzed the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) adult heart transplant data from January 2000 to December 2013. Recipients were stratified by donor distance. Demographic and outcomes data were analyzed, with a primary end-point of survival. During the study period, 25,996 isolated orthotopic heart transplantations (OHTs) were performed. Patients were stratified by distance: 0 to 500 miles (n = 24,645); 501 to 1,000 miles (n = 1,201); 1,001 to 1,500 miles (n = 134); and 1,501 Appropriately selected allografts from donors at a greater distance should be considered to increase organ availability. Donor heart procurement from increased distance may not directly increase morbidity and mortality post-heart transplant.
