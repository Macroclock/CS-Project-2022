Therapeutic apheresis in transplantation medicine, experience with cardiac and lung transplantation in Jena. Immunological problems like preformed donor specific antibodies (DSA) or high degree of immunization complicate the transplantation (TX) and can limit the therapeutic success. Essential pillars of antihumoral therapy are the extracorporeal procedures like therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and high plasma volume immunoadsorption (IA). Both extracorporeal treatments have the ability to remove pre-existing or newly formed antibodies quickly and effectively. In the last 5 years a total of 27 patients, 12 heart transplant (HTX) patients, 3 patients after combined lung and heart transplantation (Lu/HTX) and 12 lung transplant (LuTX) patients were treated for prevention (6 patients) or in case of rejection (20 patients) with TPE, cascade filtration (CF) or IA. 6 HTX recipients and 5 LuTX recipients were tested positive for HLA-ab either donor specific or de novo HLA-ab. Altogether 7 patients were tested positive for non-HLA-ab. 6 patients were treated prior to TX with 1-3 TPEs. After TX we treated 24 patients initially with TPE and performed on average 4 TPEs (1-11) for antibody elimination. 22 of 27 treated patients survived with stable graft function. The extracorporeal procedures we performed are qualified for rescue therapy of antibody mediated rejection (AMR).
