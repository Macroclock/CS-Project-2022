[Heart transplantation and ventricular assit systems]. Since the organ transplantation law was passed, we performed 50 heart transplantation at National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center. Of those, 2 patients have been doing well over 13 years and 10 years survival rate was 93.4%.During those years, we performed 139 applications of left ventricular assist systems( LVAS). Initially, extracorporeal LVASs had been used. Now, 2 implantable LVAS were approved by medical insurance as bridge to transplant in 2011. Now, our 1st option as bridge to transplantation(BTT) is implantable LVAS.
