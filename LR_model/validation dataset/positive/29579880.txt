Complex Congenital Heart Disease: Is Heart Transplantation an Option? Within the heart transplant (HT) population, few patients have complex congenital heart disease (CHD) underlying disease. Our objective is to assess the complications and follow-up of patients with CHD transplanted in our center (1991-present). Retrospective analysis of patients older than 14 years old with CHD and HT. Clinical and surgical variables were analyzed. Ten patients (age 25 ± 7 years old, 60% male) were analyzed, which represents 2.2% of the entire series of HT; 9 of the 10 patients were electively transplanted and 1 was under support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Compared with the rest of the transplanted patients, patients with CHD had a lower median age (25 [25-36] vs 53 [15-69]; P < .009); more cardiac surgeries prior to HT (100% vs 14.4%; P < .001); a lower percentage of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF; 0% vs 60%; P < .001). The left ventricle ejection fraction also showed statistically significant differences (33.5 [12-67] vs 20 [6-70]). Our patients with CHD and HT are younger and have less CVRF and more cardiac surgeries, which highlights that it is a subgroup with clear clinical differences in its comorbidity and pretransplantation assessment. They also require longer extracorporeal circulation time, more hours of intubation, and more days in the intensive care unit. Primary graft failure is more common in patients with CHD. Therefore, survival at 1-month follow-up is lower than the rest of the series and equalizes after the year of follow-up. This long-term survival reaffirms the possibility of HT in CHD despite the fact that its postoperative period is more difficult.
