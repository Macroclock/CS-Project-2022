[Heart transplantation in the 21st century in Netherlands: improved survival in the last decade]. Over the past decades donor and recipient characteristics and medical management of heart transplantations patients have changed markedly. We studied the impact of these changes on long-term clinical outcome. Data of all consecutive heart transplant recipients in our center have been collected prospectively. Cohort A (n = 353 patients) was defined as the patients transplanted between 1984 and 1999, and was compared with cohort B (n = 227 patients) transplanted between 2000 and 2013. Compared to cohort A, recipients in cohort B had older donors (mean age 29 vs. 43 years, donors aged > 50 year: 2% vs. 33%, respectively). One-year survival in cohort A vs. B was 89% vs. 86% and at 10 years 53% vs. 68%, respectively (p = 0.02). Cohort B patients were treated more often with tacrolimus based immunosuppression (77% vs. 22%; p < 0.001), and early statins post-heart transplantation (88% vs. 18%; p = 0.001), while renal function was better conserved at 5 and 10 years (p = 0.001 and 0.02). Multivariate analysis showed significant reduction in 10 years mortality with tacrolimus-based immunosuppression (HR: 0.27 and 95% CI 0.17-0.42), treatment of hypertension (HR: 0.5, 95% CI 0.36-0.72) and revascularization (HR: 0.28, 95% CI 0.15-0.52). In spite of the use of much older donors, the long-term outcome after heart transplantation has improved considerably in the last decade, probably due to the introduction of newer treatment modalities.
