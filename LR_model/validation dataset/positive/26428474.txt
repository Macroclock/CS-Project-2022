Systematic donor selection review process improves cardiac transplant volumes and outcomes. Heart transplant remains the definitive therapy for advanced heart failure patients but is limited by organ availability. We identified a large number of donor hearts from our organ procurement organization (OPO) being exported to other regions. We engaged a multidisciplinary team including transplant surgeons, cardiologists, and our OPO colleagues to identify opportunities to improve our center-specific organ utilization rate. We performed a retrospective analysis of donor offers before and after institution of a novel review process. Each donor offer made to our program was reviewed on a monthly basis from July 2013 to June 2014 and compared with the previous year. This review process resulted in a transplant utilization rate of 28% for period 1 versus 49% for period 2 (P = .007). Limiting the analysis to offers from our local OPO changed our utilization rate from 46% to 75% (P = .02). Transplant volume increased from 22 to 35 between the 2 study periods. Thirty-day and 1-year mortality were unchanged over the 2 periods. A total of 58 hearts were refused by our center and transplanted at other centers. During period 1, the 30-day and 1-year survival rates for recipients of those organs were 98% and 90%, respectively, comparable with our historical survival data. The simple process of systematically reviewing donor turndown events as a group tended to reduce variability, increase confidence in expanded criteria for donors, and resulted in improved donor organ utilization and transplant volumes.
