State of the Art of Combined Heart-Lung Transplantation for Advanced Cardiac and Pulmonary Dysfunction. Over the last several decades, significant advances and improvements in care of transplant patients have resulted in markedly improved outcomes. A number of options are available for patients with advanced cardiopulmonary dysfunction requiring transplantation. There is a debate about when isolated heart or isolated lung transplantation is no longer possible or advisable and combined heart-lung transplantation is justified. Organ availability and allocation severely limit the latter option to very few well-selected patients. We review practice patterns, trends, and outcomes after triple-organ heart-lung transplant (HLTx) worldwide, as well as our own experience with heart-lung transplant in the modern era.
