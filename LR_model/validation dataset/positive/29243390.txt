Aquaporin 4 blockade improves survival of murine heart allografts subjected to prolonged cold ischemia. Prolonged cold ischemia storage (CIS) is a leading risk factor for poor transplant outcome. Existing strategies strive to minimize ischemia-reperfusion injury in transplanted organs, yet there is a need for novel approaches to improve outcomes of marginal allografts and expand the pool of donor organs suitable for transplantation. Aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of water channels that facilitate homeostasis, tissue injury, and inflammation. We tested whether inhibition of AQP4 improves the survival of fully MHC-mismatched murine cardiac allografts subjected to 8Â hours of CIS. Administration of a small molecule AQP4 inhibitor during donor heart collection and storage and for a short-time posttransplantation improves the viability of donor graft cells, diminishes donor-reactive T cell responses, and extends allograft survival in the absence of other immunosuppression. Furthermore, AQP4 inhibition is synergistic with cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4-Ig in prolonging survival of 8-hour CIS heart allografts. AQP4 blockade markedly reduced T cell proliferation and cytokine production in vitro, suggesting that the improved graft survival is at least in part mediated through direct effects on donor-reactive T cells. These results identify AQPs as a promising target for diminishing donor-specific alloreactivity and improving the survival of high-risk organ transplants.
