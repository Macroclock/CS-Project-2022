Improved Survival While Waiting and Risk Factors for Death in Pediatric Patients Listed for Cardiac Transplantation. Our aim is to determine (a) the effect of changes in pre-transplant management and era of listing on survival of children listed for HTx and (b) risk factors for death while waiting. This retrospective study included all children listed between 1/1993 and 12/2009 at our center. Survival was determined using survival analysis and competing outcomes modeling. There were 254 listed patients of whom 144 (57%) had congenital heart disease, 208 (82%) were status 1, 52 used ECMO (20%), and 28 used ventricular assist device support (VAD) (11%) beginning in 2005. Overall mortality while waiting was 17% at 6 months, and 69% underwent transplant. Seven of 95 patients (7%) died waiting after 2004 compared to 36 of 159 (23%) before. ECMO and earlier year of listing were significant risk factors (p < 0.001) for wait-list mortality, whereas mortality was significantly lower (p = 0.002) after availability of VADs. Race, gender, blood type, and congenital diagnosis were not significant risk factors for death. Survival in pediatric patients listed for HTx has improved significantly in the current era at our institution. The availability of pediatric VADs has had a significant impact on survival while waiting in children listed for transplantation. 'Children', 'Heart transplantation', 'VAD', 'Wait-list mortality'
