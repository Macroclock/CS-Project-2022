Heart transplantation and left ventricular assist device therapy: two comparable options in end-stage heart failure? Heart transplantation is the only curative therapy for chronic heart failure, and it plays an important role in the treatment of chronic heart failure with a survival rate of approximately 50% of all patients after 10â€‰years. This has to be kept in mind when alternative therapies enter into our daily routine in treating this patient population. However, the shortage of appropriate donor organs and the expanding pool of patients waiting for heart transplantation have led to growing interest in alternative strategies, particularly in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy. With growing clinical experience and continued technical advances, continuous-flow pumps are evolving as a bridge to transplantation or as a destination therapy for advanced heart failure. Nevertheless, the importance of this new indication of chronic cardiac support compared to heart transplantation is still completely open and the object of controversial ongoing discussion. This review (1) describes the clinical use and long-term outcome of a currently available miniaturized LVAD in the context to the standard of care-heart transplantation, (2) provides an outlook of the ongoing process of further optimization of LVADs, and (3) comments on the challenges with assist devices as alternatives to transplantation with a 5-year outlook.
