Outcome of pediatric heart transplantation in blood culture positive donors in the United States. Active donor infection at the time of organ procurement poses a potential infection risk and may increase post-transplant morbidity and mortality in recipients. Our hypothesis was that pediatric heart transplant recipients from blood culture positive donors (BCPD) would have increased morbidity and mortality compared to non-blood culture positive donors (NBCPD). A retrospective analysis of pediatric heart transplant recipients using the organ procurement and transplant network (OPTN) between 1987 and 2015 was conducted. Recipient as well as donor data were analyzed. Propensity score matching with 1:2 ratios was performed for recipient variables. Post-transplant morbidity and mortality were compared for recipients of BCPD and NBCPD. Among 9618 heart transplant recipients, 450 (4.7%) were from culture positive donors. Recipients of BCPD had longer duration of listing as Status 1; diagnosis of congenital heart disease or restrictive cardiomyopathy and required support (IV inotropes, Inhaled NO and LVAD) prior to transplant. Post-transplant survival between the 2 groups was not different. Propensity-matched recipients had similar length of stay; stroke rate; need for dialysis; pacemaker implantation and treated rejection episodes in the first year post-transplant. Careful acceptance of BCPD may have the potential to increase availability of donor hearts in the pediatric population.
