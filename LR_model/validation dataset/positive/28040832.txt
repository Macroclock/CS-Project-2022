Renal transplantation outcomes following heart and heart-lung transplantation. Chronic kidney disease is a frequent complication following heart and combined heart-lung transplantation. The aim of this study was to analyse the outcome of a subsequent renal transplant in heart, lung and heart-lung transplantation recipients. All heart, lung and heart-lung transplant recipients who received a subsequent renal transplant over a 27-year period in a national heart and lung transplant centre were included in this study. A total of 18 patients who had previously undergone heart (n = 6), lung (n = 7) and heart-lung (n = 5) transplantation received a renal transplant. The mean duration to development of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) was 115 ± 45.9 months. The most common contributor to ESKD was calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity. The 5-year patient survival and graft survival rates were 91.7 and 85.6%, respectively. The median creatinine level at the most recent follow-up was 123 μmol/L, IQR 90.8-147.5. The overall outcome of renal transplantation following previous non-renal solid organ transplantation is excellent considering the medical complexity and co-morbidities of this patient population. Renal transplantation represents an important treatment option for ESKD in non-renal solid organ transplant recipients. 'Heart', 'Lung', 'Outcomes', 'Renal transplant'
