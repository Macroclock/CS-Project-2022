HLA compatibility index: does it have a role in patients after heart transplantation? To determine the impact of HLA compatibility measured by the Compatibility Index, on survival, rate of rejections, malignancies and infections in patients after heart transplantation (HTx). We carried out a retrospective analysis of 182 consecutive patients who underwent heart transplantation in our center from January 2001 to April 2010. According to degree of HLA-A, B and DR matching (Compatibility Index, CI) the patients were divided in two groups, Group A (n=83) with an IC 0-17 and group B (n=99) with an IC 18-26. There was no significant difference in demographic parameters between recipients and donors. We found no difference in rates of rejections or infections between Group A and Group B (AR: 22 (26.5%) vs. 34 (34.3%), P=0.2539; infections: 21 (25.3%) vs. 27 (27%) P=0.7637). The distribution of infections in terms of type (bacterial, viral, fungal, including Aspergillus) was similar in both groups. The incidence of malignant tumours was infrequent (3 (3.6%) vs. 4 (4.0%), P=0.8817). We found trend toward lower level of tacrolimus in Group A. Long term survival was similar in both groups. Based on the results of our single-center trial, we found no impact of higher degree of HLA-A,-B, and -DR matching on survival, rejection episodes or infection. Further large studies are necessary to confirm our hypothesis that subjects with better HLA compatibility could require lower dose immunosuppression.
