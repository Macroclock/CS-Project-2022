Paediatric heart transplantation in Australia comes of age: 21 years of experience in a national centre. Heart transplantation (HT) is established therapy for end-stage heart failure in children with cardiomyopathy or congenital heart disease. This review summarises experience at a national referral centre since the first local transplant. Medical records of children referred for HT between 1 April 1988 and 1 January 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients listed for HT were included. Survival analysis was used to summarise wait-list time to death/transplant, and separately, time to death in HT patients. One hundred and thirty-nine children were accepted on to the HT waiting list during the study (median age 7.7 (interquartile range (IQR) 2.5, 13.6) years), of whom 93 underwent HT (median age 10.9 (IQR 4.4, 14.6) years). Wait-list mortality was 32% (45 of 139 patients), lowest among children aged >10 years at listing (P < 0.001). Median time to HT was 69 days (range 29-146). Survival post-transplantation was 90% (95% confidence interval 82-95) at 1 year, 82% (72-89%) at 5 years and 68% (50-80%) at 10 years. Increasing case complexity over the study period included pre- and post-transplant circulatory support, management of pulmonary hypertension and introduction of ABO-incompatible HT for infants. Post-transplant survival did not vary according to age, pre-transplant diagnosis or use of pre-transplant circulatory support (all P > 0.05). Results of paediatric HT in Australia are comparable with international results, despite limitations of geographic isolation, small population and low organ donation rate. Increasing case complexity has not impacted on post-transplant survival. 'heart transplantation', 'paediatric'
