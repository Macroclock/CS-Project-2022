Heart transplant survival rate in Iran: a single-center registry report. to determine 1-month and 1-year survival rate in recipients of heart transplants in Imam Khomeini Medical Center. we analyzed the outcomes of 69 patients who underwent heart transplantation between 2007 and 2010. The 1-month and 1-year survival rates were calculated, and we assessed prognostic factors such as donor and recipient age and sex, graft ischemic time during surgery, and liver and kidney function tests. increased donor age had a significant negative effect on survival rate (p = 0.005). Sex differences between donor and recipient had no association with transplant outcome and survival rate. The overall 1-month and 1-year survival was 82.6% (n = 54) and 70% (n = 48), respectively. heart transplantation is a lifesaving procedure for end-stage heart disorders. Mortality after heart transplantation depends on numerous factors, and thus survival rates differ among centers. The 1-month and 1-year survival rates after heart transplant in our center currently stand at 82.6% and 70%, respectively.
