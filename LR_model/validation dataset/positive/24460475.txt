Preoperative pulmonary hypertension and its impact on survival after heart transplantation. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) due to left heart disease may impair outcome after heart transplantation (HT). To evaluate to what extent previous, and present, haemodynamic criteria discriminate the impact of pre-operative-PH on survival, we characterized the PH in our HT-patients according to ESC's guidelines, ISHLT's summary statement and ISHLT's relative contraindications and criteria for early risk of death after HT. Records from the 215 HT-patients in Lund during 1988-2010 were reviewed. Subsequent analysis included adults (n = 94) evaluated with right-heart-catheterization at our lab, at rest before HT. End of follow-up was 30th of June 2012. Survival (mean, n) did not differ (p = ns) for the 94 HT-patients; without (13.0 years, n = 28) or with (13.9 years, n = 66) PH, passive (13.8 years, n = 50) or reactive (12.2 years, n = 13) post-capillary-PH, "modified" passive (13.1 years, n = 40), mixed (16.6 years, n = 23), "modified" reactive (12.6 years, n = 7) or non-reactive (12.2 years, n = 8) post-capillary-PH; or for ISHLT's relative contraindications (12.0 years, n = 22) or increased risk of right-heart-failure and early death (16.5 years, n = 23) after HT. As previous and present haemodynamic criteria did not sufficiently discriminate the impact of pre-operative-PH for survival after HT at our centre, larger multi-centre studies are encouraged to redefine criteria that may influence outcome.
