Rituximab Therapy for Rejection in Pediatric Heart Transplant. Humoral rejection is the B-cell-mediated production of immunoglobulin G antibody against the transplanted heart. Antibody-mediated rejection may be resistant to standard immunosuppressive therapy and is associated with high mortality and graft loss. Rituximab can be used to treat antibody-mediated rejection in heart transplant recipients. This retrospective study describes our experience with rituximab treatment in children with heart transplants. We present 7 pediatric patients with antibody-mediated rejection who were treated with plasma exchange and rituximab therapy. Rituximab was given at a dose of 375 mg/m2 by slow infusion in the intensive care unit after 5 days of plasmapheresis, in addition to a conventional regimen consisting of steroids, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus. The peripheral blood count and sodium, potassium, serum urea nitrogen, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase levels were measured in all patients before and after treatment. Seven patients were treated with plasma exchange and rituximab. We repeated this therapy in 5 patients because of refractoriness or recurrent rejection. After diagnoses of antibody-mediated rejection, 4 patients died within 6 months (mortality rate of 57.1%). We did not observe any adverse effects or complications related to rituximab. Rituximab can be used in humoral rejection after pediatric heart transplant. However, the success of the treatment is controversial, and further study is needed to find an effective treatment for antibody-mediated rejection and steroid-resistant cellular rejection in children.
