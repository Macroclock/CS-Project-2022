Heart transplantation for end-stage heart failure due to cardiac sarcoidosis. Cardiac sarcoidosis with end-stage heart failure has a poor prognosis without transplantation. The rates of sarcoid recurrence and rejection are not well established after heart transplantation. A total of 19 heart transplant recipients with sarcoid of the explanted heart were compared with a contemporaneous control group of 1,050 heart transplant recipients without cardiac sarcoidosis. Assessed outcomes included 1st-year freedom from any treated rejection, 5-year actuarial survival, 5-year freedom from cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), 5-year freedom from nonfatal major adverse cardiac events (NF-MACE), and recurrence of sarcoid in the allograft or other organs. Patients with sarcoidosis were maintained on low-dose corticosteroids after transplantation. There were no significant differences between the sarcoid and control groups in 1st-year freedom from any treated rejection (79% and 90%), 5-year posttransplantation survival (79% and 83%), 5-year freedom from CAV (68% and 78%), and 5-year freedom from NF-MACE (90% and 88%). Causes of death (nÂ = 5) in the sarcoid group were coccidioidomycosis, pneumonia, rejection, hemorrhage, and CAV. No patient had recurrence of sarcoidosis in the cardiac allograft. Three of 19 patients (16%) experienced recurrence of extracardiac sarcoid, with no mortality. Patients with cardiac sarcoidosis undergoing heart transplantation have acceptable long-term outcomes without evidence of recurrence of sarcoidosis in the allograft when maintained on low-dose corticosteroids. Progression of extracardiac sarcoid was uncommon, possibly related to immunosuppression. In patients with cardiac sarcoidosis, heart transplantation is a viable treatment modality.
