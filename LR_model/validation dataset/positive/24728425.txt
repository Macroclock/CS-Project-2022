[Clinical experience with 53 consecutive heart transplants]. Heart transplantation is the therapy of choice for advance heart failure. Our group developed two transplant programs at Instituto Nacional del Tórax and Clínica Dávila. We report our clinical experience based on distinctive clinical policies. Fifty-three consecutive patients were transplanted between November 2008 and April 2013, representing 51% of all Chilean cases. Distinctive clinical policies include intensive donor management, generic immunosuppression and VAD (ventricular assist devices) insertion. Ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy were the main indications (23 (43%) each), age 48 ± 13 years and 48 (91%) were male. Transplant listing Status: IA 14 (26%) (VAD or 2 inotropes), IB 14 (26%) (1 inotrope) and II25 (47%) (no inotrope). Mean waiting time 70 ± 83 days. Twelve (24%) were transplanted during VAD support (median support: 36 days). orthotopic bicaval transplant with ischemia time: 175 ± 54 min. Operative mortality: 3 (6%), all due to right ventricular failure. Re-exploration for bleeding 2 (4%), stroke 3 (6%), mediastinitis 0 (0%), pneumonia 4 (8%), and transient dialysis 6 (11%). Mean follow-up was 21 ± 14 months. Three-year survival was 86 ± 6%. One patient died of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and the other died suddenly (non-compliance). Freedom from rejection requiring specific therapy was 80 ± 7% at 3 years of follow-up. Four hundred eighty four endomyocardial biopsies were done: 11 (2.3%) had 2R rejection. All survivors are in NYHA (New York Heart Association) functional class I and all but one have normal biventricular function. Mid-term results are similar to those reported by the registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation. This experience has a higher proportion of VAD support than previous national series. Rejection rates are low in spite of generic immunosuppression.
