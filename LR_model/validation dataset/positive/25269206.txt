[Postoperative complications after orthotopic heart transplantation]. We analysed postoperative complications in 106 patients after orthotopic heart transplantation based on the results of prospective observations during 2 year follow-up. Survival was estimated at 83% (88 patients). Deaths were caused by pyoseptic complications, pulmonary thromboembolism, acute pancreatitis, cardiac arrhythmia or transplant rejection due to non-compliance with the immunotherapeutic regime. The most frequent causes of deaths were pneumonia (28.3%), transplant rejection (11.3%), steroid-induced diabetes (14.6%). It is concluded that heart transplantation should be followed by thorough observation of the patients based at a specialized multi-field clinic to ensure continuous treatment and reduce lethality. Risk factors of unfavourable prognosis of heart transplantation are identified.
