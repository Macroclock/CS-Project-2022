Intraoperative use of several inotropes is associated with increased mid-term mortality in patients undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation. Orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) is the gold standard treatment for patients with end-stage heart failure. Inotropic agents are the hemodynamic mainstay in the treatment of implanted donor hearts. However, their infusion, particularly in excess, can have unintended consequences that lead to cardiac toxicity and can originate malignant arrhythmias, myocardial necrosis, and myocyte apoptosis. The aim of the study was to determine the perioperative predictors of mid-term mortality after OHT. We retrospectively studied all consecutive adult patients who underwent OHT between January 2009 and July 2013 at a tertiary care university hospital and followed them up until July 2013. Donor and recipient demographic data, hemodynamic profile, and perioperative data were analyzed. The primary endpoint was mid-term survival. The overall survival rate was 80.6% during hospitalization time and 70.1% after 328 (interquartile range, 643) days of follow-up. The univariate analysis showed that patients who died were older, had lower height and body surface area, donor/recipient (D/R) mismatch, prior cardiac surgery, longer cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time, postoperative lower left ventricular ejection fraction, sepsis, and primary graft dysfunction. Using Cox survival analysis, the independent risk factors related to mid-term mortality were intraoperative use of more than 2 inotropic drugs (hazard ratio [HR], 3.887; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.224-12.342; P = .021), CPB duration (HR, 1.008; 95% CI, 1.003-1.014; P = .002), and D/R weight ratio (HR, 1.027; 95% CI, 1.009-1.046; P = .003). In patients undergoing OHT, mid-term survival was mostly related to D/R weight mismatch and intraoperative factors, mainly inotropic drugs and CPB duration.
