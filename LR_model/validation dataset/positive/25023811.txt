Does the UNOS heart transplant allocation system favor men over women? The aim of this paper was to identify sex differences in survival of patients awaiting orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). Women have a higher mortality rate while awaiting OHT than men, and the reason has not been fully determined. We included all adult patients in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) placed on the OHT waiting list from 2000 to 2010. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality before receiving OHT, analyzed using time-to-event analysis. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate sex differences in survival, with data stratified by United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) status at time of listing. There were 28,852 patients (24% women) awaiting OHT. This cohort included 6,163 UNOS status 1A (25% women), 9,168 UNOS status 1B (25% women), and 13,521 UNOS status 2 (24% women) patients. During a median follow-up of 3.7 years, 1,290 women and 4,286 men died. Female sex was associated with a significant risk of death among UNOS status 1A (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05 to 1.37, p = 0.01) after adjusting for more than 30 baseline variables. In contrast, female sex was significantly protective for time to death among UNOS status 2 patients (adjusted HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.84, p < 0.001). No sex differences were noted among UNOS status 1B patients. There are sex differences in survival between women and men awaiting heart transplantation, and the current UNOS transplant criteria do not account for this disparity.
