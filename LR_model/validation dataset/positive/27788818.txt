Similar Mortality and Morbidity of Orthotopic Heart Transplantation for Patients 70 Years of Age and Older Compared With Younger Patients. The upper age limit of heart transplantation remains controversial. The goal of the present study was to investigate the mortality and morbidity of orthotopic heart transplantation (HT) for recipients ≥70 compared with those <70 years of age. Of 704 adults who underwent HT from December 1988 to June 2012 at our institution, 45 were ≥70 years old (older group) and 659 were <70 years old (younger group). Survival, intraoperative blood product usage, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays, and frequency of reoperation for chest bleeding, dialysis, and >48 hours ventilation were examined after HT. The older group had 100% 30-day and 60-day survival compared with 96.8 ± 0.7% 30-day and 95.9 ± 0.8% 60-day survival rates in the younger group. The older and younger groups had similar 1-year (93.0 ± 3.9% vs 92.1 ± 1.1%; P = .79), 5-year (84.2 ± 6.0% vs 73.4 ± 1.9%; P = .18), and 10-year (51.2 ± 10.7% vs 50.2 ± 2.5%; P = .43) survival rates. Recipients in the older group had higher preoperative creatinine levels, frequency of coronary artery disease, and more United Network for Organ Sharing status 2 and fewer status 1 designations than recipients in the younger group (P < .05 for all). Pump time and intraoperative blood usage were similar between the 2 groups (P = NS); however, donor-heart ischemia time was higher in the older group (P = .002). Older recipients had higher postoperative creatinine levels at peak (P = .003) and at discharge (P = .007). Frequency of postoperative complications, including reoperation for chest bleeding, dialysis, >48 hours ventilation, pneumonia, pneumothorax, sepsis, in-hospital and post-discharge infections, were similar between groups (P = NS for all comparisons). ICU and hospital length of stays were similar between groups (P = .35 and P = .87, respectively). In Cox analysis, recipient age ≥70 years was not identified as a predictor of lower long-term survival after HT. HT recipients ≥70 years old had similar 1, 5, and 10-year survival rates compared with younger recipients. Both patient groups had similar intra- and postoperative blood utilization and frequencies of many postoperative complications. Older and younger patients had similar morbidity and mortality rates following HT. Carefully selected older patients (≥70 years) can safely undergo HT and should not be excluded from HT consideration based solely on age.
