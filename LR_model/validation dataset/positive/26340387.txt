Novel insights into pretransplant allosensitization in heart transplant recipients in the contemporary era of immunosuppression and rejection surveillance. Solid-phase assays (SPA) have facilitated detection and definition of antibodies to human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related antigen A (MICA). However, clinical consequences of pretransplant SPA results in heart transplantation have been studied insufficiently in the current era of immunosuppression and rejection surveillance. Pretransplant sera, panel-reactive antibodies (PRA), pretransplant crossmatch, and clinical data were retrospectively analyzed in 264 adult heart transplant recipients. The specificity of HLA and MICA antibodies and C1q-binding activity of donor-specific antibodies (DSA) were defined using SPA. Pretransplant HLA antibodies were detected in 57 (22%) individuals, in 28 individuals (11%); these antibodies were DSA after transplant. Preformed DSA and elevated peak PRA were independent predictors of pathologic AMR, which occurred in 19 individuals (7%). The increasing number of DSA and the cumulative mean fluorescence intensity of DSA were associated with AMR. C1q-binding assay was a suboptimal predictor of AMR in our cohort. Pretransplant allosensitization and MICA antibodies were related neither to impaired graft survival nor to other adverse clinical events during a median follow-up of 39 months. Identification of preformed DSA by SPA, in addition to PRA monitoring, may predict AMR in the contemporary era of heart transplantation.
