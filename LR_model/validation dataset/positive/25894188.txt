A single-center retrospective clinicopathologic study of endomyocardial biopsies after heart transplant at Baskent University Hospital in Ankara, 1993-2014. The purpose of this study was to investigate the frequency and prognostic importance of acute cellular rejection after heart transplant. All 84 heart transplant patients at our center from January 1993 to January 2014, including all 576 endomyocardial biopsies, were evaluated with retrospective review of clinical records and endomyocardial biopsies. Routine and clinically indicated endomyocardial biopsies after heart transplant were graded for acute cellular rejection (2005 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Working Formulation). Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method. There were 61 male (73%) and 23 female recipients. Median age at heart transplant was 29 years (range, 1-62 y). Posttransplant early mortality rate was 17.9% (15 patients). In the other 69 patients, 23 patients died and 46 patients (66.7%) were alive at mean 69.3 ± 7.2 months after heart transplant. Mean follow-up was 35.4 ± 29.8 months (range, 0.07-117.5 mo). Mean 8.4 ± 4.2 endomyocardial biopsies (range, 1-19 biopsies) were performed per patient. Median first biopsy time was 7 days (range, 1-78 d). The frequency of posttransplant acute cellular rejection was 63.8% (44 of 69 patients) by histopathology; 86% patients experienced the first episode of acute cellular rejection within 6 months after transplant. There were 18 patients with acute cellular rejection ≥ grade 2R on ≥ 1 endomyocardial biopsy in 44 patients with acute cellular rejection. No significant difference was observed between survival rates of patients with grade 1R or ≥ grade 2R acute cellular rejection, or between survival rates of patients with or without diagnosis of any grade of acute cellular rejection. Acute cellular rejection was not related to any prognostic risk factor. Acute cellular rejection had no negative effect on heart recipient long-term survival, but it was a frequent complication after heart transplant, especially within the first 6 months.
