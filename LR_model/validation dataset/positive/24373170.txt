OPTN/SRTR 2012 Annual Data Report: heart. The number of heart transplants performed annually continues to increase gradually, and the number of adult candidates on the waiting list increased by 25% from 2004 to 2012. The heart transplant rate among active adult candidates peaked at 149 per 100 wait-list years in 2007 and has been declining since; in 2012, the rate was 93 heart transplants per 100 active wait-list years. Increased waiting times do not appear to be correlated with an overall increase in wait-list mortality. Since 2007, the proportion of patients on life support before transplant increased from 48.6% to 62.7% in 2012. Medical urgency categories have become less distinct, with most patients listed in higher urgency categories. Approximately 500 pediatric candidates are added to the waiting list each year; the number of transplants performed each year increased from 274 in 1998 to 372 in 2012. Graft survival in pediatric recipients continues to improve; 5-year graft survival for transplants performed in 2007 was 78.5%. Medicare paid for some or all of the care for nearly 40% of heart transplant recipients in 2010. Heart transplant appears to be more expensive than ventricular assist devices for managing end-stage heart failure, but is more effective and likely more cost-effective.
