Individualized approach in the management of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). Over the past decade new variations on the "classic" first stage palliation (the Norwood/BT shunt) for patients with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome have emerged and been vetted by the medical community. A "one size fits all" approach may not be adequate anymore. In this review, the optimal indications for the various palliative options (Norwood/BT shunt, Norwood/RV-PA conduit, Hybrid Stage I with or without ductal stenting, heart transplantation) are reviewed from a standpoint of the initial anatomy and physiology of the patient, letting it guide clinical management. Current knowledge useful for decision-making is also reviewed as objectively as possible.
