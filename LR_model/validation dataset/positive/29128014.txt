Overview of Lung Transplantation, Heart-Lung Transplantation, Liver-Lung Transplantation, and Combined Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Lung Transplantation. Lung transplantation (LTx) has evolved to represent the therapy of choice for many patients with end-stage lung diseases. Appropriate candidate selection for LTx is an important determinant of a positive outcome from transplantation. Posttransplantation survival has steadily improved, but long-term survival continues to be a challenge with a median survival of 5.8 years. Similarly, combined heart-lung transplantation and simultaneous liver-lung transplantation has been performed successfully in select patients who are not expected to survive either organ transplant alone. Moreover, LTx has been performed in patients who develop end-stage pulmonary complications following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
