Posttransplant Pulmonary Hypertension Is Correlated With Acute Rejection and Death Among Cardiac Transplant Recipients: A Single Center Study. Endomyocardial biopsy sampling is used to check acute rejection after cardiac transplant. However, it may lead to tricuspid valve injury and cardiac perforation; therefore, less invasive tools may be useful. Right heart catheterization provides valuable information about cardiac hemodynamics. Herein, we aimed to determine the correlation of right heart catheterization parameters with acute rejection and death during cardiac transplant follow-up. We retrospectively evaluated follow-up right heart catheterization and endomyocardial biopsy results from 47 adult patients who underwent cardiac transplant at Başkent University Faculty of Medicine between 2004 and 2016. Right heart catheterization parameters were compared between deceased and surviving patients and were correlated with acute cellular and humoral rejection. Averaged right heart catheterization parameters were correlated with death. We used Cox regression analysis to determine risk of death and acute cellular rejection and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to determine any survival differences associated with pulmonary hypertension. There were 47 patients (38 males, 9 females) with a mean age of 44 ± 10 years at transplant. In our patient group, 18 patients (38.3%) died at a median time of 11.2 months. Ninety endomyocardial biopsy samples (22.1%) showed cellular rejection, and 61 samples (4.5%) showed humoral rejection. The deceased patients had significantly greater mean and systolic pulmonary artery pressures, which were significantly correlated with acute cellular rejection. Death was significantly correlated with averaged values of mean and systolic pulmonary artery pressures. Our Cox regression analysis revealed that pulmonary hypertension was significantly associated with risk of death and acute cellular rejection. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that pulmonary hypertension was associated with a significantly lower median survival. Pulmonary artery pressures are significantly correlated with acute cellular rejection and death after cardiac transplant. Pulmonary hypertension significantly increases the risk of death and shortens survival after cardiac transplant.
