Utilization of high donor sequence number grafts in cardiac transplantation. Donor sequence number (DSN) represents the number of candidates to whom a graft was offered and declined prior to acceptance for transplantation. We sought to investigate the outcomes of patients receiving high DSN grafts. Consecutive isolated adult cardiac transplantations performed at a single-center were reviewed. Recipients were grouped into standard (≤75th percentile) DSN and high (>75th percentile) DSN. A previously validated donor risk index was used to quantify the risk associated with donor grafts, and recipient outcomes were assessed. Overall, 254 patients were included: 194 standard DSN (range 1-79) and 60 high DSN (range 82-1723). High DSN grafts were harvested at greater distance (P < .001) with increased ischemia time (P < .001), resulting in a modest increase in donor risk index (1 point median difference, P = .014). High DSN recipients were less frequently listed as UNOS status 1A (P < .001). Despite a nonsignificant trend toward increased in-hospital/30-day mortality in high DSN recipients, there were no differences in primary graft dysfunction or 1-year survival (high DSN 89% vs standard DSN 88%, P = .82). After adjustment for risk factors, high DSN was not associated with increased 1-year mortality (hazard ratio 1.18, 95%-CI 0.54-2.58, P = .68).
