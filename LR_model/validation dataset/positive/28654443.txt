Application and interpretation of histocompatibility data in thoracic (heart and lung) transplantation. The purpose of the review is to update our current understanding and utilization of immunogenetic tools in heart and lung transplant. Increasingly, complex patients have been managed perioperatively for heart and lung transplant using a variety of tests and techniques. Recent treatment regimens and listing strategies have exploited recent laboratory advances. However, the better characterization has led to an even more complex description of sensitized heart and lung candidates. Several recent studies have examined antibody strengths and behavior to guide clinical decision-making and examine postoperative outcomes. Finally, non-human leukocyte antigen antibodies have emerged as possible determinants of allograft outcome in heart and lung transplant. Heart and lung transplant candidates with preformed and de-novo posttransplant antibodies continue to represent a challenging and high-risk group of patients. Modern immunogenetic techniques have broadened our understanding and have revealed an even more complex relationship between antibodies, allografts, and outcomes.
