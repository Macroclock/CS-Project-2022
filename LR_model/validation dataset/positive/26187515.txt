Influence of Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder on Survival in Children After Heart Transplantation. The influence of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) on long-term survival in children after heart transplantation (HTx) is not well studied. The United Network for Organ Sharing database was queried from 1987 to 2013 for data on PTLD in relation to induction immunosuppression and recipient Epstein-Barr virus status in children (<18 years of age) who underwent HTx. Of 6818 first-time pediatric heart transplants, 5169 had follow-up data on posttransplant malignancy, with 360 being diagnosed with PTLD. Univariate Cox analysis identified diminished survival after PTLD onset using a time-varying measure of PTLD (HR 2.208; 95 % CI 1.812, 2.689; p < 0.001), although Kaplan-Meier survival functions found no difference in survival between the group ever diagnosed with PTLD and the non-PTLD reference group (log-rank test: χ 1 (2)  = 0.02; p = 0.928). A multivariate Cox model found a greater mortality hazard associated with the development of PTLD after adjusting for recipient EBV seronegativity and other covariates (HR 3.024; 95 % CI 1.902, 4.808; p < 0.001). Induction immunosuppression at time of HTx did not significantly influence posttransplant mortality. The development of PTLD adversely influenced long-term survival in children after HTx after adjusting for confounding variables.
