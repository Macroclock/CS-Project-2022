The joint impact of donor and recipient parameters on the outcome of heart transplantation in Germany after graft allocation. Organ shortage in heart transplantation (HTx) results in increased use of grafts from donors with substantial risk factors. It is discussed controversially which donor characteristics may be detrimental. Therefore, we evaluated the joint impact of donor- and patient-related risk factors in HTx on patient survival by multiple analysis in a nationwide multicentre study after donor selection was carried out. The research database consists of data concerning hearts donated and transplanted in Germany between 2006 and 2008 as provided by Deutsche Stiftung Organtransplantation and the BQS Institute. Multiple Cox regression (significance level 5%, hazard ratio [95% CI]) was conducted (n = 774, recipient age ≥ 18 years). Survival was significantly decreased by donor age (1.021 [1.008-1.035] per year), nontraumatic cause of death (1.481 [1.079-2.034]), troponin >0.1 ng/ml (2.075 [1.473-2.921]), ischaemia time (1.197 [1.041-1.373] per hour), recipient age (1.017 [1.002-1.031] per year) and in recipients with pulmonary vascular resistance ≥ 320 dyn*s*cm(-5) (1.761 [1.115-2.781]), with ventilator dependency (3.174 [2.211-6.340]) or complex previous heart surgery (1.763 [1.270-2.449]). After donor selection had been conducted, multiple Cox regression revealed donor age, nontraumatic cause of death, troponin and ischaemia time as well as recipient age, pulmonary hypertension, ventilator dependency and previous complex heart surgery as limiting risk factors concerning patient survival.
