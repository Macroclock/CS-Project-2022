Impact of postoperative pulmonary hypertension on outcome after heart transplantation. We wanted to investigate the effects of postoperative pulmonary hypertension (PH Eighty-nine patients who underwent HT at Sk√•ne University Hospital in Lund in the period 1988-2010 and who were evaluated with right-heart-catheterization at rest, prior to HT and repeatedly during the first postoperative year, were grouped based on their MPAP, DPG, and PVR. One year after HT, survival was lower in patients with PH When defined according to present guidelines, PH one year after HT may emerge as a prognostic marker for long-term outcome after HT. Moreover, PH 'Diastolic pressure gradient', 'heart transplantation', 'pulmonary hypertension', 'pulmonary vascular resistance', 'right heart catheterization', 'survival'
