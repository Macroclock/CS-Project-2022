Prognostic role of myocardial performance index on long-term survival after heart transplantation: a prospective study. The survival rate of heart transplant patients is increasing, underlying the need for accurate predictors of adverse events during clinical follow-up. Myocardial performance index (MPI) is a Doppler-derived index of combined systolic and diastolic function: we assessed the prognostic role of MPI in survival of patients >1 year after heart transplantation (HT). A total of 152 consecutive HT patients referred to our institution were enrolled in this prospective study. Primary endpoints were cardiac death and a composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). During follow-up (69 ± 22 months), 68 (44.7%) patients had an adverse event and 20 (13.15%) patients died. Patients with MACE during follow-up showed lower EF (57.3 ± 9.3 vs. 63 ± 6.1; P < 0.001) and higher MPI (0.45 ± 0.19 vs. 0.31 ± 0.13; P < 0.001) at enrolment. MPI and EF were independently related to MACE (OR = 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-5.1; and OR = 6.6; 95% CI = 3.5-11.2, respectively) and showed strong diagnostic power (MPI: receiver operating characteristic [ROC] area = 79%, with 79% sensitivity and 81% specificity; EF: ROC area = 77%, with 54% sensitivity and 91% specificity) in the subsequent year. Patients with EF > 50% and MPI < 0.45 at enrolment showed 75% event-free survival 5 years after HT. In HT patients, MPI combined with EF was an accurate means of predicting long-term adverse events.
