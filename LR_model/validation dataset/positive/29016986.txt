Retained pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator components after heart transplantation are common and may lead to adverse events. Many patients have a cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) extracted at the time of heart transplantation. CIED components may be retained after heart transplantation, but their frequency, nature, and clinical significance is uncertain. Consecutive patients that underwent heart transplantation over 10â€‰years from 1 January 2007 until 1 January 2017 were identified from the unit database. Pre- and post-operative chest radiographs were reviewed by two independent observers for the presence of CIED components. Adverse events relating to any retained CIED component were recorded. Two hundred and six patients had a CIED removed at the time of transplantation. Retained CIED components were present in 86 (42%) patients. The most common retained CIED components were suture sleeves and superior vena cava (SVC) coils of dual coil implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) leads. An SVC coil was retained in 25% of patients that had a dual coil ICD lead. Seven adverse events were associated with CIED removal or retained CIED components, including one fatal event. However, retained CIED components were not associated with reduced long-term survival after heart transplantation. Retained CIED components were seen in 42% of patients that had a CIED prior to transplantation, may be associated with serious adverse events but are not associated with reduced long-term survival. Cardiac surgeons should be aware of all CIED system components and be familiar with techniques for their complete removal at the time of transplantation.
