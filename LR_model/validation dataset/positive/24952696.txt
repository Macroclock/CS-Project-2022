Long-term mortality after cardiac allograft vasculopathy: implications of percutaneous intervention. This study compared the prognosis of patients with proximal cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) treated with percutaneous intervention (PCI) to the prognosis of those with severe CAV not amenable to PCI. CAV is a progressive form of arterial narrowing affecting patients with orthotopic heart transplants (OHTs). PCI has been used to treat patients with focal CAV, but its efficacy remains unclear. Of 853 patients undergoing OHT and subsequent coronary angiographies at the Cleveland Clinic, all patients with at least moderate CAV (>30%) on any coronary angiogram following OHT were included. Of remaining patients with no/mild CAV, 200 patients were randomly chosen to represent the comparison group. All angiograms of the included patients were reviewed and graded according to the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) nomenclature. Of the 393 included patients, 100 patients underwent definitive intervention for CAV. Of these 100 patients, 90 patients underwent PCI only, 6 patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, and 4 patients underwent repeat OHT. We observed a progressive increase in long-term mortality with worsening CAV. Patients with ISHLT grade 3 CAV had the highest long-term mortality compared with other groups. In addition, there was a significant reduction in the risk for mortality at 2-year follow-up (adjusted odds ratio: 0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08 to 0.82) and 5-year follow-up (adjusted odds ratio: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.93) after PCI compared with patients diagnosed with ISHLT grade 3 CAV, who were deemed unsuitable for PCI. Furthermore, statin use was associated with a significant survival benefit in patients with CAV (hazard ratio: 0.21; 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.61). Worsening severity of CAV was associated with progressively worse long-term survival among heart transplant recipients. Among patients with CAV, long-term survival in those with CAV amenable to PCI was greater than that in those with severe CAV not treatable with PCI.
