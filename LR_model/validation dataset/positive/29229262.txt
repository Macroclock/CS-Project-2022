Heart Transplantation in Patients >60 Years: Importance of Relative Pulmonary Hypertension and Right Ventricular Failure on Midterm Survival. To determine the impact of recipient age and perioperative risk factors on midterm survival after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). The authors hypothesized that perioperative variables are more important as predictors of mortality than is a recipient's age. Retrospective study. Tertiary care university hospital. The study comprised 126 consecutive adults who underwent OHT. After Institutional Review Board approval, the authors analyzed 126 consecutive adult patients who underwent OHT between January 2009 and December 2015 and followed-up with them up until June 2016. Patients were divided into the following 2 groups according to the recipient's age at the time of transplantation: older group (≥60 y old) and younger group (18 to 59 y). Actuarial survival rates for all patients were 88.1%, 78.6%, and 72.2% at 30 days, 1 year, and after a median follow-up of 18.9 months (midterm survival) (1st quartile: 8.1; 3rd quartile: 37.4), respectively. In the unadjusted analysis, the older group demonstrated a significant increase in 1-year mortality (p = 0.005) and a trend toward worse midterm mortality (p = 0.087). Multivariable analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Independent risk factors related to midterm mortality after OHT were as follows: preoperative relative pulmonary hypertension using the mean arterial-to-mean pulmonary artery pressure ratio ≤3 (hazard ratio [HR] 5.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.64-17.74, p = 0.006); cardiopulmonary bypass duration (per each 10-min increment) (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.08-1.22, p < 0.001); and postoperative right ventricular dysfunction (HR 3.50, 95% CI 1.52-8.05, p = 0.003). Neither recipients ≥60 years old (HR 2.15, 95% CI 0.98-4.67, p = 0.054) nor donor/recipient body surface area ratio (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98-1.04, p = 0.463) was an independent risk factor for midterm mortality. In patients undergoing heart transplantation, survival was related more to preoperative relative pulmonary hypertension, cardiopulmonary bypass duration, and postoperative right ventricular failure than to recipient age. Older patients should be selected for OHT carefully, taking into consideration preoperative factors other than age.
