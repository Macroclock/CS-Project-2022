The impact of tacrolimus as rescue therapy in children using a double immunosuppressive regimen after heart transplantation. Organ transplant recipients with refractory rejection or intolerance to the prescribed immunosuppressant may respond to rescue therapy with tacrolimus. We sought to evaluate the clinical outcomes of children undergoing heart transplantation who required conversion from a cyclosporine-based, steroid-free therapy to a tacrolimus-based regimen. We performed a prospective, observational, cohort study of 28 children who underwent conversion from cyclosporine-based, steroid-free therapy to a tacrolimus-based therapy for refractory or late rejection or intolerance to cyclosporine. There was complete resolution of refractory rejection episodes and adverse side effects in all patients. The incidence rate (×100) of rejection episodes before and after conversion was 7.98 and 2.11, respectively (P ≤ .0001). There was a 25% mortality rate in patients using tacrolimus after a mean period of 60 months after conversion. Tacrolimus is effective as rescue therapy for refractory rejection and is a therapeutic option for pediatric patients.
