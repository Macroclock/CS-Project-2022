Can Leukocyte Telomere Length Predict Survival Time in Heart Transplant Recipients over a Minimal Follow-Up of 20 years? In humans, leukocyte telomere length (LTL) reduces with age and is reported to be inversely associated with ageing-related diseases. We measured LTL in leukocyte DNA using a quantitative PCR-based method from 127 blood samples of heart recipients (107 males, 20 females, age 44.1 Â± 10.5), followed for up to 30 years. Patients with coronary artery disease survived for a shorter time and also had shorter LTL (both P < 0.05 after adjustment for age and sex) than subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy. Patients with non-cardiac causes of death had shorter LTL than patients with cardiac causes (P < 0.05 after adjustment for age). An inverse correlation between LTL and age (P < 0.03) was observed in patients with non-cardiac causes of death only. Most importantly, LTL was not associated with general survival time in patients after heart transplantation. However, shorter LTL was a marker of non-cardiac causes of death. Different LTLs and survival times were determined in association with aetiology of heart failure (HF).
