Persistent mild lesions in coronary angiography predict poor long-term survival of heart transplant recipients. Even though coronary angiography (CAG) underestimates coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) development, especially in the distal parts of arteries, it remains a frame of reference for International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) CAV classification. A retrospective analysis was performed to assess the prognostic value of CAG findings. Among 310 orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) recipients with at least 2 CAGs at 2-year intervals, we identified 197 (146 men and 41 women; 55 ± 13 years) without lesions (Group 0), 27 (15 men and 12 women; 58 ± 8 years) in whom mild changes remained in consecutive CAGs (Group 1), 28 (24 men and 4 women; 58 ± 10 years) in whom mild lesions decreased in consecutive CAGs (Group 1REG), and 58 (53 men and 5 women; 56 ± 10 years) in whom the stenosis criteria of ISHLT CAV 2 or 3 were covered (Group 2). We compared survival and other clinical variables among the groups. The average follow-up was 10 ± 4 years. Forty-one (21%) deaths occurred in Group 0, 15 (56%) in Group 1 (p = 0.002), 9(31%) in Group 1REG (p = NS), and 26 (46%) in Group 2 (p = 0.004, chi-square test). Time free from all-cause death was significantly shorter in Group 1 (T1/2 = 8 years) than in Group 0 (T1/2 = 15.5 years; p = 0.00072, log-rank test). Time free from cardiovascular death was significantly shorter in Groups 1 and 2, as was time free from CAV-related death in Groups 1, 1REG, and 2. Multivariate analysis, using a Cox proportional hazards model, revealed that Group 1 inclusion criterion of CAG findings is an independent predictor of all-cause death, cardiovascular death, and CAV-related death. Persistent mild coronary lesions, observed in consecutive CAG, predicted shorter survival of OHT recipients.
