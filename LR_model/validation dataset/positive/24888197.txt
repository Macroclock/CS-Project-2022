[Predictors of survival after heart transplantation: role of pretransplantation and posttransplantation factors]. Objective of this study was to assess the impact of pre- and posttransplantation factors on 12-month survival after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). Annual survival after OHT was 79.2%. The following factors were significantly negatively associated with annual survival: recipient's serum C-reactive protein (CRP) > or = 11.5 mg/ml prior to donor heart transplant (odds ratio [OR] 5.74, p = 0.011) and infectious complications after OHT (OR = 4.80, p = 0.009). Recipient's high CRP level was associated with mortality due to infectious complications (r(pb) = 0.47, p = 0.006), elevated troponin I concentrations (r(s) = 0.44, p = 0.012), and impaired hemodynamics of both recipient's heart and graft: right ventricular (RV) end diastolic area (EDA) prior to OHT (r(s) = 0.41, p = 0.015), elevated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) (r(s) = 0.36, p < 0.001), and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (r(s) = -0.45, p < 0.001) of the transplanted heart. Hearts of those who died after OHT irrespective of cause of death were characterized by more severe right heart dilation as evidenced by statistically significant increase of median RV EDA prior to OHT. After heart transplantation in those who later died decreased RV contractility was accompanied with elevation of PAP and decrease of LVEF. Acute graft rejection events 71.4% of which occurred in patients younger than 30 years had no influence on survival during 12 months after OHT. Other factors not associated with 12 months survival were donor and recipient age, pretransplant pathology, patient's UNOS status, graft ischemia duration, artificial circulatory support and preexistent surgical interventions. Development of diabetes mellitus in posttransplantation period, arterial hypertension and sinus node dysfunction requiring permanent pacing also were not identified as factors affecting 1 year survival after OTH.
