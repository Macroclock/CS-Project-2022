The Spanish Lung Transplant Registry: first report of results (2006-2010). The Spanish Lung Transplant Registry (SLTR) began its activities in 2006 with the participation of all the lung transplantation (LT) groups with active programs in Spain. This report presents for the first time an overall description and results of the patients who received lung transplants in Spain from 2006 to 2010. LT activity has grown progressively, and in this time period 951 adults and 31 children underwent lung transplantation. The mean age of the recipients was 48.2, while the mean age among the lung donors was 41.7. In adult LT, the most frequent cause for lung transplantation was emphysema/COPD, followed by idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, both representing more than 60% the total number of indications. The probability for survival after adult LT to one and three years was 72% and 60%, respectively, although in patients who survived until the third month post-transplantation, these survival rates reached 89.7% and 75.2%. The factors that most clearly influenced patient survival were the age of the recipient and the diagnosis that indicated the transplantation. Among the pediatric transplantations, cystic fibrosis was the main cause for transplantation (68%), with a one-year survival of 80% and a three-year survival of 70%. In adult as well as pediatric transplantations, the most frequent cause of death was infection. These data confirm the consolidated situation of LT in Spain as a therapeutic option for advanced chronic respiratory disease, both in children as well as in adults.
