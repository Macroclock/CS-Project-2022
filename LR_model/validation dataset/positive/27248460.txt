Cardiac replacement therapies: outcomes and costs for heart transplantation versus circulatory assist. Growing number of patients with terminal heart failure and a shortage of heart donors have increased use of short- and long-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS). Few studies have analyzed survival rates and healthcare costs for heart transplantation (HTx), with or without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and left ventricular assist device (LVAD). In a retrospective, single-center study, data were analyzed from patients listed for HTx who died on the waiting list (DWL, n = 12), underwent HTx (n = 206), had ECMO as bridge to HTx (ECHTx, n = 15), or received LVAD treatment, either isolated (LVAD, n = 19) or bridging to HTx (LVADHTx, n = 26) during 2005-2012. Survival and hospital costs were assessed. One- and five-year survival rates were 96% and 83% for the LVADHTx group, 92% and 81% for HTx, 70% and 70% for ECHTx, 48% and 36% for LVAD and 0% for the DWL group (overall survival, p < 0.001). Total hospital cost at one year was $102,101 ± 202,604 for DWL, $151,685 ± 86,892 for HTx, $292,078 ± 101,915 for ECHTx, $427,337 ± 365,154 for LVAD, and $600,897 ± 198,109 for LVADHTx. The LVADHTx and HTx groups showed excellent one- and five-year survival. The combined group of DWL and HTx patients had similar survival to the combined groups of MCS, but use of LVAD pre-transplant quadrupled the cost.
