Outcome after heart transplantation from donation after circulatory-determined death donors. The requirement for heart transplantation is increasing, vastly outgrowing the supply of hearts available from donation after brain death (DBD) donors. Transplanting hearts after donation after circulatory-determined death (DCD) may be a viable additive alternative to DBD donors. This study compared outcomes from the largest single-center experience of DCD heart transplantation against matched DBD heart transplants. DCD hearts were retrieved using normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) or direct procurement and perfusion (DPP). During NRP, perfusion was restored to the arrested heart within the donor with the exclusion of the cerebral circulation, whereas DPP hearts were removed directly. All hearts were maintained on machine perfusion during transportation. A retrospective cohort of DBD heart transplants, matched for donor and recipient characteristics, was used as a comparison group. The primary outcome measure of this study (set by the United Kingdom regulatory body) was 90-day survival. There were 28 DCD heart transplants performed during the 25-month study period. Survival at 90 days was not significantly different between DCD and matched DBD transplant recipients (DCD, 92%; DBD, 96%; p = 1.0). Hospital length of stay, treated rejection episodes, allograft function, and 1-year survival (DCD, 86%; DBD, 88%; p = 0.98) were comparable between groups. The method of retrieval (NRP or DPP) was not associated with a difference in outcome. These results suggest that heart transplantation from DCD heart donation provides comparable short-term outcomes to traditional DBD heart transplants and can serve to increase heart transplant activity in well-selected patients.
