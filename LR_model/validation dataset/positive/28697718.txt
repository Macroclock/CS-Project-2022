High Survival and Mortality Characteristics in Heart Transplant Patients at a National Institute. The identification of variables related to the survival of heart transplant patients is vital for a good medical practice. Few studies have examined this issue in a Latin American population. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze, retrospectively, the survival and mortality characteristics of patients after heart transplant. Information on patients was obtained through review of medical records; we collected information on all patients who underwent this procedure from 2010 to 2015. Sociodemographic, clinical, and surgical characteristics associated with posttransplant mortality were analyzed. Survival over 5 years was determined with the Kaplan-Meier method. The overall survival rate of the 35 patients who underwent heart transplant was 85%. Those with low total cholesterol values (< 160 mg/dL) had a lower survival at 5 years than patients with higher values (74% vs 100%; P = .044). The overall mortality was 14.3%, and the main cause of death was acutegraft rejection (40%). Lower total cholesterol level (< 160 mg/dL; P = .036), presence of chronic kidney disease stage 1 (P = .049), intraoperative bleeding (> 600 mL; P = .013), and number of sepsis incidents (P = .03) were more frequent in patients who died. The survival in our institute at 5 years is higher than shown in the reported literature, and the mortality is lower. In addition, a low total cholesterol value negatively affects survival of heart transplant patients at 5 years.
